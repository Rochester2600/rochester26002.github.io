## What is a cryptoparty 

A Cryptoparty is a decentralized, global initiative to introduce the most basic cryptography software and the fundamental concepts of their operation to the general public, such as the Tor anonymity network, public key encryption (PGP/GPG), and OTR (Off The Record messaging). See the [Cryptoparty.is](https://www.cryptoparty.in) site for details on what other groups are doing.
