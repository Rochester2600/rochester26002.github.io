This will be Rochester 2600's first (and maybe only) cryptoparty. A [Cryptoparty](/pages/cryptoparty.html) is a hands on workshop that teaches anyone about important security and cryptography tools you can use to protect yourself. There will be a focus this time around on OpenPGP/GPG and the new operating systems QubesOS and SubgraphOS. 

What you need to participate:

* Laptop ideally with Linux installed on it
* Copy of your OpenPGP fingerprint
* Proof of identity

What you need to attend:

* Nothing. You can just lurk or ask questions.

**UPDATE 5/5**
