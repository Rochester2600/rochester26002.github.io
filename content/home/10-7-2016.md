The First Friday 2600 meeting will be a hilarious examination of the
separation of church and state while we sip our drinks and look at which
melts faster between two fluffy pillows and Andrew. Gah. Whatever.
Talks below:

* Jason: DEVOPs for dummies or how I learned to stop worrying about infosec and just script things for developers
* AntiTree: Tales Of Czech Support
* AntiTree: Android 7.0/1 Security
* JewNinja: First Keynote Presentation
