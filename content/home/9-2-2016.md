For thos interested, the meeting this month is a hilarious examination
of our feelings as we dive head first into a corpus of utterance tokens
upon which conformity has been defined by the paired utterance test.
Presentations this months include:

* AntiTree: This month in infosec
* AntiTree: ZCash: Shitcoin or Shitcoin?
* Cowboi Joe: Look what I can do with Ethereum
