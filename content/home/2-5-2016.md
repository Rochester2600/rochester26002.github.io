Black Elephant is our monthly holiday party where attendees come in an exchange the most horrible gifts possible. Please note this is not for the faint of heart. We will also have our monthly presentations along-side the gift exchange. Exchange is optional but again, be warned. 

Presentations:

* <s>G13: Sniffing your butt</s>
* AntiTree: Shamir's Secrets
* Algorythm: Nothing as always
* CowBoiJoe: "I can't tell you because I would have to kill you"
* x56: Something To Disclose
* All: Black Elephant Gift Sharing
