Get ready for a slap in the face of pride and prejudice while we open up
the forums to discuss a parasitic gap construction. Here is an agenda
for the night:

* AntiTree: This month in infosec
* Cowboi Joe: Ethereum is still a thing?
* Alex: The State Of Home Automation
* AntiTree: WiFi: It still sucks
