## Quiz: Just how Kafkaesque is the court that oversees NSA spying?

-   An undated file photo of famed author Franz Kafka.

- Founded in 1978 after the Watergate scandal and investigations by the Church Committee, the FISA court was supposed to be a bulwark against secret government surveillance.

- In 2006, it authorized the NSA call records program  the single largest domestic surveillance program in American history. The court in Franz Kafkas novel The Trial is a shadowy tribunal that tries (and executes) Josef K., the storys protagonist, without informing him of the crime hes charged with, the witnesses against him, or how he can defend himself.

- A few months before the Snowden disclosures, four senators asked the FISA court to declassify summaries of some of those opinions.

## How the end of Patriot Act provisions changes NSA surveillance

-  Trevor Paglen  Thanks to resistance from Senator Rand Paul and other members of the Senate, the provisions of the USA PatriotAct that were used to justify the National Security Administrations broad collection of phone call metadata have expired.

- The USA Freedom Act, in the form it was passed by the House of Representatives, would put the phone companies in charge of retaining call dataand allow the NSA to query that data where it rests. According to a letter sent by NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers to Senators Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Harry Reid (D-Nev.), shifting to a query at the provider model is achievable within 180 days, with provider cooperation.

- We are aware of no technical or security reasons why this cannot be tested and brought on line within the 180-day period [specified by the USA Freedom Act]. The NSA is very familiar with distributed query models that would be required for the new approach to worktheyre at the core of XKeyscore.

- If anything, it might actually help reduce the demands on the NSAs network connections to telco providers. XKeyscore currently provides a federated search capability that can query its data stores around the world for information related to a specific identifier.

- If the only real changes are to where the data is stored, metadata queries will still potentially be open to abuses such as those already documented by the NSAquerying phone metadata of girlfriends and ex-girlfriends, boyfriends and wives, and other random individuals. In other words, the technical substance of NSA phone record surveillance may change, but the capabilities will not.

## China cracks down further on VPNs as censorship intensifies

- Chinas government is cracking down further on the use of virtual private networks to circumnavigate its Great Firewall, as part of the ongoing game of whack-a-mole between censors and an increasingly tech-savvy population. Charlie Smith, co-founder of the censorship in China monitoring site GreatFire.org, said there has been a significant increase in the usage of VPN services over the last year.

- The knock-on effects of this can be seen through increased activity on blocked sites such as Twitter. However, Smith said the authorities have recently cracked down hard on the most popular commercial VPNs. New upstarts might garner the same attention once they hit critical masses of users.

- I hope that this does not happen, but recent trends indicate that this will be the likely end result. According to sources, the countrys hugely popular online shopping platform Taobao no longer sells VPNs, with keyword searches for the services now blocked.

- A search on Chinas Baidu reveals more people are asking where to buy VPNs, although there are still plenty of sites selling them. Adam Fisk, chief executive of free peer-to-peer internet censorship circumvention software Lantern, said VPNs are particularly vulnerable to blocking because censors can easily target their protocols. In contrast Lantern uses a combination of peer-to-peer overseas connections and tunnelling traffic through services censors dont want to block. To me this is an ongoing battle with continuing innovation on both sides.

- The service now has 500 million active users, raising the question of how practical it is becoming to police. Fisk said: I definitely think theres a danger of being too optimistic, but [ultimately] the government is fighting a battle against hundreds of millions of people who have a fundamental desire to access information and programmers who have a fundamental desire to innovate. Over the long term I think the latter will clearly win, but its unclear how long it will take, he added. Smith agreed: [We] believe that a combination of technological solutions and widespread adoption of these tools will make free access to information so commonplace that the authorities decide that there is no point in fighting back.

## Evil Wi-Fi captive portal could spoof Apple Pay to get users credit card data

- The vulnerability, based on the default behavior of iOS devices with Wi-Fi turned on, could be used to inject a fake captive portal page that imitates the Apple Pay interface. The attack leverages a well-known issue Ars has reported on in the past: iOS devices with Wi-Fi turned on will attempt by default to connect to any access point with a known SSID.

- A rogue access point could use a probe request capture to masquerade as a known network, and then throw up a pop-up screen masquerading as any web page or app. The Wandera attack uses this behavior to get a mobile device to connect and then presents a pop-up portal pagethe type usually used when connecting to a public WiFi service to present a Web-based login screenthat is designed to resemble an Apple Pay screen for entering credit card data.

- Using readily available technology, which they may be discretely carrying about their person, hackers can for the first time focus their efforts where their victims are at their most susceptibleat the checkout. The real vulnerability exploited here is iOS automatic WiFi connection and the format in which iOS displays captive portal pages.

- The Wandera researchers reccommended that Apple and Google should consider adopting a secure warning when displaying captive portal pages to users, so that users exercise caution. Additionally, they suggest that users close and re-open payment applications to enter credit card data and use the camera capture capability of the apps to input credit card data whenever possible. Ars spoke with an Apple spokesperson, and is awaiting an official response.

- However, as the screenshots show, this spoof looks considerably different from Apple Pays actual interface, and a card registration screen popping up after a transaction is hardly expected behavior for the service.

## Federal agency hit by Chinese hackers, around 4 million employees affected

- The Office of Personnel Management, the government agency that manages federal employees, announced Thursday that its network was breached in December 2014, potentially compromising the personal records of approximately 4 million former and current employees.

- The Washington Post, citing unnamed government officials, reported that the attack originated from Chinese hackers, and was the second major intrusion of the agency by China in less than a year.

- OPM has instituted additional network security precautions, including: restricting remote access for network administrators and restricting network administration functions remotely; a review of all connections to ensure that only legitimate business connections have access to the internet; and deploying anti-malware software across the environment to protect and prevent the deployment or execution of tools that could compromise the network.

## FBI: Apple and Google are helping ISIS by offering strong crypto

- Apple and Google are helping terrorism by offering users encrypted communications, a senior FBI official has told the House Homeland Security Committee in Congress, and US law enforcement needs to stop them from doing it. Michael Steinbach, assistant director in the FBIs Counterterrorism Division, told Congress that ISIS and other terrorist groups are using commercially available encryption technology to mask their activities, leading law enforcement surveillance to go dark.

- As far as the FBI is concerned, private companies must build technological solutions to prevent encryption above all else, the Washington Post reports Steinbach as saying. Thats a pretty sharp reverse ferret from the FBI, which four years ago was recommending encryption as a basic security measure.

- But Steinbach said evildoers are hiding behind US-made technology to mask their actions. Encryption appears to be a big problem for law enforcement, both foreign and domestic.

- But the FBI wasnt insisting on back door access to encryption; rather, it wants companies to work directly with law enforcement where necessary. Privacy above all other things, including safety and freedom from terrorism, is not where we want to go, Steinbach said.

- But the intelligence community is wedded to the idea that it should be easy to build an encryption system thats both secure and has a breakable access code. The problem is that the best minds in the field say doing so is mathematically impossible, and even if it were possible, youd be painting a target on your back by telling the world theres a hack available and daring them to find it.

## Typing 'http://:' Into a Skype Message Trashes the Installation Beyond Repair

- So much this. I usually defend MS against people who I believe unfairly attack them, but you've really struck a nerve. I don't know what team is responsible for Skype, but they have done such a mind boggling horrible job I'm half convinced they're intentionally trying to kill it, cut it into small pieces, then burn the remains before firing the ashes into the nearest black hole. Every single version they push out has been worse than the last, and the last good version was 6.18.

- Somehow it managed to uninstall itself and then couldn't reinstall itself because I replaced the update file with a dummy. They keep removing features but *promise* to put them back in... And even years later the features still haven't back in added.

- That's all Skype gets nowadays, useless improvements and worse performance.

- The calls I get with 6.18 are perfect but with any version 7 I may as well just write letters and send them through the mail. Oh but wait they changed the UI to be even worse!

- Maybe you should hire actual software developers instead of monkey interns who think smashing their face into a keyboard is an acceptable way to write software.

## Chinese snoops try tracking VPN users with fiendish JSONP trickery

- The attacks exploits vulnerabilities in the top Chinese websites, including those run by Baidu and Alibaba, and use cross-site request forgery to expose users accessing restricted sites.

- The JavaScript file exploits JSONP hijacking vulnerabilities in more than 15 different major Chinese websites, including the top five portals used in China

- It looks like this campaign has been targeting a very small group of people, and since there is no financial gain on collecting most of the leaked personal data, we can say that whoever is behind these attacks is looking to reveal the identity of the users visiting certain websites.

- However, bypassing the same-origin policy can lead to information leakage between different origins or domains. Since JSONP requests/responses bypass the same-origin policy, malicious sites can cause victims to make cross-domain JSONP requests and read the private data using the script tag. The GFW is able to analyze and block traffic that is leaving China, although these controls can be circumvented by Chinese users running VPNs or TOR.

- In these cases, the GFW doesnt have full visibility into the traffic that goes through VPNs or TOR. VPN users are more at risk than Tor browser users because of restrictions in handling JavaScript by the latter, as pointed out by the Tor Project, and reflected in an update to AlienVaultults blog post. The hacking attack outlined by AlienVault lifts the veil of anonymity, at least partially.

## Cops turn Download Festival into an ORWELLIAN SPY PARADISE

- 

- As if being ankle deep in a muddy field, surrounded by pretend hippies seemingly re-enacting highlights of the Battle of Waterloo was bad enough, attendees of the aptly named Download Festival will be subjected to a new police facial recognition system, and surveillance of their onsite location and expenditure via the debut of RFID wristbands. The surveillance technologies are a new facial recognition system being rolled out by Leicestershire Police, and Downloads own RFID wristbands, provided by German RFID specialists YouChip.

- Leicestershire Police have been trialling NEC Corporations NeoFace facial recognition system since April 2014, though they only announced the trial in July of that year, and seem to have been delighted with its results to date. NeoFace has compared facial images, captured by CCTV/IPTV recordings, with facial images stored in Leicestershires local custody database. NEC, however, advertises its NeoFace tech as being able to offer much more in biometrics surveillance, and while the particular system to be used at Download has not been revealed, it may also be part of the companys suite. NeoFace Watch is the mobile surveillance platform from the NeoFace suite, which functions by integrating face matching technology with video surveillance input, while checking individuals against known photographic watch lists, and producing real-time alerts, according to a product brochure. An interview with DC Kevin Walker, published in Police Oracle on Monday, revealed that: Strategically placed cameras will scan faces at the Download Festival site in Donington before comparing [them] with a database of custody images from across Europe. The Register has been told that the database of lawfully held European custody photos is a stand-alone database of legally held custody photographs drawn together with partners in Europol. In response to a Freedom of Information request The Reg filed to Leicestershire Police in April asking whether NeoFace had, or could, utilise information received from outside of its custody database  making specific reference to SIS II  we were told: NeoFace has been intentionally limited in scope to ensure that it only uses images held on our custody database.

- It is a stand-alone system that does not link with other national databases such as the PNC. This is true, The Register understands, as the real-time facial recognition system is being considered as a totally different project from the existing facial recognition system that the coppers are using. We have also learned that the Police Oracles publication of the interview caused significant upset for management at Leicestershire Police, who did not want any advance publicity of their new surveillance project. The public would have been informed that it had been placed under surveillance after the event had ended, presumably as part of a you didnt know, therefore it wasnt intrusive, justification for the scheme.

## No joke: Iceland's Pirate Party surges into first place in the polls

- In contrast to Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, which all have a long tradition of electing Social Democratic governments, Iceland's parliament has been dominated by right-of-center parties for all but four years since World War II.

- The only break in that streak came in 2009, when the left won for the first time everand elected the world's first openly gay head of state.

- The unusual result came about because the global financial meltdown hit Iceland with particular ferocity, but tradition seemingly reasserted itself four years later when the right-leaning Independence and Progressive parties regained power in a landslide. So it comes as a massive shock that the last few months of polling has shown the incumbent coalition hemorrhaging support not to the center-left Social Democrats or to the left-wing Left-Green Movement, but to the nascent Pirate Party, which has surged into the lead in public opinion polls due to dissatisfaction with the mainstream parties. Indeed, a recent Gallup survey found the Pirate Party with the support of 34 percent of voters while another found them with 35 percent.

- That puts the Pirates ahead of the Independence and Progressive Parties' combined support despite those two ruling-coalition partners winning 51 percent together just two years ago.

- They support market economics, but with a strong social safety net, universal health care, and high taxes to pay for servicesthe sort of governance you typically find in Nordic nations.

## Privacy Advocates Walk Out in Protest Over U.S. Facial Recognition Code of Conduct - The Intercept

-   Technology industry lobbyists have so thoroughly hijacked the Commerce Department process for developing a voluntary code of conduct for the use of facial recognition technology that nine privacy advocates involved withdrew in protest on Monday. At a base minimum, people should be able to walk down a public street without fear that companies theyve never heard of are tracking their every movement  and identifying them by name  using facial recognition technology, the privacy advocates wrote in a joint statement.

- Unfortunately, we have been unable to obtain agreement even with that basic, specific premise. The Commerce Department, through its National Telecommunications and Information Administration, brought together representatives from technology companies, trade groups, consumer groups, academic institutions and other organizations early last year to kick off an effort to craft privacy safeguards for the commercial use offacial recognition technology. The goal was to develop a voluntary, enforceable code of conduct that specifies how the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights applies to facial recognition technology in the commercial context. But after a dozen meetings, the most recent of which was last week, all nine privacy advocates who have participated in the entire process concluded that they were totally outgunned. This should be a wake-up call to Americans: Industry lobbyists are choking off Washingtons ability to protect consumer privacy, Alvaro Bedoya, executive director of the Center on Privacy  Technology at Georgetown Law, said in a statement. People simply do not expect companies theyve never heard of to secretly track them using this powerful technology.

- This position is well outside the mainstream. Ben Sobel, a researcher and Google Policy Fellow at the Center on Privacy  Technology, wrote last week for the Washington Post about the extraordinary advances in facial recognition technology that have gone largely unnoticed by the public.

- Being anonymous in public might be a thing of the past, he wrote. He noted that while there are no federal laws that specifically govern the use of facial recognition technology, some states do.

- That means that one out of every eight Americans currently has a legal right to biometric privacy, he wrote. (This post is from our blog:Unofficial Sources.

## Wi-Fi Router's 'Pregnant Women' Setting Sparks Vendor Rivalry In China

- "  Zhou Hongyi, chief executive and president of Qihoo, acknowledged in a statement to the South China Morning Post that there is no evidence supporting claims that Wi-Fi routers pose a risk for birth defects.

- But he said the company is appealing to consumers' beliefs, whether they are supported by science or not.  "We are targeting people who are afraid of radiation," Hongyi said.

- We haven't done many experiments to prove how much damage the radiation from Wi-Fi can cause.

## The Next Java Update Could Make Yahoo Your Default Search Provider

- Other platforms would be awesome, too, but Linux already has great OpenJDK support in package managers, so that may not even be necessary.

- If it does find one, it gives the user a simple "Yes/No/Ask Later" prompt: if they pick Yes, it'll silently remove the old OpenJDK version and install the new one; if they pick "No" it'll skip that version and only remind them when the next update comes out; and it'll bug them next week if they click "Ask Later".

- Once it finishes whatever it has to do, it EXITS, rather than remaining in virtual memory forever like the Oracle Java updater. (3) No adware.

- If they don't have admin rights, stick it in AppData\Local and put the plugins in a similarly user-scoped folder (not possible with IE as far as I know, but should work with Chrome and Firefox).

- Auto-detect whether the user can be an admin, and only give the UAC prompt if the user's account can actually accept the prompt; otherwise, fall back to "non-admin" install. Gee, sounds like if nothing like this exists, I have the requirements / design doc in my head... If I disappear in my room for a week and don't emerge until this thing is on github, tell my family and my cat that I love them.

Adobeacknowledged that the flaw (CVE-2015-3113) is being actively exploited in the wild via limited, targeted attacks. Known affected systems run Internet Explorer for Windows 7 and below and Firefox on Windows XP, according to the patch details.

- In 2015 alone, weve seen Adobe issue multiple emergency Flash updates topatch critical vulnerabilities under active attackincluding three such instances in the first five weeks of the year.

- According to the security researchers, APT3 has implemented these phishing schemes against companies in aerospace and defense, engineering, telecommunications, and transportation this year. FireEyes report onCVE-2015-3113 offers much greater detail than Adobes patch notes.

- Supplies are limited, but update frequently. Dont hesitate Go to Sale   FireEye also broke down where unfortunate targets were directed after clicking suchURLsacompromised server hosting JavaScript profiling scripts.

- This ultimately resulted in a custom backdoor known as SHOTPUT, detected by FireEye as Backdoor.APT.CookieCutter, being delivered to the victims system.The payload is obscured using xor encoding and appended to a valid GIF file.

## Talking Big Changes At Sparkfun With Nathan Seidle

- [Nate] prepared the staff far ahead of the public announcement and that included discussion and planning with [Pete] on how the two will work together with the engineering team.

- If that person can navigate the aforementioned issues, I think actually having [Nate] around for advice from time-to-time will help ensure the creative values and spirit of the company doesnt wash away. There it is, a sweet job for the taking.

- The company both manufactures and sells the device which turns anything into a computer keyboard, paying a royalty to the creators [Jay Silver] and [Eric Rosenbaum].

- But its not inconceivable that this could change. The company actually started using Protel (which later became Altium Designer) until the license fees became prohibitively expensive for the number of seats they needed.

- Saving all your designs privately can be done if you pay for a subscription. SparkFun plans to give CircuitMaker a try, and will also do so with KiCAD (the Free and Open Source EDA suite) in a few upcoming projects.

## HP Researchers Disclose Details of Internet Explorer Zero Day

- ">allow attackers to bypass a key exploit mitigation in Internet Explorer.

- The company typically does not publish complete details and exploit code for the bugs it reports to vendors until after the vulnerabilities are fixed.

- But in this case, Microsoft has told the researchers that the company doesn't plan to fix the vulnerabilities, even though the bugs were serous enough to win ZDI's team a $125,000 Blue Hat Bonus from Microsoft.

- The reason: Microsoft doesn't think the vulnerabilities affect enough users.  The vulnerabilities that the ZDI researchers submitted to Microsoft enable an attacker to fully bypass ASLR (address space layout randomization), one of the many mitigations in IE that help prevent successful exploitation of certain classes of bugs.

- ZDI reported the bugs to Microsoft last year and disclosed some limited details of them in February.

## Method for collecting semen from the ostrich (Struthio camelus) and some of its quantitative and qualitative characteristics. - PubMed - NCBI

- Abstract 1.

- Four methods of semen collecting that involved interruption of mating in two breeding ostrich pairs were tested: an artificial vagina was tested without promising results; the funnel method, in which a funnel was placed under the phallus of the tested male immediately after mating allowing semen drips to be collected; the vacuum method, using a turkey semen collector, inserted into the seminal canal; and the tube method, conducted by placing a test tube inside the seminal canal, allowing semen to enter by gravity.

- For the funnel, vacuum and tube methods, respectively, average semen volume was 0.1 +/- 0.02, 1.12 +/- 0.22, and 0.58 +/- 0.13 ml, sperm concentration was 0.66 +/- 0.14, 2.35 +/- 0.26, and 2.13 +/- 0.27 x 10(9) cells/ml, and percentage of abnormal cells was 5.82 +/- 1.79%, 4.68 +/- 1.19%, and 7.09 +/- 1.72%.

- Semen characteristics varied throughout the reproductive season reaching peak concentration in June-July.

- The vacuum method proved to be the most efficient and was a low stress, restraint-free method for collecting ostrich semen.

## 5G Network Speed Defined As 20 Gbps By the International Telecommunication Union

- Why the huge jump?It is actually kind of sad if you know their history. Back in the day they were competing with Palm, and had Windows CE and Pocket PC 2000.

- When PocketPC 2002 came out my employer switched over from Palm and I got to rewrite a bunch of tools.

- It knocked Palm down several notches in the mobile market, with Palm losing value and getting bought out in 2005. The fun thing about that era is that there were phones with PDAs in them, you can go back to "Pocket PC Phone Edition" for that.

- Each version of Windows Mobile supported running in phones, but they never took off. The iPod was getting some power and some apps, but I loved that with a single CF card I could have my entire music library on my device; the Axim x51v used the same audio chipset as the iPod of the era coupled with better playback software where you could mix and such.

- At the time I didn't really see the reason for the hype, when it came to processor power, memory, and even 3D graphics the iPhone was less powerful than my Windows 6 phone. As the numbers came back, iOS rose and WM feel by the same percent; the other companies were flat in market share.

## Chromium suddenly starts downloading a binary blob [LWN.net]

- Even if the binary only does what it is purported to do, it can turn on the microphone and upload what it hears to a remote site to search for a key phrase.

- That description sounds a lot like one for the latest malware outbreakor National Security Agency (NSA) eavesdropping program. It is not (yet) clear how this came aboutprosaic explanations seem most likely, in truthbut it did make its way into Debian unstable without being noticed.

- By June 15, Debian had done just that and updated its version of Chromium. There is plenty to be disturbed about here, but it seems pretty unlikely this was some deliberate scheme by Google (or the Chromium team).

- Even if Google is completely trustworthy with respect to what the program does (and there is no reason to believe it isn't) it is still a bit worrisome that your browser can simply execute whatever code its corporate master orders it to.

- We are increasingly required to trust the various sites, companies, and organizations that we deal with on a daily basis on today's internet. Given the way Chromium uses certificate pinning, a man in the middle would not have been able to deliver some other version of NaCl executable.

## Chrome, Debian Linux, and the secret binary blob download riddle

- That hasnt stopped Debian users from wondering how the issue got past project maintainers in the first place. Debian user Yoshihito Yoshino first raised the red flag on the projects bug report mailing list in May, after noticing suspicious network activity from Chromium 43, the most recent stable release of the open source version of the Chrome browser.

- After upgrading chromium to 43, I noticed that when it is running and immediately after the machine is on-line it silently starts downloading Chrome Hotword Shared Module extension, which contains a binary without source code, Yoshino wrote.

- There seems no opt-out config. Under the Debian Social Contract, distributing software without accompanying source code is a serious no-no.

- The fact that an important software package from an eminent contributor has distributed code sans source, without anyone noticing, has left some Debian users asking whether the project needs stricter controls. Even worse for some users was the nature of the proprietary code that Chromium downloaded.

- It was reportedly a library that supported Googles OK Google voice recognition feature, which some security researchers have pointed out is a potential open door for invasion of privacy. The fact that Audio Capture Allowed is set to yes, and that both the extension and the shared module are marked as enabled are definitely bothering me, wrote Debian bug forum participant Yves-Alexis Perez. Other commenters went on to say that removing the browser extension that relies on the Hotword Shared Module was difficult, and that other bug reports suggest that even disabling it in the browsers settings might not keep it from running. On Monday, Debian maintainer Michael Gilbert chimed in to say that the bug has been fixed, and the latest version of the Chromium package will no longer download the Hotword code by default. That hasnt appeased Debian user Christoph Anton Mitterer, who asked that a Debian Security Announcement be raised over the issue. Since no one really know which binaries have been downloaded there and what they actually do, and since it cannot be excluded that it was actually executed, such systems are basically to be considered compromised, Mitterer wrote to the bug report list. Mitterer even questioned whether Google should be trusted as an upstream contributor to the Debian project following the incident, especially given that the online ad giants known cooperation with US government data snooping, voluntary and otherwise. Anyway, I havent said that banning such software from Debian would be the only solution but at least these incidents come far too frequent recently, so apparently something needs to be done at Debian level to pro-actively prevent future cases/compromises like this.

## The Blue Team Myth

- I'm going to go out on a limb here and just say that I recognize that the consultants may not have been able to trace the breach information back to the initial infection vector (IIV) in every case, so the numbers in the report are likely just a little fuzzy. What the numbers tell us is that the consultants, based on their combined experience, knowledge, and methodologies, were able to find indicators and artifacts that others did not.

- This means that the local IT staff either wasn't looking, or didn't have a complete understanding of what to look for. The numbers in the reports are supported by my own experiences, as well as those of a myriad of other responders.

- Based on my own personal experiences, I would say that the answer is a definite yes. By now, we are all well aware that prevention doesn't work, that regardless of how many technical measures we put in place, that as long as people are involved in some way, at some point someone will make their way into an infrastructure.

- So what we need to do is include detection and response; put our protection mechanisms in place, monitor them, look/hunt for issues throughout our infrastructure, and be ready to take some sort of action when issues are found. In my previous blog post, I shared some thoughts on hunting, in short, describing, in general terms, what folks can look for within their environments.

- Check out this video of Lee's presentation...he shares a lot of great information.

## Reassessing Airport Security

- But theres another conclusion, inescapable and disturbing to many, but good news all around: we dont need $7 billion worth of airport security.

- Previous TSA excuses were that the results were isolated to a single airport, or not realistic simulations of terrorist behavior.

- We know that current screening technologies are terrible at detecting the plastic explosive PETN  thats what the underwear bomber had  and that a disassembled weapon has an excellent chance of getting through airport security.

- If there were lots of terrorists just waiting for us to let our guard down to destroy American planes, we would have seen attacks  attempted or successful  after all these years of screening failures.

- I generally am opposed to security measures that require us to correctly guess the terrorists tactics and targets.

## crypto is finished... and it's about time  (also: 'Balrog' malnet, firsthand view) - cryptostorm darknet member forum

- This knowledge base all but obligates me to share what I have learned, such as it is, so others can leverage the hard-won bits of insight I've been able to collate from all this dirty tech. The second goal of this paper is to communicate the scale, scope, and pressing urgency of CINs as a research and mitigation subject of highest priority to anyone working in the information security field today.

- Cryptostorm has not, nor do we claim to have, "discovered a new exploit" or attack vector that nobody has previously noted or published. The sense of urgency and... dread (not the right word, but it'll do for now) we feel and are communicating recently isn't based on a novel discovery. Even more so, the entire concept of CINs - if not the name itself - and the example of one created by the NSA, were thrown into stark, inescapably real status by the whistleblowing of Edward Snowden in 2013.

- } Or for another way of saying it in the NSA's own words, dating from 2009...  name your poison Once I realised this was about quite a bit more than simply borked svg's (which is still a pretty interesting vector, imho), I pulled out the name #SauronsEye for what I was experiencing: a totalising, all-seeing, ever-present, burning glare from a height.

- Trust me on this: even if you are successful in disinfecting (and that'll require expertise in grub, Xen, containers, obscure filesystem formats, font encoding, archaic network protocols down the OSI stack, and on and on and on), dare to actually use the computer to communicate with others online, and you'll be right back to the alien-bursting-from-stomach place in short order. Neither cryptostorm, nor cryptography, can protect you from Balrog, or from CINs.

- Those aren't the attackers we worry about much, do we? I mean, if we put a lock on our door that would be totally effective in keeping out newborn babies, caterpillars, and midsized aggregations of Spanish Moss - but was useless against some dude who just hits the door with his shoulder to pop it open - then it'd be less than wise to go cavorting about the neighbourhood, crowing to all who can hear that you left 500 pound sterling on the kitcken table and too bad suckers, no mewling infant will ever find her way in to steal that currency... wouldn't it? That's https. Indeed, I have a... something between a theory, and a strangely intense fantasy... concept that PEM-encoded certs themselves are being used as an implant vector by Balrog  Or, as my colleague graze prefers to (more reasonably) suspect, strangely-formatted packets for use in transporting data between Balrog-sickened victims and the MalCloud of Balrog's control architecture, globally.

## OpenSSL releases seven patches for seven vulns

- 

- Users are being urged to upgrade OpenSSL to prevent eavesdroppers listening to otherwise encrypted connections undermined through the LogJam vulnerability thought to be the NSAs crypto-cracking tool of choice. OpenSSL maintainers have patched seven vulnerabilities including the LogJam vulnerability (CVE-2015-4000) which allows attackers to trick browsers into considering an insecure encrypted connection as secure.

- A vulnerability in the TLS protocol allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to downgrade vulnerable TLS connections using ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange to 512-bit export-grade cryptography, OpenSSL maintainers wrote in an advisory. OpenSSL has added protection for TLS clients by rejecting handshakes with DH parameters shorter than 768 bits.

- This limit will be increased to 1024 bits in a future release. Users should upgrade OpenSSL 1.0.2 to 1.0.2b and 1.0.1 to 1.0.1n. LogJam was found as part of the investigation into the FREAK vulnerability which allows secure TLS connections to be downgraded to use weak export-quality encryption. LogJam cloaks this process. Some 20,000 websites are exposed to the flaw where attackers can using the same network as victims target some 575 cloud services to man-in-the-middle attacks, according to Skyhigh Networks statistics. The research reveals the average company uses 71 potentially vulnerable cloud services.

## Obama issues HTTPS-only order to US Federal sysadmins

- 

- Black Hat Barack has issued a Memorandum  an executive order in all but name, and an instrument the president has used more than any of his predecessors  to all Federal website sysadmins, informing them to deprecate HTTP and roll on with HTTPS. The HTTPS-Only Standard was proposed by the US Chief Information Officer Tony Scott, formerly of VMWare.

- Though the standard has been criticised by a database admin at NASA as a top-down solution, it has also been described as a great first step by the American Civil Liberties Union. The Memorandum [PDF] itself states that all browsing activity should be considered private and sensitive.  This Memorandum requires that all publicly accessible Federal websites and web services only provide service through a secure connection.

- The strongest privacy and integrity protection currently available for public web connections is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).  The standard is intended to eliminate inconsistent, subjective determinations across agencies regarding which content or browsing activity is sensitive in nature, Tony Scott said.

- As such, the crimeware is picking up the baton that dropped with the takedown of the infamous CryptoLocker ransomware scam in May last year.

- Once infected, security software cannot detect the associated malware stored in a hidden area of the drive.  Although not identified as such by Intel Security, the Equation Group has been linked to elite units of the NSA, via confirmation by former staffers. We at Intel take hybrid software-hardware threats and exploits seriously, said Vincent Weafer, senior vice president, McAfee Labs.

- While such malware has historically been deployed for highly-targeted attacks, enterprises should prepare themselves for the seemingly inevitable off-the-shelf incarnations of such threats in the future. Lastly, the security firms research report flags up a flare up of Adobe Flash exploits targeting unpatched vulnerabilities.

- New Adobe Flash malware samples detected skyrocketed to almost 200,000 in Q12015, an increase of 317 per cent from the 47,000 samples detected in the last quarter of 2014. Forty-two new Adobe Flash vulnerabilities were submitted to the National Vulnerability Database in Q1.

- On the same day those vulnerabilities were posted, Adobe made initial fixes available for all 42 vulnerabilities. The full-fat, 45-page version of McAfee Labs report can be found here (PDF).

- Bridges was part of the taskforce that nailed former Silk Road admin Curtis Green and boss Ross Ulbricht, and was one of two G-men who stole Bitcoins from the site.

- he used administrative credentials to raid drug dealer accounts prompting UIbricht to contact a murder-for-hire hit against Green who he suspected of the theft.

- Second agent Carl Force is accused of blackmailing Ulbricht out of $235,000 to an account in Panama, and later offering the drug boss information on the police operation in exchange for Bitcoin.

- The agent did not hand over his PGP key to bosses used to encrypt his conversations with Ulbricht leading the feds to suspect he was hiding something.

- Later analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain showed a transaction between Ulbricht and Force.

## How to hijack MILLIONS of Samsung mobes with man-in-the-middle diddle

- Samsung smartphones can be hijacked, infected with malware, and remotely controlled by malicious Wi-Fi hotspots in cafes, hotels, and so on, security researchers claim. According to the bods at NowSecure, millions of handsets have a remote-code execution vulnerability that is a software design flaw.

- One workaround is to avoid untrusted wireless; use VPN to a trusted network; or simply use another phone.

- Essentially, NowSecure claims, the touchscreen keyboard app bundled with Samsung Galaxy S6, S5, S4 and S4 Mini handsets automatically updates itself by downloading a ZIP file of new files from the internet using an unencrypted HTTP connection. It makes no attempt to verify the authenticity of the archive, its claimed, so someone in control of your network could intercept the download, and send the phone a malicious archive instead. The update process runs with system-level access.

- This means a malicious archive could overwrite arbitrary files on the handset, replacing the installed software with malware, or just cause havoc, were told. The ZIP archive is downloaded from  http://skslm.swiftkey.net/samsung/downloads/v1.3-USA/az_AZ.zip  and if, for example, it contains a file with the full filename  ../../../../../../../../data/payload  then, when unpacked by the update process, it will create a system-owned file in the directory /data:  $ su -c "ls -l /data/payload" -rw------- system   system          5 2014-08-22 16:07 payload  Which is bad. The system keyboard app cannot be uninstalled, and if deactivated and replaced by another on-screen keyboard app, it will continue to run its update process in the background with full system privileges every so often. Its unfortunate but typical for OEMs and carriers to preinstall third-party applications to a device, NowSecure researcher Ryan Welton wrote in a blog post.

- This is the case with the keyboard on Samsung. This vulnerability is specific to Samsung devices, and we have observed it as far back as Android 4.2 and possibly even farther back, a spokesman for NowSecure added to The Register. SwiftKey provided the software at the heart of Samsungs system keyboard, and said its standalone keyboard apps are not vulnerable. Weve seen reports of a security issue related to the Samsung stock keyboard that uses the SwiftKey SDK, a spokesperson told El Reg on Tuesday. We can confirm that the SwiftKey Keyboard app available via Google Play or the Apple App Store is not affected by this vulnerability. NowSecure has published a proof-of-concept exploit that it says will execute code remotely on affected handsets.

## Serious OS X and iOS flaws let hackers steal keychain, 1Password contents

- But roughly speaking, such malware can do no more (and actually considerably less) than what a malicious browser extension could do in your browser. Goldberg, whose company develops and markets 1Password, went on to advise users how to make themselves less susceptible to the attack and to thank the researchers for exposing the problem. Password stealing is when a malicious app exploits a subtle design weakness in the OS X keychain, which stores passwords and other credentials used by browsers and other apps.

- Once the end user enters it again, the malicious app will be able to retrieve it. A video demonstration of the attack follows: Keychain attack demo: steal iCloud authentication token.  Container cracking: Containers are designed to store the contacts, passwords, and other contents in highly restricted directories and subdirectories named after the BID assigned to the sandboxed app.

- The researchers malicious app was able to take ownership of the Wunderlist URL scheme and then steal the Google Single Sign On login credential transmitted by the browser.

- Interestingly, they said application sandboxing in Googles Android OS was much better at withstanding XARA threats. For the time being, the researchers told Ars, there isnt much end users can do except wait for Apple to fix the vulnerabilities.

- At the request of Apple, the researchers delayed disclosing their findings for six months to give developers a head start in hardening OS X and iOS against the attacks.

## Apples Password Storing Keychain Cracked on iOS & OS X

- And another password shocker, a few days after cloud password service LastPass was pretty seriously hacked (yah if youre using it, change your master password) critical 0-day flaws in Apples password storing keychain have been exposed.  Which is kinda funny, as after the LastPass hack I saw some people espousing the usage of Apples keychain as much more secure.

- And now, Apples keychain cracked  and in a really serious way. Six university researchers have revealed deadly zero-day flaws in Apples iOS and OS X, claiming it is possible to crack Apples password-storing keychain, break app sandboxes, and bypass its App Store security checks. Attackers can steal passwords from installed apps, including the native email client, without being detected, by exploiting these bugs. The team was able to upload malware to the Apple app store, passing the vetting process without triggering alerts.

- That malware, when installed on a victims device, raided the keychain to steal passwords for services including iCloud and the Mail app, and all those stored within Google Chrome. Lead researcher Luyi Xing told El Reg he and his team complied with Apples request to withhold publication of the research for six months, but had not heard back as of the time of writing. They say the holes are still present in Apples software, meaning their work will likely be consumed by attackers looking to weaponize the work. Apple was not available for immediate comment. Its pretty serious as they managed to bypass the app store vetting and can grab access tokens and data from other apps on the device including high profile apps like Facebook, Evernote and iCloud itself even while sandboxed. The sad part is, Apple was notified about this 6 months ago and still havent fixed it  the only fast moving response came from Googles Chromium security team who removed keychain integration for Chrome, noting that it could likely not be solved at the application level. Recently we discovered a set of surprising security vulnerabilities in Apples Mac OS and iOS that allows a malicious app to gain unauthorised access to other apps sensitive data such as passwords and tokens for iCloud, Mail app and all web passwords stored by Google Chrome, Xing told The Registers security desk. Our malicious apps successfully went through Apples vetting process and was published on Apples Mac app store and iOS app store. We completely cracked the keychain service  used to store passwords and other credentials for different Apple apps  and sandbox containers on OS X, and also identified new weaknesses within the inter-app communication mechanisms on OS X and iOS which can be used to steal confidential data from Evernote, Facebook and other high-profile apps. The team was able to raid banking credentials from Google Chrome on the latest OS X 10.10.3, using a sandboxed app to steal the systems keychain data and secret iCloud tokens, and passwords from password vaults. If any malicious teams are out there using this, it could be really bad  and well if they arent already using it my bet is they will be by tomorrow. I guess itll probably be blocked from the app store by then though, now its getting widespread media coverage.

## Apple CORED: Boffins reveal password-killer 0-days for iOS and OS X

-  Photos were stolen from WeChat, and the token for popular cloud service Evernote was nabbed, allowing it to be fully compromised. The consequences are dire, the team wrote in the paper. Some 88.6 per cent of 1,612 OS X and 200 iOS apps were found completely exposed to unauthorized cross-app resource access (XARA) attacks allowing malicious apps to steal otherwise secure data. Xing says he reported the flaws to Apple in October 2014. 

-  Apple security bods responded to the researchers in emails seen by El Reg expressing understanding for the gravity of the attacks, and asked for at least six months to fix the problems.

- In February, the Cupertino staffers requested an advanced copy of the research paper. Googles Chromium security team was more responsive, and removed keychain integration for Chrome, noting that it could likely not be solved at the application level. AgileBits, owner of popular software 1Password, said it could not find a way to ward off the attacks nor make the malware work harder some four months after it was warned of the vulnerabilities.

- (Neither we nor Luyi Xing and his team have been able to figure out a completely reliable way to solve this problem, said AgileBitss Jeffrey Goldberg in a blog post today.

- The researchers found security-critical vulnerabilities including cross-app resource-sharing mechanisms and communications channels such as the keychain, WebSocket and Scheme. Note that not only does our attack code circumvent the OS-level protection but it can also get through the restrictive app vetting process of the Apple Stores, completely defeating its multi-layer defense, the researchers wrote in the paper. They say almost all XARA flaws arise from Apples cross-app resource sharing and communication mechanisms such as keychain for sharing passwords, BID based separation, and URL scheme for app invocation, which is different from how the Android system works. Their research, previously restricted to Android, would lead to a new line of work for the security community studying how the vulnerabilities affect Apple and other platforms. Heres the boffins description of their work: Our study brings to light a series of unexpected, security-critical aws that can be exploited to circumvent Apples isolation protection and its App Stores security vetting.

## But ... but iOS 9 could BLOCK my Ad-Block, dev squeals

- Apple appears to have added an ad-blocking capability to iOS 9, stoking hopes and fears in different quarters. The beta version of the operating system sports a Content Blocking Safari Extensions feature which Apple says will give extensions a fast and efficient way to block cookies, images, resources, pop-ups, and other content.

- It doesnt contain ad blocking capabilties as such and instead required ad blocking software to be installed - and to interact with Safari via JSON. Your app extension is responsible for supplying a JSON file to Safari.

- The JSON consists of an array of rules (triggers and actions) for blocking specified content, Apples developer notes say. Safari converts the JSON to bytecode, which it applies efficiently to all resource loads without leaking information about the users browsing back to the app extension.

- Xcode includes a Content Blocker App Extension template that contains code to send your JSON file to Safari. But the feature could kill popular advertising blockers, according to Sebastian Noack of Ad-Block - depending on whether it forces the apps to rely on inferior mechanisms. Noack says the JSON file block lists is a large departure from the current framework of running arbitray code on request to kill advertising based on URLs and context. We appreciate and support Apples attempts to finally catch up on extensions, but those latest changes will create either the best possible landscape for Safari extensions, or the worst  especially for Adblock Plus, Noack says. In short, either this new API will improve Adblock Plus performance on Safari or it will force us to rely upon an inferior blocking format that would essentially kill adblocking on Safari. So, we are nervously awaiting how powerful their block lists will be, most importantly when it comes to matching the document domain and request type, as well as regular expression matching of URLs and recursive exception rules. The mechanism will at best allow for a solid iOS advertising blocker or at worst mean the end of the facility on the operating system. It is yet uncertain if the feature is operational as of publication of this article.

## US Teen Pleads Guilty To Teaching ISIS About Bitcoin Via Twitter

- Through @AmreekiWitness the defendant discussed methods to provide financial support for those wanting to commit jihad and for those individuals trying to travel overseas.c.

- The defendant tweeted that the khilafah needed an official website "ASAP," and that ISIL could not continue to release media "in the wild" or use "JustPaste."

- Through various tweets, the defendant provided information on how to prevent the website from being taken down, by adding security and defenses, and he solicited others via Twitter to assist on the development of the website.7.

- The defendant used these accounts extensively as a platform to proselytize his radical Islamic ideology, justify and defend ISIL's violent practices, and to provide advice on topics such as jihadists travel to fight with ISIL, online security measures, and about how to use Bitcoin to finance themselves without creating evidence of crime, among other matters.8.

- On this blog, the defendant authored a series of highly-technical articles targeted at aspiring jihadists and ISIL supporters detailing the use of security measures in online communications to include use of encryption and anonymity software, tools and techniques, as well as the use of the virtual currency Bitcoin as a means to anonymously fund ISIL.9.
