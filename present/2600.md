## Google Goes Public with Unpatched Microsoft Edge and IE Vulnerability

- <div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/NewsArticle" class="article_section" readability="75"> <h2 itemprop="headline">Google Goes Public with Unpatched Microsoft Edge and IE Vulnerability</h2>

- <meta itemprop="image" content="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2016/12/14/Edge.jpg"/><p><img alt="Edge" height="460" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2016/12/14/Edge.jpg" width="1250"/></p> <p>Google has gone public with details of a second unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft products, this time in Edge and Internet Explorer, after last week they've published details about a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/after-microsoft-delayed-patch-tuesday-google-discloses-windows-bug/" target="_blank">bug in the Windows GDI</a> (Graphics Device Interface) component.</p> <p>At the time of writing, the bug remains unpatched after Microsoft canceled February's Patch Tuesday security updates, citing a "last minute issue.

- "</p> <h2>Type confusion issue affects Edge and IE</h2> <p>The bug, discovered by Google Project Zero researcher Ivan Fratric, is tracked by the <strong>CVE-2017-0037</strong> identifier and is a type confusion, a kind of security flaw that can allow an attacker to execute code on the affected machine, and take over a device.</p> <p>Details about CVE-2017-0037 are available in <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1011" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google's bug report</a>, along with proof-of-concept code.

- The PoC code causes a crash of the exploited browser, but depending on the attacker's skill level, more dangerous exploits could be built.</p> <p>Fratric found the bug at the end of November and disclosed it today after the 90-day deadline Google provides to affected companies had expired.</p> <h2>The February Patch Tuesday cancellation and its consequences</h2> <p>It is unknown if Microsoft had intended to patch the bug with this month's regular security updates.</p> <p>Besides the Edge and IE bug, Microsoft products are also plagued by two other severe security flaws, one affecting the Windows GDI component and one the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-discloses-windows-zero-day-before-microsoft-can-issue-patch/" target="_blank">SMB file sharing protocol</a> shipped with all Windows OS versions.</p> <p>The good news is that these are just unpatched flaws and not zero-days, as no incidents have been reported as of yet where attackers used any of these three issues.</p> <p>Microsoft said last week it intended to ship the February Patch Tuesday updates <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsofts-february-patch-tuesday-moved-to-march-14/" target="_blank">during March's Patch Tuesday</a>, scheduled for March 15.</p> <p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-patches-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-in-adobe-flash-player/" target="_blank">Microsoft shipped some security updates this week</a>, when it updated the Adobe Flash Player version included with Windows 10.</p>

## Hackers forged login cookies • The Register

- time!</h2><div id="body"><p>Yahoo<i>!</i> is reminding folks that hackers broke into its systems, and learned how to forge its website's session cookies.

- - can lead to people becoming complacent with regards updating login, or worse, simply not bothering to shore up defences.</p><p>"It's essential all Yahoo users roll up their sleeves and continue to use secure passwords and enable two-step verification.

- While this clearly won't save them in all circumstances, it is still certainly better than nothing," he added.</p><p>Tony Pepper, chief exec and co-founder of data security company Egress, said: "Yahoo has clearly been under systematic attack for quite some time and, aside from questions about its historic ability – or lack thereof – to spot breaches, this incident raises a whole host of concerns about the state of data security in general.</p><p>"The fact that the hackers were able to access accounts without the need for passwords is a serious issue.

- Consumers and businesses alike must be encouraged to turn on things like two-factor authentication wherever possible and keep a close eye on their accounts," he added.</p><p>Jason Hart, CTO of data protection at Gemalto, commented: "While it is ‘news’ that Yahoo is making another announcement about a breach, it shouldn’t be surprising.

- Opt-in security is not an option in this day and age.</p><p>"The company recommended that users consider adopting its Yahoo Account Key, an authentication tool that eliminates the need for a password.

## Prisoners innovative antiIMSI catcher defence was er tinfoil

- <h2 class="standfirst">Scottish prison guards left mobile network snooping device in sight of jailbirds</h2><div id="body"><p><strong class="trailer">Exclusive</strong> Prisoners at a Scottish jail evaded an IMSI catcher deployed to collar them making illegal phone calls – by putting up tinfoil after bungling guards left the spy gear visible to inmates.</p><p>“As you are also aware the invisible grabber at HMP Shott <i>[sic]</i> was visible,” Maurice Dickie of the Scottish Prison Service wrote in an internal email of May 2014.</p><p>This referred to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/12/scotland_prison_phone_blocking/">the trial of an IMSI catcher</a> in North Lanarkshire prison HMP Shotts that year.</p><p>The idea was to use the IMSI catcher to find out which prisoners were making illegal calls using smuggled mobile phones from within the jail.

- Officially, the trial was declared a failure, having evidently not caught any lags making unlawful mobile calls, because prisoners were said to have developed “innovative countermeasures”.</p><p><i>The Register</i> understands these "countermeasures" were just tinfoil used to block line of sight to the IMSI catcher after prisoners spotted the device, which appeared to have been placed on the “inside of the prison perimeter”.</p><p>Improperly redacted copies of emails seen by <i>The Reg</i> revealed the cockup.

- UK communications watchdog Ofcom, which regulates the use of IMSI catchers in Blighty, declined to comment.

- The Scottish Prison Service had not responded by the time of publication.</p><p>IMSI catchers are known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/20/us_law_enforcement_100m_on_stingray/">Stingrays in the US</a>.

- In the Shotts case, the IMSI would simply alert guards to the fact that a phone was being used nearby.</p><p>In the UK, new proposals in the Prisons and Courts Bill before Parliament <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/27/prison_courts_bill_imsi_catcher_wireless_interference/">will allow British mobile network operators</a> to deploy them under authorisation from the Justice Secretary.</p><p>Similar authorisations for mobile network snooping, though required by law, are normally given on a blanket basis and for practical purposes do not provide any meaningful safeguard against misuse.

## Google Pulls the Plug On Its Pixel Laptops

- <div id="text-89519629" class="p">

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from Engadget: <i>Although its new flagship phones have been doing brisk sales, Google's high-end, $1,299 Pixel-branded Chromebooks won't be seeing much love from the search giant in the near future.

- <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/google-calls-time-on-the-pixel-laptop/">According to TechCrunch</a>, reporting from the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona today, Google's SVP of hardware Rick Osterloh has announced the second version of the Pixel laptop <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/28/google-no-more-pixel-laptops/">will be the last of its kind</a>.

- As TechCrunch notes, Google is trimming down the Pixel line to just the smartphones and the Pixel C tablet for now.

- Although there may be other devices carrying the name in the future, Osterloh said it was unlikely that its own laptops would be one of them.</i><br/></div>

## How Classical Cryptography Will Survive Quantum Computers

- The N.S.A., for instance, as the Snowden documents revealed, wants to build one for codebreaking, and it seems to be a common belief that if a full-scale, practical quantum computer is built, it could be really useful in that regard.

- This is incredibly useful in modern electronic commerce—if you want to send your credit card number safely over the Internet to Amazon, for instance, you don’t want to have to drive to their headquarters to have a secret meeting first.

- In April 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology followed suit, starting a public vetting process lasting 4 to 6 years.<br/></p> <p>That’s not an unreasonable amount of time to need in order to be sure that a cryptographic method is really secure.

- After several years of study, however, the researchers discovered how to use tools from the field of algebraic number theory to identify a hidden lattice which would reveal the trap door.

- Government agencies are concerned about protecting data that might have to remain secure for decades into the future, so they are preparing now for computers that could still be 10 or 20 years into the future.</p> <p>If you are worried about quantum criminals getting your credit card number off of the Internet, you can breathe a little easier.

## Google quietly launches Meet an enterprisefriendly version of Hangouts

- <!-- Begin: Wordpress Article Content --> <img src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/meet-google-hangouts-ios.png?w=738" class=""/><p>Google has quietly launched a new video conferencing application called <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id1013231476">Meet by Google Hangouts</a>, which is designed for HD video meetings.

- The site resembles the landing page for Hangouts, but without the options to place a phone call or start a text chat.

- You can click a green “join” button to attend a meeting from your phone, which launches the video chat interface.

- Buttons let you mute your call or switch off video.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in large conferences, there’s a main window at the top where you can watch who’s talking, followed by a longer list of participants’ screens, names and emails below.</p><div><div id="adsDivf3635e86a2" class="native-ad-mobile"/></div> <p>Dial-in numbers are available only to G Suite Enterprise Edition customers, but that’s the only limitation noted so far.</p> <p>Google has not yet officially announced Meet’s launch, though it did note <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/29/google-rebrands-its-business-apps-as-g-suite-launches-team-drive-upgrades-apps/">a team-friendly version</a> of Hangouts was in the works back in September.

- It’s unclear if Hangouts will eventually be shuttered, or if it will remain the consumer-facing version of Google’s video chat service.

## BlackBerry Returns With 3 Possible New Phones in 2017 But Do You Care

- The BlackBerry KeyOne, which the company unveiled at MWC, may soon see some siblings.

- From a report on CNET:<i> TCL isn't wasting time building up its portfolio of phones using the BlackBerry name.

- The company plans to release <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/more-blackberry-phones-on-the-way-this-year-scoop-tcl-alcatel-keyone/">as many as three phones this year</a>, TCL Communications Nicolas Zibell said in an interview on Saturday.

- The company is working on an all-touchscreen version, a spiritual successor to the DTEK 50 and DTEK 60 phones, which it also built for BlackBerry itself, according to a source familiar with the rollout plans.

- TCL will likely get rid of the DTEK branding, the source said.</i><br/></div>

## A majority of millennials now reject capitalism poll shows

- Capitalism can mean different things to different people, and the newest generation of voters is frustrated with the status quo, broadly speaking.</p> <p>All the same, that a majority of respondents in Harvard University's survey of young adults said they do not support capitalism suggests that today's youngest voters are more focused on the flaws of free markets.</p> <p>"The word 'capitalism' doesn't mean what it used to," said Zach Lustbader, a senior at Harvard involved in conducting the poll, which was published Monday.

- Only among respondents at least 50 years old was the majority in support of capitalism.</p> <p>Although the results are startling, Harvard's questions accord with other recent research on how Americans think about capitalism and socialism.

- When Republicans — long the champions of free enterprise — use the word "capitalism" these days, it's often to complain about "crony capitalism," he said.</p> <p>"You don't hear people on the right defending their economic policies using that word anymore," Lustbader added.</p> <p>It is an open question whether young people's attitudes on socialism and capitalism show that they are rejecting free markets as a matter of principle or whether those views are simply an expression of broader frustrations with an economy in which household incomes have been declining for 15 years.</p> <p>On specific questions about how best to organize the economy, for example, young people's views seem conflicted.

- "</p> <p>"Young people could be saying that there are problems with capitalism, contradictions," Frank Newport, the editor in chief of Gallup, said when asked about the new data.

- "</p> <p>John Della Volpe, the polling director at Harvard, went on to personally interview a small group of young people about their attitudes toward capitalism to try to learn more.

## Researchers find severe flaw in WordPress plugin with 1 million installs

- <!-- cache hit 542:single/related:d95e360828ac28d82512b9c0ccf34c1c --><!-- empty --><p>More than 1 million websites running the WordPress content management system may be vulnerable to hacks that allow visitors to snatch password data and secret keys out of databases, at least under certain conditions.</p> <p>The vulnerability stems from a "severe" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/how-security-flaws-work-sql-injection/">SQL injection bug</a> in <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/">NextGEN Gallery</a>, a WordPress plugin with more than 1 million installations.

- Until the flaw was recently fixed, NextGEN Gallery allowed input from untrusted visitors to be included in WordPress-prepared SQL queries.

- Under certain conditions, attackers can exploit the weakness to pipe powerful commands to a Web server's backend database.</p> <p>"This is quite a critical issue," Slavco Mihajloski, a researcher with Web security firm Sucuri, wrote in a <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/02/sql-injection-vulnerability-nextgen-gallery-wordpress.html">blog post published Monday</a>.

- Untrusted visitors could achieve this against sites that use the NextGEN Basic TagCloud gallery feature by making slight modifications to the gallery URL.</p> <p>"With this knowledge, an unauthenticated attacker could add extra sprintf/printf directives to the SQL query and use $wpdb-&gt;prepare's behavior to add attacker controlled code to the executed query," Monday's blog post explained.</p> <p>For the attack to work, a website would have to be set up to allow users to submit posts to be reviewed.

- An attacker could create an account on the site and submit a post that contains malformed NextGEN Gallery shortcodes.</p> <p>Mihajloski also described a scenario under which privileged authenticated users could perform the attack.</p> <p>Sucuri has assigned a severity rating of 9 out of a possible 10 points to the vulnerability, which was fixed in version 2.1.79 of the plugin.

## Securing Browsers Through Isolation Versus Mitigation

- I’ve listed the noteworthy ones below, along with comparisons to their analogs in Chrome:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="5cd5" id="5cd5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">MemGC</strong> — MemGC reduces the chances of exploitable use-after-free vulnerabilities by garbage collecting DOM objects and adding some mitigations on the free operation.

- However, it also represents a <a href="https://medium.com/@justin.schuh/stop-buying-bad-security-prescriptions-f18e4f61ba9e" data-href="https://medium.com/@justin.schuh/stop-buying-bad-security-prescriptions-f18e4f61ba9e" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">difference in philosophy</a> and operating constraints, where we’ve observed that isolation appears to be a more effective strategy over the long term, and more portable across the various platforms we must support.</p><p name="1a39" id="1a39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, let’s consider the long term effectiveness of a security mechanism.

- This work relies on features that were added to Windows 10 explicitly for Edge, and in a number of cases are restricted to Microsoft signed binaries.

- Misbehaving third-party applications inject code that not only creates major stability and performance issues, but is a huge obstacle to security.

- I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/justinschuh/status/802492110981058560" data-href="https://twitter.com/justinschuh/status/802492110981058560" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">personally complained</a> about how we’ve been unable to enable Lowbox Tokens (the AppContainer security restriction) and CSRSS restrictions in Chrome’s sandbox, because when we do major third-party antivirus software crashes Chrome.</p><p name="5f69" id="5f69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s good to see that Microsoft made a clean cut with Edge, and has set a precedent of blocking these third-party injections.

## Java and Python FTP Attacks Can Punch Holes Through Firewalls

- "The Java and Python runtimes fail to properly validate FTP URLs, which can potentially allow attackers to punch holes through firewalls to access local networks," reports CSO Online.

- At the same time, he showed that this type of vulnerability can be used to trick the Java runtime to initiate FTP connections to remote servers.

- After seeing Klink's exploit, Timothy Morgan, a researcher with Blindspot Security, decided to <a href="http://blog.blindspotsecurity.com/2017/02/advisory-javapython-ftp-injections.html?m=1">disclose a similar attack</a> that works against both Java's and Python's FTP implementations.

- "But his attack is <a href="http://www.csoonline.com/article/3171153/security/java-and-python-ftp-attacks-can-punch-holes-through-firewalls.html">more serious because it can be used to punch holes through firewalls</a>," writes Lucian Constantin in CSO Online.</i> <br/>"The Java and Python developers have been notified of this problem, but until they fix their FTP client implementations, the researcher advises firewall vendors to disable classic mode FTP translation by default..." reports CSO Online.

- "It turns out that the built-in implementation of the FTP client in Java doesn't filter out special carriage return and line feed characters from URLs and actually interprets them.

## Using Ordered Markov Chains and User Information to speed up Password Cracking

- There is a paper called <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01112124/file/omen.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01112124/file/omen.pdf');">OMEN: Faster Password Guessing Using an Ordered Markov Enumerator</a> that was the inspiration for this post.

- So, lets start.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Using Ordered Markov Chains and User Information to speed up Password Cracking</h2> <h3 style="text-align: center;">Increasing cracking accuracy by 22.5% from John the ripper’s markov and incremental model</h3> <p>After reading the above paper, I wanted a similar tool but the tool made by those guys is not available anywhere.

- It worked because a large number of users use some part of their email or username or any other detail in their password and if we can first check passwords that start with n grams containing usernames portions, user emails portions etc, then we can intuitively speed up the accuracy and the experiments proved this intuition right.

- For privacy reasons, I cannot upload the pruned data of the dumps.</p> <p><strong>Note: </strong>This is by no means a statement that I have broken john the ripper’s speed and accuracy.

- I just think that using user’s social information as n grams with incremental markov models can increase the speed of password cracking to a good extent.

## Whats in your chicken sandwich DNA test shows Subway sandwiches could contain just 50 chicken

- To Mahood, messages from fast food companies can make it sound like "you're taking it straight from a farm and it's just a fresh piece of meat.

- "</p> <h2>What else is in there?</h2> <p>On the whole, <em>Marketplace</em>'s testing revealed that once the ingredients are factored in, the fast food chicken had about a quarter less protein than you would get in its home-cooked equivalent.

- </p> <h2>Healthy alternative?</h2> <p>Nutritionist and registered dietitian Christy Brissette notes that most products in that alphabet soup ingredient list are simply variants on salt or sugar, the latter of which can elevate the carbohydrate level of a chicken breast to well above where it should be: zero per cent.</p>

## Garmin Engineer Shot And Killed By Man Yelling Get Out Of My Country

- Co-worker Alok Madasani was also injured along with bystander Ian Grillot, who attempted to help the men.

- "The suspect in the shooting, Adam Purinton, was drinking at the bar in Olathe, Kansas, at about 7:15 p.m. that night," reports <em>The Verge</em>.

- "A witness said he yelled 'get out of my country' to two of the victims, reportedly saying the men, believed to originally be from India, were 'Middle Eastern.'"

- In 2015, Garmin employed 2,700 workers in Olathe and has plans to double this number, which the article notes has led to "increasing diversity" in the community.</i><br/></div>

## Germany France lobby hard for terrorbusting encryption backdoors  Europe seems to agree

- <h2 class="standfirst">Crypto shouldn't hold back cops, sniffs commission</h2><div id="body"><p>The tech industry has hit back at France and Germany's demands for EU laws requiring secret backdoors in file and communications encryption.</p><p>Last week, Thomas de Maizière and Bruno Le Roux, respectively the German and French ministers of the interior, sent a letter to the European Commission calling for measures to stem what they see as a tide of terrorism sweeping the land.</p><p>These proposed measures include allowing the greater sharing of people's personal information between nations' police forces to fight crime; more reliance on biometrics; and – as is depressingly predictable these days – demands for technology companies to come up with impossible encryption systems that are secure, strong, and yet easily crackable by law enforcement on demand.

- That would allow investigators to decrypt suspects' intercepted messages and seized documents without needing the person's passphrase or private keys.</p><p>The German-French <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/02/28/french_german_eu_letter.pdf">letter</a> [PDF] calls for new legislation implementing these changes to be considered in October, after both countries have had their national elections.</p><p>This isn't the first time the pair have called for such measures, but this time they received support from the European Commission.

- "Encryption technology should not prevent law enforcement agencies or other competent authorities from intervening in the lawful exercise of their functions," an EC spokesman <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.politico.eu/pro/commission-agrees-with-france-and-germanys-counter-terrorism-call/">said</a> in response to the letter, according to Politico.</p><p>The remarks brought a swift bite back from the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, the non-profit think tank that lobbies for the technology industry.

- Christian Borggreen, its director of international policy in Brussels, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ccianet.org/2017/02/is-europe-about-weaken-encryption/">slammed</a> the idea as counterproductive late last week.</p><p>"Any backdoors to encrypted data would pose serious risks to the overall security and confidentiality of Europeans' communications, which seems inconsistent with existing legal protections for personal data," he said.</p><p>"Weakened security ultimately leaves online systems more vulnerable to all types of attacks, from terrorists to hackers.

- Not so – Blighty <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/30/investigatory_powers_act_backdoors/">already has legislation</a> that paves the way for mandatory backdoored encryption, it just hasn't worked out how to force the issue yet.</p><p>As has been pointed out many times, it isn't <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/28/us_politicians_complain_that_silicon_valley_cant_create_encryption_unicorn/">mathematically or technologically possible</a> to build a backdoor into encryption that is completely exclusive to a select set of people, and can't be found and exploited by others.

## ESET antivirus opens Macs to remote execution as root

- We couldn't possibly suggest you attack the latest vulnerability in ESET's antivirus software, because it's too basic to offer any challenge at all.</p><p>As outlined in this <a target="_blank" href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/68">advisory today</a>, all you need to get root-level remote code execution on a Mac is to intercept the ESET antivirus package's connection to its backend servers, put yourself in as a man-in-the-middle, and exploit an XML library hole.</p><p>Or, to use the technically correct language of Google Security Team's Jason Geffner and Jan Bee: “Vulnerable versions of ESET Endpoint Antivirus 6 are statically linked with an outdated XML parsing library and do not perform proper server authentication, allowing for remote unauthenticated attackers to perform arbitrary code execution as root on vulnerable clients.” Lovely.</p><p>The <code>esets_daemon</code> uses an old version of POCO's XML parser library that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow bug, aka <a target="_blank" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0718">CVE-2016-0718</a>, they explain.

- Now the attacker controls the connection, they can send malformed content to to the Mac to hijack the XML parser and execute code as root.</p><p>"When ESET Endpoint Antivirus tries to activate its license, esets_daemon sends a request to https://edf.eset.com/edf," the Googlers explain.</p><p>"The esets_daemon service does not validate the web server's certificate, so a man-in-the-middle can intercept the request and respond using a self-signed HTTPS certificate.

- The esets_daemon service parses the response as an XML document, thereby allowing the attacker to supply malformed content and exploit CVE-2016-0718 to achieve arbitrary code execution as root.

- ®</p><p> <b>Update:</b> </p><p>ESET got in touch with the following statement:</p><p>“Recently, The Google Security Team discovered vulnerabilities in ESET’s consumer and business products for macOS that under some circumstances could allow a user’s machine to be compromised.

- “We’d like to thank Jan Bee and Jason Geffner of The Google Security Team for alerting us and working with us to ensure that our customers would have a repair available prior to public disclosure.” ®</p>    </div>

## Audi Engineer Exposes Cheat Order

- <p>In an interesting turn of events last week in a German court, evidence has materialized that engineers were ordered to cheat emissions testing when developing automotive parts.</p> <p>Last Tuesday, Ulrich Weiß brought forward <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bertelschmitt/2017/02/22/audi-engineer-had-smoking-dieselgate-gun-in-his-safe-pulls-it-in-court/#eca352b2423d" target="_blank">a document that alleges Audi Board of Director members were involved in ordering a cheat</a> for diesel emissions.

- Weiß was the head of engine development for Audi, suspended in November of 2015 but continued to draw more than half a million dollars in salary before being fired <del>after</del> prior to last week’s court testimony.</p> <p>Volkswagen Group is the parent company of Audi and this all seems to have happened while the VW diesel emissions testing scandal <a href="http://hackaday.com/2015/09/23/ethics-in-engineering-volkswagens-diesel-fiasco/">we’ve covered since 2015</a> was beginning to come to light.

- Weiß testified that he was asked to design a method of getting around strict emissions standards in Hong Kong even though Audi knew their diesel engines weren’t capable of doing so legitimately.</p> <p>According to Weiß, he asked for a signed order.

- When he received that order he instructed his team to resist following it.

- We have not seen a copy of the letter, but <a href="http://www.bild.de/geld/wirtschaft/audi/bosse-sollen-diesel-betrug-angeordnet-haben-50538524.bild.html" target="_blank">the German tabloid newspaper Bild reports</a> that the letter claims approval by four Audi board members and was signed by the head of powertrain development at the company.</p> <p>Hackaday was unable to locate any other sources reporting on the letter other than the Bild article we have linked to (also the source used in the Forbes article above).

## Two million recordings of kids parents leaked from cloudconnected toys crappy MongoDB

- And it's all due to the company's poorly secured NoSQL database holding 10GB of this internal information.</p><p>CloudPets' internet-facing MongoDB installation, on port 2701 at 45.79.147.159, required no authentication to access, and was repeatedly extorted by miscreants, evidence shows.

- Copies of data lifted from the CloudPets system has been passed between underground hacking groups, too, apparently.</p><p>Don't forget, anyone else wandering by the database could have swiped the records for themselves and kept quiet, so the information potentially could be in the hands of just about any miscreant.

- The IP belongs to server host Linode, which is presumably providing the machine.</p><p>Computer security breach expert Troy Hunt, who maintains the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/About">HaveIBeenPwned</a> website, was tipped off about the insecurity of CloudPets, a brand of Spiral Toys, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-from-connected-cloudpets-teddy-bears-leaked-and-ransomed-exposing-kids-voice-messages/" rel="nofollow">went public today with details</a> of the cockup.</p><p>“This is kids' voices recorded on teddy bears,” Hunt told <i>The Register</i> after spending a week investigating the security blunder.

- He also warns against buying web-connected toys because it's too easy for a single design error to expose your children to snooping.</p><p>His advice to MongoDB sysadmins is simple: don't accept the default configuration that allows anonymous unauthenticated access, and instead <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/11/mongodb_ransomware_followup/">secure your installation</a>.</p><p>“I can see both sides of this,” Hunt told <i>The Register</i>.

- Spiral claims it learned of the security flaw on February 22; we've been shown evidence that the company was alerted in December, and that it addressed the vulnerabilities in mid-January by removing its MongoDB install from the public internet.

- <h2 class="standfirst">US Cyber Command boss lays out plans for next decade</h2><div id="body"><p>NSA and US Cyber Command boss Mike Rogers has revealed the future direction of his two agencies – and for the private sector, this masterplan can be summarized in one word.</p><p>Kerching!</p><p>Speaking at the West 2017 Navy conference on Friday, Rogers <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1094167/rogers-discusses-near-future-of-us-cyber-command">said</a> he is mulling buying up more infosec tools from corporations to attack and infiltrate computer networks.

- "</p><p>Businesses already flog exploits, security vulnerability details, spyware, and similar stuff to US intelligence agencies, and Rogers is clearly considering stepping that trade up a notch.

- With bounties like that being thrown around, you can bet the biz is charging its bug list subscribers healthy fees – and the US military, with deep pockets, will only be too happy to cough up, if it isn't already.</p><p>"I'm sure US companies are selling weapons to Cyber Command," computer security guru Bruce Schneier told <i>The Register</i>.

- The specifics of the contract weren't released, but the winners were named as The KEYW Corporation; Vencore; Booz Allen Hamilton; Science Applications International Corporation; CACI Federal; and Secure Mission Solutions.</p><h3>Public/private partnerships</h3><p>Bringing the US private sector fully on board doesn't just mean buying from them, but also working with them, Rogers explained.</p><p>When it comes to critical infrastructure, Rogers said that he would like to see US Cyber Command and private IT security employees having "a level of integration where we have actual physical co-location with each other.

- "</p><h3>A few good hackers</h3><p>Rogers said that the training and retention of human talent was going to be essential in the years ahead, and so far Cyber Command isn't having too many problems getting the people it needs, thanks to the unique nature of the job.</p><p>"That's a real selling point for us right now," he said.

## CloudBleed and Coinbase

- <p name="3bcb" id="3bcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Last night, Coinbase became aware of a security bug with CloudFlare, a service Coinbase uses for Denial of Service protection.

- This bug, now commonly known as <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/" data-href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CloudBleed</a>, led to the leak of data from services that use CloudFlare in very specific and relatively rare circumstances.

- We strongly believe that the foundation of trust is transparency, so we want to share a more in-depth analysis of how this event impacts Coinbase and our customers.</p><p name="7973" id="7973" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus far, CloudFlare has identified about 150 CloudFlare customers, including Coinbase, affected by the bug.

- The Coinbase security team will continue to work closely with CloudFlare to determine what, if any, other data may have been exposed by this event.

- </strong>Coinbase’s overall security architecture is designed to minimize the presence of any long term authentication credentials (for risks just like this).

## Ham Goes Nuts for Tiny Transmitter

- <p>What’s the minimal BOM for a working amateur radio transmitter?

- Some get quite complex and support many different modulation schemes, even digital modes.

- With only a single 2N3904 transistor,  [Jarno (PA3DMI)]’s tiny transmitter won’t do much more than send Morse using CW modulation, but given that it’s doing so from inside a walnut shell, we have no complaints.

- The two halves of the shell are hinged together and hold a scrap of perfboard for the simple quartz crystal oscillator.

- The prototype was tuned outside the shell,  and the 9-volt battery is obviously external, but aside from that it’s nothing but nuts.</p> <p>We’d love to see [Jarno] add a spring to the hinge and contacts on the shell halves so no keyer is required.
