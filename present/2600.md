## Open source Roundcube webmail can be attacked ... by sending it an e-mail

- 

- The developers of open source webmail package Roundcube want sysadmins to push in a patch, because a bug in versions prior to 1.2.3 let an attacker crash it remotely  by sending what looks like valid e-mail data. The authors overlooked sanitising the fifth argument (the _from parameter) in mail()  and that meant someone only needed to compose an e-mail with malicious info in that argument to attack Roundcube.  

-  

- It works because of how the program flows in a default installation.

- User input from the Roundcube UI is passed to PHP's mail() function, and mail() calls sendmail. Because the user input wasn't sanitised until the bug-fix, the fifth argument when calling mail() could be used to execute sendmail with the -X option to log all mail traffic  and that, according to RIPS Technologies in this blog post, could be abused to spawn a malicious PHP file in the target server's Webroot directory. After looking over the code and the regex that was meant to sanitise the _from parameter, the RIPS Technologies' analysts worked out that an HTTP request to the server could use that parameter to put a malicious PHP file onto the system, like this:  example@example.com -OQueueDirectory=/tmp -X/var/www/html/rce.php  The malicious rce.php can be populated with PHP code that's inserted in an e-mail's subject line. Since the email data is unencoded, the subject parameter will be reflected in plaintext which allows the injection of PHP tags into the shell file, the post states. Roundcube posted a patch to GitHub at the end of November, and issued a version 1.2.3 here.

## Google Now Lets Developers Write Apps For the Assistant On Google Home

- Google today announced it will open up Home to third-party developers, allowing all developers to start bringing their applications and services to the Google Assistant.

- Developers can start building "conversation actions" for the Google Assistant, which "allows developers to create back-and-forth conversations with users through the Assistant," writes Frederic Lardinois via TechCrunch.

- "Users can simply start these conversations by using a phrase like 'OK Google, talk to Eliza.'"

- TechCrunch reports:  While the Assistant also runs on the Pixel phones and inside the Allo chat app, Google says it plans to bring actions to these other "Assistant surfaces" in the future, but it's unclear when exactly this will happen.

- To help developers who want to build these new Conversation Actions get started, Google has teamed up with a number of partners, including API.AI, GupShup, DashBot and VoiceLabs, Assist, Notify.IO, Witlingo and Spoken Layer.

## Santa says you've been nice kids: OpenVPN to get security audit

- 

- Johns Hopkins University crypto professor Dr Matthew Green is to lead a security audit of OpenVPN 2.4. The open source VPN project, published at GitHub, has been compiled for everything from Solaris to Windows, passing various Linux and BSD distributions along the way (including OSX); Windows and Android (and jailbroken iOSs); and it's baked into firmware implementations like Openwrt, Vyatta, DD-WRT and others.  

-  

- It's also used by VPN provider Private Internet Access, and that's the company that's decided to fund the security review. In this post, PIA's Caleb Chen writes that Dr Green is being paid to review Version 2.4, which is currently in beta, and when that version goes live, the final version will be compared and evaluated to complete the security audit. Chen explains that PIA decided to fund the review itself, rather than crowd-sourcing it, because of the integral nature of OpenVPN to both the privacy community as a whole and our own company. The post says the report will be shared with the OpenVPN community first, before publication, and PIA will help fix any bugs that turn up.

## Don't have a Dirty COW, man: Android gets full kernel hijack patch

- Google has posted an update for Android that, among other fixes, officially closes the Dirty COW vulnerability. The December 2016 update covers a total of 74 CVE-listed security vulnerabilities in Android devices.

- As an aside, Google has also fixed up six security holes present in Android-powered gadgets such as smart locks.

- Again, how these software updates end up being pushed to people's devices is down to the manufacturers. Six of the patches in the batch address elevation of privilege vulnerabilities Google has rated as "critical" security risks as they allow installed applications, or hijacked apps, to take over devices. Also fixed in the December update is CVE-2016-5195, the elevation of privilege flaw known as Dirty COW.

- The programming blunder can be exploited by a malicious installed program to gain root privileges via the copy-on-write mechanism in Android's Linux kernel. The fix for Dirty COW was optional in the November patch batch: Google tagged it as a "supplemental" fix.

- Now, this month, it's in the core set of fixes for everyone to pick up. Dirty COW was found to be in Linux kernel builds as far back as 2007, making the flaw present in not only servers and mobile devices, but in Linux-based appliances and connected devices as well. Meanwhile, as one major Linux kernel hole is fixed, another is being discovered and publicized. CVE-2016-8655 is a privilege escalation flaw that could allow an unprivileged process to gain root-level execution on a local machine. Researchers note that the flaw can be exploited to get total control over Linux distros as well as containers.

## Evernote will let its employees read your notes

-  The change a push by the company to enhance its machine learning capabilities by letting a select number of employees view the private information of its users to help with the training of algorithms.

-  "While our computer systems do a pretty good job, sometimes a limited amount of human review is simply unavoidable in order to make sure everything is working exactly as it should," the company said in a support bulletin.

-   The new privacy policy is something of a bizarre move, considering the recent focus on technology that helps people keep their data private, especially following the U.S. presidential election.

- Bear, a Mac and iOS app that Apple named one of the year's best, can easily import files exported from the service as well.

-  Bear uses Apple's CloudKit to sync user notes, so it's impossible for the app's developers to read the contents of what people have written.

## Op-ed: Im throwing in the towel on PGP, and I work in security

- Filippo Valsorda is an engineer on the Cloudflare Cryptography team, where he's deploying and helping design TLS 1.3, the next revision of the protocol implementing HTTPS.

- I spent days designing my public PGP policy. I traveled two hours by train to meet the closest Biglumber user in Italy to get my first signature in the strong set.

- I get, at most, two encrypted e-mails a year. Then, there's the UX problem: easy crippling mistakes; messy keyserver listings from years ago; "I can't read this e-mail on my phone" or "on the laptop;" "I left the keys I never use on the other machine.

- Such practices actually encourage expanding the attack surface by making backups of the key. We talk about Pets vs. Cattle in infrastructure; those concepts would apply just as well to keys!

- Same for any signed releases or canaries I might maintain in the future. To exchange files, we will negotiate Magic Wormhole, OnionShare, or ad-hoc PGP keys over the secure channel we already have.

## US voting machine certification agency probes potential hack

- The EAC is currently working with Federal law enforcement agencies to investigate the potential breach and its effects. Recorded Future said it latched onto the "hack" after discovering someone offering log-on credentials for access to computers at the US Election Assistance Commission (EAC) during its regular work monitoring underground cyber markets earlier this month.

- In a blog post, the cyber security firm concludes that the hack is more likely the work of an opportunistic criminal hacker rather than state-backed hackers, while adding the caveat that others might have independently discovered and exploited the same vulnerability. Its unclear how long the EAC vulnerability has been active; however, it could have been potentially discovered and accessed by several parties independently.

- Prior to this incident, no previous malicious activity related to EAC has been identified. Third-party security firms warn a hack against the EAC's website could have far-reaching consequences. Nathan Wenzler, principal security architect at AsTech Consulting, said: The recently announced hack and attempted sale of credentials, including administrator accounts according to the reports, belonging to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), is a particularly troubling data breach for an organisation which is mandated to ensure the integrity and security of electronic voting machines. "Perhaps more disturbing is that the hack did not rely on any sophisticated, previously unknown zero-day exploit or a clever bit of social engineering, but rather, the attacker too advantage of a basic SQL injection vulnerability, one of the most common and simplistic vulnerabilities within web applications. SQL injection - one of the most commonplace web application vulnerabilities - creates a mechanism for an attacker to request arbitrary data from a database behind a web application.

- Exploiting SQL injection flaws is a well established hacking technique that can open the door to broader system level access.

- The full extent of the EAC compromise remains unknown. Im not convinced this is a nation state attack, said Chris Roberts, chief security architect at Acalvio.

## Macbook seized or stolen? But you've set a FileVault password, right? Ha, it's useless

- Until earlier this week, Apple's FileVault 2 disk encryption could be defeated in the time it takes to reboot a Mac, given a few hundred dollars in hardware and physical access to the computer. Apple on its website claims that FileVault 2 uses "XTS-AES-128 encryption with a 256-bit key to help prevent unauthorized access to the information on your startup disk.

- However, Ulf Frisk, a security researcher based in Sweden, found that he could plug an assembled device running software called PCILeech into a Mac and obtain the FileVault 2 encryption password using a direct memory access (DMA) attack during the reboot process. Apple's flawed encryption scheme, fixed in the Tuesday release of the macOS 10.12.2 update, lacked protection from DMA attacks launched prior to the the loading of macOS. When running its Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) during the early stages of the boot process, Mac hardware allowed devices connected by Thunderbolt 2 (USB-C has not been tested) to read and write memory in the Mac. The ability to write to memory alone allows an attacker to subvert a system.

- But creating an exploit by overwriting memory wasn't necessary because FileVault passwords were stored in cleartext and were not evicted from memory once the disk was unlocked. Obtaining the disk password was simply a matter of connecting the PCILeech device to a Mac and rebooting it, Frisk explains. "Once the Mac is rebooted, the DMA protections that macOS previously enabled are dropped," said Frisk in a blog post on Thursday.

- " Frisk discovered the vulnerability in July and presented details in August at Def Con 24.

- The presentation also described attacks on Linux and Window systems.  Youtube Video  Apple was subsequently notified and requested that Frisk delay public disclosure until it could deal with the issue, which it has done through its software update. Frisk says it is no longer possible to access memory prior to the boot process on an updated Mac, making it one of the most secure platforms against this specific type of attack, at least with regard to publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.

## Yahoo admits its been hacked again, and 1 billion accounts were exposed

- The breach took place in August 2013 and is apparently distinct from the previous mega-breach revealed this fallone Yahoo claims was conducted by a "state-sponsored actor.

- " The information accessed from potentially exposed accounts "may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (using MD5) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers," Yahoo's chief information security officer, Bob Lord, reported in the statement issued by the company.

- Payment card data and bank account information are not stored in the system the company believes was affected.

- " Yahoo is in the midst of negotiating the details of an acquisition by Verizon, a $4.8 billion deal announced in July.

- Last week, Tim Armstrongthe CEO of AOL, which was previously acquired by Verizonsaid that he was "cautiously optimistic" about the deal being closed soon.

## 'I found a bug that let anyone read anyone's Yahoo! Mail and all I got was this $10k check'

- "The impact of the bug is similar to the one I reported last year, which also brought a $10k bounty," Pynnonen told El Reg.

- The flaw  fixed in production late last month  could be exploited simply by tricking your target into opening a booby-trapped mail.

- The same vulnerability could also be abuse to spread malware, as a blog post by Pynnonen explains: The flaw allowed an attacker to read a victim's email or create a virus infecting Yahoo Mail accounts, among other things.

- No further interaction (such as clicking on a link or opening an attachment) was required. The root cause of the problem was a failure to sanitize user-supplied values in dynamic content.

- It's pretty similar to the stored cross-site scripting vulnerability Pynnonen discovered in the webmail service last year, we're told. For this latest programming blunder, Pynnonen supplied proof-of-concept exploit code to Yahoo!'s security team in the form of an email that, when viewed, would use AJAX to read the user's inbox contents and send it to an attacker's server. A spokesperson for Yahoo! was not available for immediate comment.

## Security! experts! slam! Yahoo! management! for! using! old! crypto!

- " But that the Purple Palace was even using the algorithm has drawn steep criticism from established security boffins. "The MD5 hashing algorithm has been considered not just insecure, but broken, for two decades," says Ty Miller, director of Sydney-based security firm Threat Intelligence, noting that MD5 collision vulnerabilities were found in 1996 with practical attacks developed in 2005. "I consider it negligent of an organisation such as Yahoo!, which has an obligation to protect the private data of over one billion users, to be using such an outdated and ineffective control to protect the passwords of its customers.

- Rainbow tables serve as directories that, effectively, transform hashes into cleartext passwords, and the internet is now littered with free and paid services that can reveal login details within seconds. 

- Any guessable password will have been guessed by now," he says. Not easy Yahoo!, like so many other companies offering free technology services, wants to attract the highest possible number of subscribers and has been criticised for perceived attempts to kneecap fleeing users.

- "And therein lies the problem: there is often a very real tension between the business to be able to claim the highest user count, versus the reality that a years-old email reminds millions of people to log in to an account they had long ago forgotten.

- "The myriad e-commerce shopping cart apps, ad accounts, to say nothing of Flickr, Yahoo! IM, and the hundreds of millions of webmail users who hadn't logged in for years, and you begin to see the scope of the engineering challenge.

## Giving Up on PGP

- Filippo Valsorda wrote an exellent essay on why he's giving up on PGP.

- More generally, e-mail is inherently difficult to secure because of all the different things we ask of it and use it for.

- Valsorda has a different complaint, that its long-term secrets are an unnecessary source of risk:

- The more time passed, the more I would feel uneasy about any specific key.

- Such practices actually encourage expanding the attack surface by making backups of the key.

## Give us encrypted camera storage, please  filmmakers, journos

- Over 150 prominent filmmakers and photojournalists have asked leading camera makers to add support for data encryption to their devices. An open letter published on Wednesday by the Freedom of the Press Foundation  a group that includes Academy Award winners Laura Poitras and Alex Gibney  states that encryption is absent from all commercial cameras being sold today and that the technology is needed to protect both those capturing images and those depicted in them.  

- "Without encryption capabilities, photographs and footage that we take can be examined and searched by the police, military, and border agents in countries where we operate and travel, and the consequences can be dire," the letter states. The list of camera makers contacted includes Canon, Fuji, Nikon, Olympus, and Sony. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the confiscation of cameras from journalists is so common that the organization cannot accurately track such incidents. Mobile phones often have passable cameras and also support the encryption of data at rest, for images and text messaging.

- That makes them safer in theory than professional camera equipment in conflict zones and in confrontations with authorities. Against a well-funded, resourceful, or determined adversary, however, technical protection doesn't guarantee that encrypted data will remain secure. After attempting to pressure Apple into creating a special version of iOS that would allow it to gain access to an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters in 2015, the FBI ultimately gained access to the device with the help of a third party, through what's believed to be software vulnerability. What's more, US Border authorities have broad latitude to search electronic devices, and many countries have laws that can be used to compel individuals to disclose encryption keys.

- So the availability of encryption doesn't mean it will be effective at shielding data from scrutiny. At a recent Hacks/Hackers event in San Francisco titled "Information Security for Journalists," Data Guild cofounder David Gutelius said that, with the possible exception of Signal, he wouldn't recommend any digital communication technology for journalists with serious security concerns involving nation-level adversaries.

- Even Tor, a generally well-regarded network anonymity tool, can be compromised, he said. In an email to The Register, Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, acknowledged that laws limiting encryption and border searches could diminish its effectiveness but emphasized that it should be an option. "Journalists  or anyone who uses a camera with encryption enabled  would always have the option to unlock it if they chose to, but right now they don't even have that choice, and that's the problem," said Timm. Jonathan Zdziarski, an iOS forensic researcher, in a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday voiced support for better encryption and stronger privacy protection but expressed doubt that camera makers, as they lose sales to smartphone makers, see the addition of encryption as a way to revive sales. "Until every journalist learns to encrypt their hard drive and use Signal, I'm not sure an encrypted camera will do them any good," said Zdziarski. And even then, it may not withstand the threat of rubber-hose cryptanalysis or a $5 wrench.

## Kim Dotcom to be extradited to the US, New Zealand judge rules

-   This week, Kim Dotcom tweeted this photo, with the tagline: "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade!

- " American authorities allege that the "Mega Conspiracy...generated more than $175 million in criminal proceeds and caused more than half a billion dollars in harm to copyright owners."

- Authorities seized 18 luxury vehicles and secured NZ$11 million in cash from bank accountsand they grabbed a whopping 150TB of data from Dotcom's many digital devices. "It was definitely not as simple as knocking at the front door," said Detective Inspector Grant Wormald in a police press release at the time. On the day of the raid, American prosecutors unsealed various charges, including criminal charges of copyright infringement, racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering.

- The offenses are spelled out as: Receiving and transporting any money, valuable securities, or other property knowing the same to have been unlawfully obtained. ... Obtaining property, money, or valuable securities by false pretenses or by conspiracy to defraud the public or any person by deceit or falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether such deceit or falsehood or any fraudulent means would or would not amount to a false pretense. However, extradition could be complicated further still if Dotcoma German and Finnish dual citizenbecomes a naturalized New Zealander.

- Under the extradition treaty between the United States and New Zealand, neither country is bound to deliver up its own citizens. Today, Dotcom is only a New Zealand permanent resident, not a citizen, so he is not protected under this clause. But just a few weeks ago, on November 29, 2015, he became eligiblefive years after he became a permanent resident under the country's "Investor Plus" program. Before the ruling was announced, Rothken demurred as to whether Dotcom had already applied to become a New Zealand citizen. "No comment on citizenship issues today while we wait for the district court's decision on extradition," he said by text message. Weeks before the 2012 raid on Megaupload, Dotcom released this song and music video:

## What's new in Tor 0.2.9.8?

-  Today, we've released the first stable version of the 0.2.9.x series, bringing exciting new features to Tor.

- Because this removes the anonymity aspect of the service, we took extra precautions so that it's very difficult to enable a single onion by mistake.

- At midnight UTC every day, directory authorities collectively generate a global random value that cannot be predicted in advance.

- Thanks to atagar, the Stem Library version 1.5.0 supports parsing the shared random values from the consensus.

- Authorities, relays and clients now require ntor keys in all descriptors, for all hops, for all circuits, and for all other roles. In other words, except for onion services (and this will be addressed with the next generation), only ntor is used--now finally dropping the TAP handshake. This results in better security for the overall network and users.  Enjoy this new release!

## All Cyanogen Services Are Shutting Down

- Of course, with no focused team behind the CyanogenMod project it's effectively dead.

- Building an Android OS from scratch is no mean feat and most users won't be able to pull this off, let alone make fixes and updates.

- Cyanogen had already laid off 20% of its workforce in July, and in November announced they had "separated ties" with Cyanogen founder and primary contributor Steve Kondik.

-   UPDATE:  Android Police reports that the CyanogenMod team "has posted an update of their own, confirming the shutdown of the CM infrastructure and  outlining a plan to continue the open-source initiative as Lineage."

- The team posts on their blog that "we the community of developers, designers, device maintainers and translators have taken the steps necessary to produce a fork of the CM source code and pending patches.

## Samy Kamkar Illustrates How to Be a Hardware Hacker

- When thats too small or too slow he grabs a Teensy, and he may reach for an FPGA but only for the rarest of exploits where incredibly fast timing is needed.

- On his workbench youll find a Saleae Logic Analyzer, DMM, Oscilloscope, and your basic soldering kit. Wheres the Skill? So if the tools are simple and widely available, how is it Samy can come up with such amazing hacks?

- This skill is displayed in a trio of very cool hacks he showed off during the talk. CC Spoofing He built his own credit card mag-stripe out of a coil of wire and an ATtiny microcontroller  what he calls MagSpoof.

- He demonstrates dipping a card in iron oxide  the particles stick to the magnetic strip and you can actually read out the data with the naked eye.

- Garage door openers generally have a fixed code (set by DIP switches) that is always broadcast from the remote to the receiver.

## Dropbox Kills Public Folders, Users Rebel

- New submitter rkagerer writes: Dropbox unleashed a tidal wave of user backlash yesterday when it announced plans to eradicate its Public folder feature in 2017.

- joemck explains: "There are countless users who have been using the public folder to post images and files in blogs and forums.

- These aren't just worthless jokes and memes that nobody will miss if you flip the switch and break all of them.

- These are often valuable resources that users have created and entrusted to you to retain and keep online." One user even created a comic strip for the occasion, with another concerned the URL he registered with the Coast Guard containing potentially lifesaving information will go dark.

-  UPDATE 12/17/16: Slashdot reader rkagerer notes, "Dropbox quietly killed the feature request after this story hit the front page, but the original content can still be found interleaved in the forum discussion.

## Obama tosses 35 Russians out of US, sanctions others for election meddling

- " The order is being accompanied by the publication of data from US intelligence communities bolstering findings that the breaches were part of an information operation to manipulate the results of the US presidential election.

- The data, released by the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation as a Joint Analysis Report (JAR), contains "declassified technical information on Russian civilian and military intelligence services malicious cyber activity, to better help network defenders in the United States and abroad identify, detect, and disrupt Russias global campaign of malicious cyber activities," according to an Obama administration statement.

- "The JAR includes information on computers around the world that Russian intelligence services have co-opted without the knowledge of their owners in order to conduct their malicious activity in a way that makes it difficult to trace back to Russia."

- DHS has added these "indicators of compromise" to their Automated Indicator Sharing service. The executive order singles out the GRU (Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate), the FSB (Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB), Esage Lab (a Web development arm of the Russian information security company Zorsecurity), the St. Petersburg-based firm Special Technology Center, and Russia's Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems.

- It also names four individuals: GRU chief General-Lieutenant Igor Korobov, GRU Deputy Chief and Head of Signals Intelligence Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov, and GRU First Deputy Chiefs Igor Olegovich Kostyukov and Vladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev. The 35 Russians ejected from the USindividuals identified as intelligence operatives working out of the Russian embassy in Washington and Russia's consulate in San Franciscowere ejected not in response to the DNC and Clinton campaign hacks, but in response to "harassment of our diplomatic personnel in Russia by security personnel and police," according to a White House fact sheet issued on the executive order. In addition to those explicitly named by the order, Obama's order applies to: ...any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, directly or indirectly, cyberenabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States that are reasonably likely to result in, or have materially contributed to, a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States and that have the purpose or effect of ... tampering with, altering, or causing a misappropriation of information with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions. That could, if pressed aggressively, apply to a very large swath of individuals, including operators of "fake news" sites and others involved tangentially in the distribution of information that may be seen as intended to interfere with electionsincluding the still-unidentified individuals involved in hacking two state election commission websites.

## Kiev Power Outage Linked To Cyber Attacks

- As a result, houses and flats of the right bank district of Kiev* and neighbouring areas lost power. Ukrenergo, a Ukrainian energy provider, said that hacker attack and equipment failure are among the possible causes for the power failures, according to local reports. Moreno Carullo, co-founder and chief technical officer at Nozomi Networks, said, These reports are reminiscent of an attack experienced at a similar time last December that left 225,000 Ukrainians cold at Christmas.

- Worryingly, if this does prove to be another cyberattack on the Ukrainian grid, it sets an uncomfortable precedent that similar attacks may occur annually at this time of year. The recent outage appears to centre at a transmission substation.

- Sadly when such things happen security is rarely a concern or even something discussed. If they connect their remote control software, it works  and thats usually the end of that. Substations have long been considered a weak point, with respect to cybersecurity, due to their remote location making them difficult to manage and monitor for disruptions.

- If hackers did attack Kievs power grid  something thats still the subject of investigation  then Russia will almost inevitably become the chief suspect, given recent (unresolved) conflicts between the two countries. Alex Mathews, lead security evangelist at Positive Technologies, remains unconvinced that hackers caused the latest power outage in the Ukraine.

- Such power outages happen every year, even in big cities like Moscow, Petersburg and Kiev. The temperature in Kiev on the day ranged from a -1 C maximum and a -9 C minimum. Lets hope this isnt a trend and citizens of Ukraine can avoid getting a nasty shock like this each December in the coldest period of the year. You also cant rule out nation-state attacks just testing the resources and reaction times of Ukraine (possibly Russian?

## Google Releases Tool To Find Common Crypto Bugs

- The tests are called Project Wycheproof, and Google's engineers designed them to help developers implement crypto libraries without having to become experts.

- Attackers often will look for weak crypto implementations as a means of circumventing strong encryption in a target app.

- Among the issues that Google's engineers found with the Project Wycheproof tests is one in ECDH that allows an attacker to recover the private key in some circumstances.

- The bug is the result of some libraries not checking the elliptic curve points that they get from outside sources. "In cryptography, subtle mistakes can have catastrophic consequences, and mistakes in open source cryptographic software libraries repeat too often and remain undiscovered for too long.

- We recognize that software engineers fix and prevent bugs with unit testing, and we found that many cryptographic issues can be resolved by the same means," Daniel Bleichenbacher and Thai Duong, security engineers at Google, said in a post announcing the tool release.

## Amazon Patents Floating Airship Warehouse For Its Delivery Drones

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: We've known about Amazon's drone delivery ambitions since 2013.

- The airborne fulfillment centers, or AFCs, would be stocked with a certain amount of inventory and positioned near a location where Amazon predicts demand for certain items will soon spike.

- If there's a big championship game down below, Amazon AFC's above could be loaded with snacks and souvenirs sports fans crave.

- The AFCs could be flown close to a stadium to deliver audio or outdoor display advertising near the main event, as well, the filing suggested.

- The filing also reveals that the shuttles and drones, as they fly deliveries around, could function in a mesh network, relaying data to each other about weather, wind speed and routing, for example, or beaming e-book content down to readers on the ground. Amazon also recently patented a system to defend its drones against hackers, jammers and bows and arrows.

## In Canada 50Mbps internet now considered a basic service

- (Fred Chartrand/Canadian Press)               Today's decision could pave the way for universal access to high-speed service in remote, rural areas The CRTC has declared broadband internet a basic telecommunications service. In a ruling handed down Wednesday, the national regulator ordered the country's internet providers to begin working toward boosting internet service and speeds in rural and isolated areas. "The future of our economy, our prosperity and our society  indeed, the future of every citizen  requires us to set ambitious goals, and to get on with connecting all Canadians for the 21st century," said Jean-Pierre Blais, the CRTC's chair, at a news conference in Gatineau, Que. "Today's decision signals a fundamental shift in our regulations for basic services from voice-related issues to broadband-related issues.

- The ruling identifies LTE as the service standard. Geographic access but not price The regulator has not intervened directly to make internet cheaper.

- However, in response to a query from CBC News on Thursday, the company clarified the "20 times faster" speeds refers to a service offered in areas covered by its cable network. "While there are still many details to be worked out, we are encouraged by this reasonable plan to help increase access to Canadians in hard to reach areas of our country," said David Watt, Rogers' senior vice-president of regulatory affairs. Federal government funds high-speed Last week, the federal government announced it would be investing up to $500 million to bring high-speed, broadband internet access to 300 rural and remote communities by 2021. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said the Connect to Innovate program is the modern equivalent of building roads or railway spurs to remote locations, providing internet access to schools, homes and First Nations band offices. That funding was separate from the CRTC announcement, but the two programs can work together in that a company could dip into both funds. Carleton University professor Dwayne Winseck participated in the CRTC's hearings and attended today's announcement. "I think the whole idea of just formally including broadband internet into the concept of basic service is a really important milestone for us to have passed," Winseck said.

-  Winseck said a more direct regulatory intervention on retail price has become "anathema" in the last 20 years. OpenMedia, an advocacy group that participated in the CRTC process, issued a statement declaring victory over the "basic service" designation.

- Now that the CRTC has spoken, we need to hold the Trudeau government accountable for ensuring this exciting vision becomes a reality.

## Practical Deep Learning

-  Deep Learning  the use of neural networks with modern techniques to tackle problems ranging from computer vision to speech recognition and synthesis  is certainly a current buzzword.

- Multi-layer neural networks arent new, but there is a resurgence of interest primarily due to the availability of massively parallel computation platforms disguised as video cards. The problem is getting started in something like this.

- Or you can grab some code from GitHub and try to puzzle it out. A better idea would be to take a free class entitled: Practical Deep Learning for Coders, Part 1.

- You will start with step onelearning how to get a GPU server online suitable for deep learningand go all the way through to creating state of the art, highly practical, models for computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. Lesson 1 covers distinguishing cats from dogs.

- According to the site, it should be available online in May of 2017. We recently talked about simple neural networks.

## MormonWikileaks website launched, seeking transparency in LDS Church

-    SALT LAKE CITY  A new online venue has launched, targeting what happens behind the scenes at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

- The goal of the website is simply to promote transparency within the LDS church, said Ryan McKnight, Founder of MormonWikileaks.com. On Monday, he published four internal church documents: a memo to the Executive Director of the Temple Department about unauthorized photos and videos of temples online, an organizational chart for the Intellectual Property Division, a memo regarding the operation and procedures of the Correlation Committee and a memo reminding local leaders to get consent before disclosing details of Church welfare assistance members have received unless a subpoena has been issued. If it has to do with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles or the First Presidency, chances are thats going to be put out because theyre public figures and they have a responsibility to their members, said McKnight. McKnight admits nothing currently on the site is a "bombshell" and he said it should not be seen in a negative light.

- Already, he said, two different people working at the church have offered him tithing records of famous Mormons.

- The example he gave is BYU and NFL great Steve Young. In October, McKnight made headlines when he released a series of leaked videos on his youtube channel Mormonleaks.

- Ironically, the one that has drawn the most views (over 30,000), features a presenter warning church leaders about cyber security. Could Wikileaks or a group like wikileaks embarrass or damage the church, the presenter is heard saying in the video. During the discussion with the presenter, Elder Dallin H. Oaks, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, made a comment sparking dozens of online comments. Im suspicious that the news media cover up anything involving homosexuals when it would work to the disadvantage of the homosexual agenda, said Oaks. The comment, McKnight said, is the kind of thing Mormonwikileaks seeks to expose. The rhetoric that we heard them spout in that video was very different from their current rhetoric they are presenting to the public, said McKnight. The church declined to comment for this story.

## 33C3: If You Cant Trust Your Computer, Who Can You Trust?

-  Its a sign of the times: the first day of the 33rd Chaos Communications Congress (33C3) included two talks related to assuring that your own computer wasnt being turned against you.

- The two talks are respectively practical and idealistic, realizable today and a work thats still in the idea stage. In the first talk, [Trammell Hudson] presented his Heads open-source firmware bootloader and minimal Linux for laptops and servers.

- [Trammell]s Heads distribution is a collection of the best tools currently available, and its something you can do now, although its not going to be easy. Carrying out the ideas fleshed out in the second talk is even harder  in fact, impossible at the moment.

- Non-open blobs of firmware abound, and if youre really concerned with the privacy of your communications, you dont want the CPU (or Intels management engine) to get its hands on your plaintext. [Jaseg]s solution is to interpose a device, probably made with a reasonably powerful FPGA and running open-source, inspectable code, between the CPU and the screen and keyboard.

- But the idea is very interesting, and places the trust boundary about as close to the user as possible, at input and output.

## 33C3: Chris Gerlinsky Cracks Pay TV

-  People who have incredible competence in a wide range of fields are rare, and it can appear deceptively simple when they present their work.

- [Chris Gerlinksy]s talk on breaking the encryption used on satellite and cable pay TV set-top boxes was like that.

- The end result of his work is that he gets to watch anything on pay TV, but getting to watch free wrestling matches is hardly the point of an epic hack like this. The talk spans hardware reverse engineering of the set-top box itself, chip decapping, visual ROM recovery, software reverse analysis, chip glitching, creation of custom glitching hardware, several levels of crypto, and a lot of very educated guessing.

- Watch this talk now. Some of the coolest bits:  Reading out the masked ROM from looking at it with a microscope never fails to amaze us. A custom chip-glitcher rig was built, and is shown in a few iterations, finally ending up in a fancy project box.

- But its the kind of thing you could build at home: a microcontroller controlling a switch on a breadboard. The encoder chip stores its memory in RAM: [Chris] uses a beautiful home-brew method of desoldering the power pins, connecting them up to a battery, and desoldering the chip from the board for further analysis. The chip runs entirely in RAM, forcing [Chris] to re-glitch the chip and insert his payload code every time it resets.

## 33C3: Understanding Mobile Messaging and its Security

- Does she even care about forward secrecy or the difference between a private and public key is?

- Maybe she would if she understood the issues in relation to normal human experiences: holding secret discussions behind closed doors and sending letters wrapped in envelopes. Or maybe your grandmother is the type whod like to completely re-implement the messaging service herself, open source and verifiably secure.

- Whichever grandma youve got, she should watch [Roland Schilling] and [Frieder Steinmetz]s talk where they give both a great introduction into what you might want out of a secure messaging system, and then review what they found while tearing apart Threema, a mobile messaging service thats popular in Germany.

- The messaging service is always in the middle of a discussion, and whether theyre collecting metadata about you and your conversations to use for their own marketing purposes (Hiya, Whatsapp!) or not, its good to see how a counterexample could function. The best quote from the talk?

- But these details matter, and as mobile messaging is a part of everyday life, its important that the workings are transparently presented to the users.

## 33C3 Starts Tomorrow: We Wont Be Sleeping for Four Days

-  Possibly the greatest hacker show on Earth, the 33rd annual Chaos Communication Congress (33C3) begins Tuesday morning in Hamburg, Germany.

- There will be live streaming, and the talks are usually available in preliminary edit for viewing or download just a few minutes after they finish.

- Every hackerspace with a video projector could be playing along, live or after the fact.

- in person, or even just say Hi, well be wandering around from talk to talk and session to session just like you, only with a backpack full of Hackaday stickers. If theres anything you think we should see, post up in the comments.

- If theres enough call for it, well have a Hackaday meetup once we can figure out a good time and location.

## 33C3: Breaking IoT Locks

-  Fast-forward to the end of the talk, and youll hear someone in the audience ask [Ray] Are there any Bluetooth locks that you can recommend? and he gets to answer nope, not really. (If this counts as a spoiler for a talk about the security of three IoT locks at a hacker conference, you need to get out more.

- The promise of Internet-enabled locks is that they can allow people one-time use or limited access to physical spaces, as easily as sending them an e-mail.

- Lock making goes from being a skill that involves clever mechanical design and metallurgy, to encryption and secure protocols. In this fun talk, [Ray] looks at three IoT locks.

- One, he throws out on mechanical grounds once hes gotten it open  its a $100 lock thats as easily shimmable as that $4 padlock on your gym locker.

- The third, made by Kickstarter company Noke, was at least physically secure, but fell prey to an insecure key exchange protocol. Along the way, youll get some advice on how to quickly and easily audit your own IoT devices.

## Millions of Websites Vulnerable Due To Security Bug In Popular PHP Script

- A security flaw discovered in a common PHP class allows knowledgeable attackers to execute code on a website that uses a vulnerable version of the script, which in turn can allow an attacker to take control over the underlying server

- The vulnerable library is PHPMailer, a PHP script that allows developers to automate the task of sending emails using PHP code, also included with WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and more. The vulnerability was fixed on Christmas with the release of PHPMailer version 5.2.18

- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration released its recommendations for how medical device manufacturers should maintain the security of internet-connected devices

- The 30-page document (PDF) encourages manufacturers to monitor their medical devices and associated software for bugs, and patch any problems that occur

- But the recommendations are not legally enforceable

## Panasonic's in-flight entertainment systems have critical security flaws

- Theres no generic response to this, but let's try to dissect some potential general case scenarios by introducing some additional context (nonspecific to a particular company or system unless stated).

-  Relying exclusively on the DO-178B standard that defines Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, the IFE would technically lie within the D and E levels.

- Panasonic Avionics IFE in particular is certified at Level E. This basically means that even if the entire system fails, the impact would be something between no effect at all and passenger discomfort.

-  The DIY Feminist Guide to Cybersecurity, available in Spanish and English, is designed to be a quickstart for gendered, racialized, queerphobic, transphobic, ableist, and classist threats to digital autonomy, created because companies and developers frequently ignore or underestimate the digital threats to these spaces and their users.

## Thailand's military-appointed Assembly unanimously passes an internet law combining the world's worst laws

-   Even though the law is not yet in effect, authorities are already aggressively blocking harmful Internet content, especially those deemed to be disrespectful to the monarchy.

- Thailand implements a strict lese majeste (anti-royal insult) law which some activists believe is being abused by the junta to harass and detain its critics.

- Some businesses also welcomed the passage of the law which they believe will protect intellectual property rights and spur the development of the digital economy.

-  Execs representing the biggest tech companies in America are gathering for a meeting with Donald Trump tomorrow in New York; these companies have it in their power to spy on us, locate us, censor us, and terminally compromise the free and open internet. READ THE REST

## Fancy Bear ramping up infowar against Germanyand rest of West

- But the US is not the only country that the Russian government has apparently targeted for these sorts of operationsand the methods used in the DNC hack are being applied increasingly in attempts to influence German politics, Germany's chief of domestic intelligence warned yesterday.

- In addition to propaganda and disinformation campaigns launched through social media, the BfV noted an increased number of "spear phishing attacks against German political parties and parliamentary groups" using the same sort of malware used against the Democratic National Committee in the US. The statement from the BfV came on the same day that Alex Younger, the chief of the United Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) made more veiled references to disinformation and hacking campaigns.

- He added that the way people use social media to obtain news was aiding disinformation campaigns. "We are concerned that echo chambers are emerging that make the formation of domestic political opinions highly vulnerable to automated opinion-shaping," Maassen warned. The campaign includes the "enormous use of financial resources" to fund disinformation campaigns, the BfV reported.

- In 2015, APT 28 "successfully exfiltrated data from the German Bundestag," Germany's parliament, the BfV release noted.

- Russia is generally believed to have been behind cyber-attacks and propaganda operations against Estonia and Ukraine, among other former Soviet states, and has reportedly been behind similar operations in Poland. Given the effect that the DNC hack and other information warfare had in the USnot necessarily influencing the final results, but creating the impression that Russia could directly interfere in US politicsEstonian Foreign Minister Sven Mikser told Reuters at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on December 8, "It's a pretty safe bet that they will try to do it again, and they will try to surprise us.

## This low-cost device may be the worlds best hope against account takeovers

- A growing consensus has emerged among security practitioners: even long, randomly generated passwords aren't sufficient for locking down e-mail and other types of online assets.

- According to the consensus, these assets need to be augmented with a second factor of authentication. Now, a two-year study of more than 50,000 Google employees concludes that cryptographically based Security Keys beat out smartphones and most other forms of two-factor verification. The Security Keys are based on Universal Second Factor, an open standard that's easy for end users to use and straightforward for engineers to stitch into hardware and websites.

- Using phones to receive one-time passwords through SMS text-messaging is especially risky because, in addition to all of the risks listed above, there's the threat the messages could be intercepted.

- They're smaller than a door key, plug into a computer's USB slot, and require no batteries. Following the compromise of Hillary Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta's Gmail account through a simple phishing ploy, a growing number of people have realized the crucial importance of two-factor authentication.

- While there are a variety of ways to put it into place, the research paper makes a convincing case that Security Keys based on the U2F standard are the best approach.

## A flight was late because someone named their Wi-Fi hotspot Galaxy Note 7

- A clever but highly irresponsible troll by a passenger aboard a Virgin America flight out of San Francisco nearly resulted in the plane being grounded and searched for the recalled smartphone.

- According to BBC News, someone switched the name of their portable Wi-Fi hotspot to Galaxy Note 7_1097, which gave other passengers (and the flights crew) the impression that Samsungs device was somewhere on the plane  and actively being used.

- The captain warned that the flight would need to be diverted and land in Wyoming (far from its Boston destination) for an emergency search if no one stepped forward.

-  Remember that the Galaxy Note 7 is a potential fire hazard and is officially barred from flight by the FAA.

- The culprit ultimately fessed up and explained the stubborn prank. iMores Serenity Caldwell was at the airport a few hours after the flight arrived in Boston  late.

## Evolution Made Really Smart People Long to Be Loners

- And, for most people, frequent contact with good friends makes us feel content.That is, unless youre really, really smart.In a paper published in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers Norman Li and Satoshi Kanazawa report that highly intelligent people experience lower life satisfaction when they socialize with friends more frequently.

- The savanna theory of happiness is the idea that life satisfaction is not only determined by whats happening in the present but also influenced by the ways our ancestors may have reacted to the event.

- Evolutionary psychology argues that, just like any other organ, the human brain has been designed for and adapted to the conditions of an ancestral environment.

- Therefore, the researchers argue, our brains may have trouble comprehending and dealing with situations that are unique to the present.The two factors that differ the most between ancestral and modern life are population density and how frequently humans socialize with friends.

- Densely packed urban centers, in contrast, are thought to bring about isolation and depression because they do not foster close relationships.

## Ethereum.org Forums Database Compromised

-  On December 16, we were made aware that someone had recently gained unauthorized access to a database from forum.ethereum.org.

- We immediately launched a thorough investigation to determine the origin, nature, and scope of this incident.

- Here is what we know:  The information that was recently accessed is a database backup from April 2016 and contained information about 16.5k forum users. The leaked information includes  Messages, both public and private IP-addresses Username and email addresses Profile information Hashed passwords  ~13k bcrypt hashes (salted) ~1.5k WordPress-hashes (salted) ~2k accounts without passwords (used federated login)     The attacker self-disclosed that they are the same person/persons who recently hacked Bo Shen. The attacker used social engineering to gain access to a mobile phone number that allowed them to gain access to other accounts, one of which had access to an old database backup from the forum.  We are taking the following steps:  Forum users whose information may have been compromised by the leak will be receiving an email with additional information. We have closed the unauthorized access points involved in the leak. We are enforcing stricter security guidelines internally such as removing the recovery phone numbers from accounts and using encryption for sensitive data. We are providing the email addresses that we believe were leaked to https://haveibeenpwned.com, a service that helps communicate with affected users. We are resetting all forum passwords, effective immediately.  If you were affected by the attack we recommend you do the following:  Ensure that your passwords are not reused between services.

- If you have reused your forum.ethereum.org password elsewhere, change it in those places.  Additionally, we recommend this excellent blog post by Kraken that provides useful information about how to protect against these types of attacks. We deeply regret that this incident occurred and are working diligently internally, as well as with external partners to address the incident. Questions can be directed to security@ethereum.org.

## True cost of recruiting a developer [infographic]

- Are you sure your employees wont quit on you?  Feel free to share this infographic on your site, but please mention the article below, where all the data is explained.

- That, in turn, means a significant loss of revenue and productivity. Cost-per-hire  The amount spent on recruiting a new programmer varies depending on; the skills, position type, level, market demand, geographic region and so on.

- Apart from checking the most popular social media such as Facebook or Twitter, focus on tech forums and communities with GitHub or StackOverflow for a starter.

- Productivity loss may reach $34 000. Other costs include salary and benefits which may be crucial for your new programmer and help you win the best candidates.

- These figures are the sums of the external and internal costs which are partly described above. Moreover, as a company youll suffer productivity loss in this case totalling $33,251 or you will get the contractor cover which costs you $22,167. You have to take into account also management time spent on the recruitment process, reviewing CVs, interviewing and repeating the process if the job offer gets rejected.

## A Ham Radio Software Company Has Been Blacklisting Users For Leaving Negative Reviews

- Gandalf_the_Beardy quotes a report from The Register: The Register reports on the story of Jim Giercyk, an amateur radio enthusiast who had his copy of the popular Ham Radio Deluxe (HRD) software revoked after posting a negative review.

- Other radio hams have followed up with us regarding claims that this was not an isolated incident and others may have had their license keys blacklisted for being publicly critical of the company.

- Giercyk also said that since he went public about his blacklisting last week, he has received messages from other users who have stories of their software keys being revoked by HRD without their knowledge for speaking up about having a bad support experience.

- A number of other readers pointed out a collection of bad reviews posted on hobbyist site eHam by customers who had their license keys blacklisted.

- HRD told us some of those users could have written their assessments after requesting a refund and deactivating their software, thus their licenses will appear revoked.

## A Single Text Can Disable iOS Messages Forever

- new exploit will permanently disable the Messages app. So prepare to be wary of any text your asshole friends and colleagues send your way.

- vincedes3 created a ridiculously complex vCard, a type of virtual business card you use to share contacts on your phone

- vincedes3's vCard has 14,281 lines of code where the average vCard has just around 200-300. When Messages attempts to open the card it crashes

- Restarting the phone or the app doesnt work because, in an effort to be super helpful, Messages always tries to open the most recent text. It puts Messages into a vicious and inescapable loop

## Snowden Doc Shows NSA Blamed Russia For Hack of Murdered Journalist

- The National Security Agency (NSA) knew that the Russian government hacked the email account of a prominent journalist the year before she was killed in Moscow, documents published by The Intercept show

- The 2006 murder of longtime Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya -- who was gunned down in the elevator of her apartment complex -- is widely believed to have been a contract killing

- Politkovskaya was a noted critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and it has long been suspected that the murder was carried out on his orders

- From a report: The NSA compiled an internal file on Politkovskaya, which was exposed as part of the Edward Snowden leaks

- Much of the document is unclassified and public, except for one top-secret segment: "Russian Federal Intelligence Services (probably FSB) are known to have targeted the webmail account of the murdered Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya

- On 5 December 2005, RFIS initiated an attack against the account annapolitkovskaia@US Provider1, deploying malicious software which is not available in the public domain. It is not known whether this attack is in any way associated with the death of the journalist."

## Talking Behind Your Back

-  On the Privacy  Security of the Ultrasound Tracking Ecosystem  

- To meet these demands, a new ultrasound-based technology has recently emerged and is already utilized in a number of different real-world applications.

- Ultrasound tracking comes with a number of desirable features (e.g., easy to deploy, inaudible to humans), but alarmingly until now no comprehensive security analysis of the technology has been conducted.

- Subsequently, we will introduce some immediately deployable defense mechanisms for practitioners, researchers, and everyday users.

- Finally, we will initiate the discussion for the standardization of ultrasound beacons, and outline our proposed OS-level API that enables both secure and effortless deployment for ultrasound-enabled applications.

## 33C3 talk on dissecting cellular modems

-  Yesterday, together with Holger 'zecke' Freyther, I co-presented at 33C3 about Dissectiong modern (3G/4G) cellular modems. This presentation covers some of our recent explorations into a specific type of 3G/4G cellular modems, which next to the regular modem/baseband processor also contain a Cortex-A5 core that (unexpectedly) runs Linux. We want to use such modems for building self-contained M2M devices that run the entire application inside the modem itself, without any external needs except electrical power, SIM card and antenna. Next to that, they also pose an ideal platform for testing the Osmocom network-side projects for running GSM, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS and HSPA cellular networks. You can find the Slides and the Video recordings in case you're interested in more details about our work. The results of our reverse engineering can be found in the wiki at http://osmocom.org/projects/quectel-modems/wiki  together with links to the various git repositories containing related tools. As with all the many projects that I happen to end up doing, it would be great to get more people contributing to them.

- If you're interested in cellular technology and want to help out, feel free to register at the osmocom.org site and start adding/updating/correcting information to the wiki. You can e.g. help by  playing with the modem and documenting your findings reviewing the source code released by Qualcomm + Quectel and documenting your findings help us to create a working OE build with our own kernel and rootfs images as well as opkg package feeds for the modems help reverse engineering DIAG and QMI protocols as well as the open source programs to interact with them

## Wycheproof  Test Crypto Libraries Against Known Attacks

-  Project Wycheproof is a tool to test crypto libraries against known attacks.

- It is developed and maintained by members of Google Security Team, but it is not an official Google product.  At Google, they rely on many third party cryptographic software libraries.

- Unfortunately, in cryptography, subtle mistakes can have catastrophic consequences, and they found that libraries fall into such implementation pitfalls much too often and for much too long. Good implementation guidelines, however, are hard to come by: understanding how to implement cryptography securely requires digesting decades worth of academic literature. They recognise that software engineers fix and prevent bugs with unit testing, and they also found that cryptographic loopholes can be resolved by the same means. 

-  These observations have prompted them to develop Project Wycheproof, a collection of unit tests that detect known weaknesses or check for expected behaviours of some cryptographic algorithm.

- Project Wycheproof provides tests for most cryptographic algorithms, including RSA, elliptic curve crypto and authenticated encryption. Features Project Wycheproof has tests for the most popular crypto algorithms, including  AES-EAX AES-GCM DH DHIES DSA ECDH ECDSA ECIES RSA  The tests detect whether a library is vulnerable to many attacks, including:  Invalid curve attacks Biased nonces in digital signature schemes Of course, all Bleichenbachers attacks And many more  there are over 80 test cases  You can download Project Wychproof here: wycheproof-master.zip Or read more here.

## Trump expresses doubts about security of all computers

- You know, if you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way. Because Ill tell you what: No computer is safe, Trump told reporters during his annual New Years Eve bash. I dont care what they say.

- I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove, so it could be somebody else, he said.

- He added, cryptically, that he also knows things that other people dont know. And so they cannot be sure of the situation.

## Self-driving cars will exacerbate organ shortages

- An estimated 94 percent of motor-vehicle accidents involve some kind of a driver error. As the number of vehicles with human operators falls, so too will the preventable fatalities.

- Though advocates may be concerned about the inequities organ markets may create, it bears noting that our current donation system already disproportionately favors the wealthy.

- Richer patients can also afford to travel to countries with more prevalent black markets for organs (which, unregulated, may have meant darker outcomes for their original owners).

- In that time, as lower-level autonomous vehicles are deployed, policymakers could develop and refine legal protections for organ donors, with state-by-state standards to accommodate different levels of comfort.

- To alleviate concerns associated with commercialization, compensation could be limited to fixed payments or to benefit packages that include insurance, tax deductions for travel, lodging and lost wages, or paid donor leave.
