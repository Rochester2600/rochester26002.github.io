## Silk Road trial closes: Its a hacker! Its a virus! Its ludicrous.

- A federal jury saw a final clash between prosecutors and lawyers for Ross Ulbricht on Tuesday as the Silk Road drug-trafficking trial sped to a close.

- suggested again that Ulbricht left the site behind but came back

- Ulbrichts own lawyer admitted during opening statements that his client created the site. Theres no dispute it was used to sell drugs, said Turner. Theres no dispute when the defendant was arrested, he was logged in as Dread Pirate Roberts.

- bookkeeping spreadsheets. The to-do lists. The weekly reports. The maintenance logs. The chatsmore than 1,000 pages of chats with Variety Jones, his hacker-mentor.

- Dread Pirate Roberts and Ulbricht cant be the same person, in part because Ulbricht just didnt have the sophistication and cunning that DPR exhibited, said Dratel.

- An entire copy of the Silk Road site was found, encrypted, on a thumb drive on Ulbrichts bedside table. Would Dread Pirate Roberts do that? he asked.

- Would DPR have saved his chats? Even Ulbrichts position in the library, with his back to the door, was a move Dread Pirate Roberts wouldnt have made, said Dratel.

- Keeping a journal like that? he asked. Does that sound like DPR? Its a little too convenient. Its like a virtuoso piano player who cant play Happy Birthday. It doesnt fit.

## Silk Road Case: Prosecution Reads Alleged Transcript of DPR Arranging 5 Murders

- The prosecution has now rested its case

- ne of their last presentations was a series of communications between DPR and a supposed member of the Hell's Angels motorcycle club

- he arranged for hitmen to kill five different people.

- Dread Pirate Roberts, hasn't been charged with murder-for-hire in his Southern District of New York case

- He does, however, face murder-for-hire charges in a separate case in Baltimore

- members of the Hell's Angels organization are familiar with using encryption to shield their communications from law enforcement

## [ooni-dev] Timeline of Tor blocking

- Tor's site was blocked in Turkey in March 2014: http://cartography.io/

- "Iran  2013  TCP reset on all non-HTTP"

- a traffic shaping behavior that matched TCP connections
against a whitelist (HTTP or HTTPS)

- if the connection did not match this
behavior, then the throughput was throttled down to 1 packet per second
after sixty seconds

- Psiphon's bypass mechanism was to prepend "GET /
HTTP1.0" in front of traffic streams.

## Five technologies that betrayed Silk Road's anonymity

- 1. Bitcoin: If you assume your bitcoins cant be traced back to you, think again.

- 2. Chat logs: So much chatter. Thousands of pages of chat logs helped prosecutors trace the growth of Silk Road

- 3. Encryption: Encryption puts a digital padlock on information so it cant be viewed. But eventually the person with the keys has to unlock the information in order to see it. Thats why law enforcement agents had to catch Ulbricht while he was logged into the SIlk Roads admin console

## Patch now: Design flaw in Windows security allows hackers to own corporate laptops, PCs

- a flaw in the fundamental design of Windows thats taken a year to correct, and is unfixable on Server 2003.

- The critical blunder allows miscreants to completely take over a domain-configured Windows system if it is connected to a malicious network  wirelessly or wired

- An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

- This remote-code execution flaw affects all supported versions of Windows

We think many apps could utilize this approach to defeat DPI filtering, and that this would be useful to offer decoupled from the way Tor integrates it.

- Guardian Project announced the first release candidate for version 14.1 of ChatSecure

- meek has so far been a smashing success. Its the #2 pluggable transport behind obfs3 and it moved over 5 TB of traffic last month. But the costs are starting to get serious.

## AES-CMAC on an ATtiny85

- built a custom door chime using an ATtiny85. Unlike most commercial products out there, this one actually tries to be secure, using AES-CMAC for message signing.

- It uses the ATtiny85 for control, with an LM380N audio amplifier, and a low cost 315 MHz receiver

- The source code has been released into the public domain, so the rest of us can implement crypto on this cheap microcontroller with much less effort.

- the assembly code is very well commented

## Hacker catches Apple's Lightning in a jailbroken bottle

- Apples Lightning connector protocols have been pried open in what could be a boon for the jailbreaking community

- The coder identified that Apple uses the Tristar chip to connect Lightning UART, baseband and JTAG

- promised to build a batch of the Lightning debug cables

- How much of the hackers work was unique, as opposed to a composition of purchased Chinese hardware and the probing of a protocol through a logic analyser, is up for debate

## How omnipotent hackers tied to NSA hid for 14 yearsand were found at last

- ne or more prestigious researchers received a CD by mail that contained pictures and other materials from a recent scientific conference they attended in Houston. The scientists didnt know it then, but the disc also delivered a malicious payload developed by a highly advanced hacking operation that had been active since at least 2001

- the Equation Group

- secretly intercepted a package in transit, booby-trapped its contents, and sent it to its intended destination

- The use of virtual file systems, a feature also found in the highly sophisticated Regin malware

- The stashing of malicious files in multiple branches of an infected computers registry

- Redirects that sent iPhone users to unique exploit Web pages

- The use of more than 300 Internet domains and 100 servers to host a sprawling command and control infrastructure

- USB stick-based reconnaissance malware to map air-gapped network

- An unusual if not truly novel way of bypassing code-signing restrictions in modern versions of Windows, which require that all third-party software interfacing with the operating system kernel be digitally signed by a recognized certificate authority. To circumvent this restriction, Equation Group malware exploited a known vulnerability in an already signed driver for CloneCD to achieve kernel-level code execution

## Japan's death threat hacker collared ... BY A CAT

- A Japanese hacker who hijacked computers using malware before issuing death threats through the compromised machines has been jailed for eight years

- Yusuke Katayama, 32, threatened to blow up planes and attack a kindergarten attended by the grandchildren of Japans Emperor Akihito before he was finally nabbed

- The self-styled Demon Killer led police on a wild goose chase involving the arrest of several innocent parties throughout 2012

- he was undone by a treasure hunt that ultimately led police to a cat with a contaminated SD card in its collar.

- CCTV footage from the island of Enoshima near Tokyo showed Katayama playing with his feline accomplice.

- Two of these hapless suspects confessed to crimes which the National Police Agency was later obligated to admit they had had no involvement in

- Police held one suspect for several weeks before the media received anonymous messages referencing information that only the real culprit would have known

- Subsequent examination revealed that a memory chip in the cats collar was contaminated by malware

## danoctavian/bit-smuggler

- bit-smuggler is a tool designed to allow you to defeat internet censorship by tunneling your network traffic through what appears to be a genuine bittorrent peer connection

- Reasons:

- lots of it - high volume, many users -> hard, expensive to do surveillance on it

- eg. GHCQs TEMPORA surveillance system throws away all P2P according to these snowden docs

- normally not banned in censoring countries (because fuck copyright)

- naturally high throughput upstream/downstream

- To actually detect this in real time you need to do TCP packet reconstruction, fetch the original torrent file, compute hashes and detect a high occurence of hash fails. Sounds like a lot of expensive work.

- It is recommended that all SSL systems be set to disallow backward compatibility of there is a newer version that is more secure.

- Patch Tuesday in February was huge with a total of 56 vulnerabilities being fixed in Microsoft products

- A majority of the patches were for Internet Explorer

- It is recommended that organizations keep awareness at a high level not only for regular employees but also specifically, the executives

- The Anthem breach for all intents and purposes, seems to have been Nation State actors and as such the data that they stole will not, and has not yet been seen to be for sale on the darknet or other places

- Superfish, a simple piece of adware that was installed on every system that Lenovo sold in the last couple of years

- If one cannot trust the supply chain (e.g. laptops from Lenovo without malware pre-loaded) how can one trust that the systems they are buying for their companies are secure?

## State Machine AttACKs against TLS (SMACK TLS)

- This page presents exploits and disclosure information related to these attacks.

- Message SKIPping Attacks

- the server authentication guarantee relies on the Server Key Exchange message in ephemeral Diffie-Hellman cipher suites (including ECDHE), whereas this message is completely skipped in the RSA key exchange

- We find that several TLS implementations incorrectly allow some messages to be skipped even though they are required for the selected cipher suite.

- JSSE clients allow the peer to skip all messages related to key exchange and authentication.

- FREAK: Factoring RSA Export Keys

- This attack targets a class of deliberately weak export cipher suites. As the name implies, this class of algorithms have been introduced under the pressure of US governments agencies to ensure that the NSA would be able to decrypt all foreign encrypted communication, while stronger algorithms were be banned from export (as they were classified as weapons of war).

- we discovered that several implementations incorrectly allow the message sequence of export ciphersuites to be used even if a non-export ciphersuite was negotiated.

- Thus, if a server is willing to negotiate an export ciphersuite, a man-in-the-middle may trick a browser (which normally doesn't allow it) to use a weak export key

- By design, export RSA moduli must be less than 512 bits long; hence, they can be factored in less than 12 hours for $50 on Amazon EC2.

## Slashdot

- The BlackPhone, a $600-plus encrypted Android handset designed to keep the prying eyes of criminals and the government out of mobile communications, is now fully owned by Silent Circle thanks to the company raking in investment cash

- Silent Circle said Thursday that it has raised $50 million and plans on showing off an encrypted 'enterprise privacy ecosystem' at World Mobile Congress next week. A BlackPhone tablet is on the way, too.

## Google quietly backs away from encrypting new Lollipop devices by default

- Last year, Google made headlines when it revealed that its next version of Android would require full-disk encryption on all new phones

- But were starting to see new Lollipop phones from Googles partners, and they arent encrypted by default,

- Google apparently decided to relax the requirement, pushing it off to some future version of Android

## Tracking the TLS FREAK Attack

- On Tuesday, March 3, 2015, researchers disclosed a new SSL/TLS vulnerability  the FREAK attack

- allows attackers to intercept HTTPS connections between vulnerable clients and servers and force them to use export-grade cryptogrpahy

- Websites that support RSA export cipher suites (e.g., TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA) are at risk to having HTTPS connections intercepted.

## Malicious Google Play apps (may have) hosed millions of Android handsets

- Security researchers have once again found Google Play offering malicious apps that have been downloaded by millions of Android users

- When you install Durak, it seems to be a completely normal and well working gaming app

- . After a week, you might start to feel there is something wrong with your device

- Each time you unlock your device an ad is presented to you, warning you about a problem, e.g. that your device is infected, out of date or full of porn

- You are then asked to take action, however, if you approve you get re-directed to harmful threats on fake pages, like dubious app stores and apps that attempt to send premium SMS behind your back or to apps that simply collect too much of your data for comfort while offering you no additional value.

- Update: About six hours after this post went live, a Google spokeswoman e-mailed to say the three apps have been pulled from Play.

## Battery power alone can be used to track Android phones

- A phone uses more power the further away it is from a cell tower as it tries to connect.

- Android phones can be tracked without using their GPS or wi-fi data by studying their power use over time, a study has found.

- The malicious app has neither permission to access the GPS nor other location providers (eg cellular or wi-fi network),

- We only assume permission for network connectivity and access to the power data.

## Jolla Partners To Build Secure Version Of Its Sailfish Mobile OS

- Finnish mobile startup Jolla, which develops the Sailfish mobile OS and its own brand mobile hardware, has just announced it will be partnering to create a security hardened version of the platform, called Sailfish Secure.

- Jolla says it will be working with Finlands SSH Communications

- SSH will be providing comms encryption and key management to Sailfish Secure.

- On the government side, the Russian Federation, ever wary of U.S. spying, recently gave a public show of support to alternative mobile platforms   singling out Sailfish for praise (along with Tizen) for not being made in the U.S. and for being open source.

- the Sailfish UI remains proprietary  so its not fully open sourced at this point.)
