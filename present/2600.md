## Spy agency whistle-blower posted top secret report to 4chan but users dismiss it as 'fake and gay'

- A whistle-blower anonymously published a highly sensitive report obtained from an Australian spy agency on the website 4chan,

- his document was soon automatically deleted after it failed to gain much attention.

- dismissed it as "fake and gay".

- The Defence Intelligence Organisation assessment contained information that could have been exploited by foreign intelligence services and risked causing serious harm to Australia's national security interests, according to the Australian Department of Defence.

## Is Extended Random A Malicious NSA Plot?  Quarrelsome

- Did Clyde Frog subvert crypto standards with a backdoored random number generator called Dual_EC

- Long after cryptographers published an analysis showing that Dual_EC could have been a backdoor, circumstantial evidence continues to pile up suggesting thats exactly what it was.

- Clyde Frog proposed a special kind of CSPRNG, a PKRNG, that generates output using a public key for which they hold the private key

- Using that private key, they can observe CSPRNG output on the wire, decrypt it, and use that to rewind and fast-forward other peoples CSPRNGs, discovering their keys.

- Clyde Frog pays IETF people to introduce a TLS extension, Extended Random. Extended Random alters TLS so that it discloses a variable amount of CSPRNG output, but always more than 28 bytes. Problem solved! Clyde Frog has standardized a backdoor (Dual_EC) and a TLS backdoor accelerator (Extended Random).

## Stop Windows 10 spying dead in its tracks with one free app

- Microsofts new operating system has been a hit with the tech press and users alike, with millions of people around the world singing the new software praise.

- We also shared an except from Microsofts Windows 10 privacy statementthat is more than a little disconcerting. Heres that excerpt again: Finally, we will access, disclose and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails, other private communications or files in private folders), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to: 1.comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies; 2.protect our customers, for example to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of the services, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone; 3.operate and maintain the security of our services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks; or 4.protect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services  however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customers private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.  Whether or not you might be considered a privacy nut, this should alarm you at least a little.

- Thats just the tip of the iceberg, though  there are a number of other things users concerned with privacy will want to address. Enter DoNotSpy10, a new free app from German developer pXc-coding.

- Namely, youll still need to go online to Microsofts site and opt out of the companysinvasive advertising tracking features.

- For complete instructions on how to do that, be sure to visit our earlier article. To download and install DoNotSpy10 for free, follow the link below in our source section. UPDATE: It should be noted that DoNotSpy10 is ad-supported, and it includes OpenCandy software that displays ads in other programs.

## Global spy system ECHELON confirmed at last  by leaked Snowden files

- Special Report Duncan Campbell has spent decades unmasking Britains super-secretive GCHQ, its spying programmes, and its cosy relationship with Americas NSA.

- In it, he tells the same fascinating story.  Update: Since this piece was published the Intercept have been in touch to say that it is deceptive of the Register to suggest that this is a joint publication.

- One of the locations I identified, Menwith Hill Station, a tapping center in the heart of England, has now been revealed in Edward Snowdens papers to be a global center for planned cyberwar. We also reported that electronic versions of the Enigma cypher were being sold to developing countries by European firms such as Crypto AG of Switzerland before those nations knew Britain had cracked the code. The day after publication, GCHQ relayed my article around the world.

- I went to Sunnyvale to meet Margaret Newsham, a former Lockheed employee, and to hear about unconstitutional NSA activity. I drove south on California Route 101.

- It was ignored for a decade, downplayed by many as European paranoia. In 1999, at last, ECHELON attracted the concern of Europes parliament, which commissioned an investigation.

## Samsung Woos Developers As It Eyes Tizen Expansion Beyond Smartphones

- a year later, it came out that Samsung was trying to use both git/gerrit and Perforce as version control for it [thedailywtf.com], mixed between different teams:

- Both repositories diverged to the point of being almost incompatible.

- the Korean teams didnt (and still dont) understand the notion of code review and pushed everything directly to the repo

- Finally, a solution was developed  MS Word based code review.

- Each changeset needs to be attached to a bug in the tracker

- Each bug can have a Word document attached with a request for code review

- Maybe someday someone will read how long pushing the code actually takes.

No, they wont.

## Advanced spyware for Android now available to script kiddies everywhere

- To wit, its the source code to a fully featured malware suite that had the ability to infect devices even when they were running newer versions of the Google-developed mobile operating system. The leak of the code base for RCSAndroidshort for Remote Control System Androidis a mixed blessing.

- On the one hand, it provides the blueprints to a sophisticated, real-world surveillance program that can help Google and others better defend the Android platform against malware attacks.

- On the other, it provides even unskilled hackers with all the raw materials they need to deploy whats arguably one of the worlds more advanced Android surveillance suites. The RCSAndroid code can be considered one of the most professionally developed and sophisticated Android malware [titles] ever exposed, researchers from security firm Trend Micro wrote in a recently published blog post.

- A second infection method was to use a fake news app called BeNews, which as Ars reported earlier this week was available on the official Google Play Android market.

- E-mails sent among Hacking Team executives showed that engineers were developing updates designed to work on version 5.0, but so far theres no indication any of the source code has gone public. The Android surveillance suite works like a cluster bomb that combines multiple attack tools, including the two exploits described above, low-level coding that greatly expands the type of data attackers can gather from infected phones, a higher-level APK installer package, and a command-and-control server infrastructure infected devices can connect to.

## Cybercrime forum Darkode returns with security, admins intact

- Crime forum Darkode has relaunched with renewed security two weeks after it was obliterated in a global police raid that shut down the site and saw members arrested.

- The site was eliminated earlier this month under the FBI and European Cybercrime Centre Operation Shrouded Horizon which netted at least 28 users and administrators from 20 countries, including the UK, the US, and Australia.

- Darkode.cc now operates with most of its staff and senior members intact, and uses the Tor routing service to provide users with unique web addresses, Sp3cial1st says in an update posted to the new site this week.

- The forum will be back in onion land, it will be invite only, and members we can confirm are still active will be given an invite [and] no-one else.

- Each user will have their own Onion, [and] authentication to the forum will be made via the Blockchain API.

## Stagefright Vulnerability in Android Phones

- @ Hardeep Singh Along with the alarming growth of the user base, android is the most vulnerable mobile OS of today.

- Android, being an open platform for publishing of app have made it highly accessible to developers, and also to hackers. Neither sentence is factual and is at best a hypothesis.

- This goes to one of my original statements, the problem space(s) is insufficiently enumerated or quantified to establish a level of completeness when it comes to defining functional security.

- Bruce has gone to some lengths in making risk analysis a part of the process of development, several of his books detail both the operational and developmental components of information security.

- There are efforts to formalize many aspects of computational theory but alas, their fate remains within the realm of the theoretical and not the applied.

## How the way you type can shatter anonymityeven on Tor

- researchers have refined a long-theoretical profiling technique into a highly practical attack that poses a threat to Tor users and anyone else who wants to shield their identity online.

- The profiling works by measuring the minute differences in the way each person presses keys on computer keyboards

- they have created a Chrome browser plugin thats designed to blunt the threat

- The real concern with behavioral profiling is when it is being done by multiple big websites owned by the same company or organization

## A technical summary of the Usenix fingerprinting paper

- To recap, this new paper describes three phases.

- In the first phase, they hope to get lucky and end up operating the entry guard for the Tor user they're trying to target

- In the second phase, the target user loads some web page using Tor, and they use a classifier to guess whether the web page was in onion-space or not

- Lastly, if the first classifier said "yes it was", they use a separate classifier to guess which onion site it was.

## MIT boffins identify Tor hidden services with 88 per cent accuracy

- Boffins from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have demonstrated a vulnerability in Tor which, if exploited, could lead to hidden services being identified with up to 88 per cent accuracy. Infosec bods from MIT and the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) pwned the anonymity network for a paper to be presented at this summers Usenix Security Symposium.

- This becomes possible by analysing the traffic patterns of encrypted data passing through a single computer in the all-volunteer Tor network. Tor, originally an acronym for The Onion Router, wraps communications in several layers of encryption, which is supposed to allow information to be passed through a number of parties without the recipient of the traffic from being uncovered. Hidden services are sites which use the Tor network to protect themselves in a similar fashion to the way the network anonymises users  by selecting nodes to use as introduction points, which the network will identify while keeping the rest of its gubbins anonymous. For the Tor network to work, it is necessary that computers exchange a large amount of data during the establishment of a connection to a hidden service. The boffins showed that simply by looking for patterns in the number of packets passing in each direction through a guard, machine-learning algorithms could, with 99 per cent accuracy, determine whether the circuit was an ordinary Web-browsing circuit, an introduction-point circuit or a rendezvous-point circuit. They were able to do this through simple traffic correlation, which is available even when the traffic is encrypted.  Furthermore, by using a Tor-enabled computer to connect to a range of different hidden services, they showed that a similar analysis of traffic patterns could identify those services with 88 per cent accuracy.

- That means that an adversary who lucked into the position of guard for a computer hosting a hidden service, could, with 88 per cent certainty, identify it as the services host.  We recommend that [the Tor project] mask the sequences so that all the sequences look the same, said Mashael AlSabah, an assistant professor of computer science at Qatar University, as well as a researcher at QCRI and a visiting scientist at MIT.

- This paper showed that its possible to do it passively  but it still requires an attacker to have a foot in the network and to gather data for a certain period of time. We are considering their countermeasures as a potential improvement to the hidden service, he added.

- But I think we need more concrete proof that it definitely fixes the issue. A spokesman for the Tor Project told The Registeri/: Its is a known issue that hidden service circuits are noticeable in certain situations, but this attack is very difficult to execute.

## New attack on Tor can deanonymize hidden services with surprising accuracy

- That means that an adversary who lucked into the position of guard for a computer hosting a hidden service, could, with 88 percent certainty, identify it as the services host. Similarly, a spy who lucked into the position of guard for a user could, with 88 percent accuracy, tell which sites the user was accessing. Further ReadingFeds used Adobe Flash to identify Tor users visiting child porn sitesOperation Torpedo relied on long-abandoned Metasploit Decloaking Engine.The research is sure to interest governments around the world, including the US.

- Recently unsealed court documents also show the FBI seizing a Tor-hidden child porn site and allowing it to run for weeks so agents could gather evidence on visitors.

- In an e-mail, Tor project leader Roger Dingledine said the requirements of the attack greatly limited its effectiveness in real-world settings.

- Such entry guards in theory are assigned randomly, so attackers would have to operate a large number of Tor nodes to have a reasonable expectation of seeing traffic of a given hidden service.

- So the next research step is to find out if its easy or hard to design a classifier that isnt fooled by padding. The full text of Dingledines e-mail is below: This is a well-written paper.

## Hacking a 'Smart' Sniper Rifle

- An anonymous reader writes: It was inevitable: as soon as we heard about computer-aimed rifles, we knew somebody would find a way to compromise their security.

- At the upcoming Black Hat security conference, researchers Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger will present their techniques for doing just that.

- In one demonstration they were able to tweak the rifle's ballistic calculations by making it think a piece of ammunition weighed 72 lbs instead of 0.4 ounces.

- After changing this value, the gun tried to automatically adjust for the weight, and shot significantly to the left.

- Fortunately, they couldn't find a way to make the gun fire without physically pulling the trigger.

## Small number of computer-aided rifles could be hacked in contrived scenario

- If the trigger isnt pulled the gun wont fire, no matter what the hacker may do. What a hacker can do, though, is tamper with variables in the ballistic calculator so as to change where the bullet will strike:  Sandvik and Auger havent figured out why, but theyve observed that higher ammunition weights aim a shot to the left, while lower or negative values aim it to the right.

- Even then, all you can do is alter the direction of aim by quite small angles, brick the gunsight, or prevent the weapon from firing. We should also remember that total TrackingPoint sales arent thought to have been much more than a thousand, despite the massive hype around it.

- It also includes image stabilisation and a trigger cutout which wont let the user take a shot until he or she is on target. What the TrackingPoint cant do anything about is wind, the real bugbear of the long-range marksman.

- The trigger control compensates for some mistakes that bad shooters tend to make, involving pulling the trigger when the sights are not on the target. But a TrackingPoint system is heavy, complicated, extremely expensive and has a short battery life, so it has sold poorly - and indeed the company appears to be in serious trouble. A scope with similar capabilities to the TrackingPoint is included in the US Armys XM-25 Judge Dredd style smartgun, a rather more interesting weapons development, which has been on the verge of introduction to service for some years now. Experience has shown that some of our US readers may doubt that any Limey journo wiener could know anything of guns, weaponry, tactics etc.

- So, for the record, your correspondents canned death-tech CV:  Only significant childhood experience firing a Lee Enfield .303 at the age of five and getting knocked flat on my arse (irresponsible but popular uncle involved).

## Major flaw could let lone-wolf hacker bring down huge swaths of Internet

-  Rob Graham  A recently disclosed vulnerability in Bind, the most widely used software for translating human-friendly domain names into IP addresses used by servers, makes it possible for lone-wolf attackers to bring down huge swaths of the Internet, a security researcher has warned. The flaw, which involves the way that Bind handles some queries related to transaction key records, resides in all major versions of the software from 9.1.0 to 9.8.x, 9.9.0 to 9.9.7-P1, and 9.10.0 to 9.10.2-P2.

- Still, the critical vulnerability underscores the fragility of Bind, which despite its three decades in use and unwieldy code remains the staple for the Internets domain name system. Rob Graham, CEO of penetration testing firm Errata Security, reviewed some of the Bind source code and the advisory that Bind developers issued earlier this weekand made this sobering assessment: BIND9 is the oldest and most popular DNS server.

- I could use my masscan tool to blanket the Internet with those packets and crash all publicly facing BIND9 DNS servers in about an hour.

- Graham regularly scans almost the entire Internet to get an estimate of how many servers remain affected by the Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL and other major software weaknesses.

- The result: Bind has all the security weaknesses that come with those programming languages without the speed that often justifies their use anyway. Graham concluded: The point Im trying to make here is that BIND9 should not be exposed to the public.

## 'White hats don't want to work for us' moans understaffed FBI

- The Federal Bureau of Investigation is struggling to hire computer scientists, according to a Department of Justice audit of the feebs attempts to implement its Next Generation Cyber Initiative. A 34-page audit report (PDF) from the DoJ notes that, while making considerable progress, the FBI has encountered challenges in attracting external participants to its established Cyber Task Forces.

- Noting that the FBI has not fully met its goals for the initiative, the DoJ reports foremost complaint is that the feebs international public-private alliance  known as the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF)  does not have a process to measure the timeliness of information sharing among members. The NCIJTF recently made headlines when, alongside its international colleagues, it took down the cybercrime forum Darkode.

- For a few days, anyway. The audit also bemoaned how hiring and retaining qualified white hats remained a challenge for the FBI, especially when competing private-sector entities pay more and have less invasive recruitment processes. The FBI reportedly did not hire 52 of the 134 computer scientists for which it was authorised, meaning 38 per cent of the workforce it requires (as per budget) is simply not there. This additionally means that five of the FBIs 56 field offices do not have even a single computer scientist assigned to their Cyber Task Force. Back in 2011, the Office of the Inspector General gave the FBI a thorough scolding over its inability to address Americas cyber-intrusion threat, for which it has become the responsible national body.

- The Next Generation Cyber Initiative was launched in response, essentially as a platform for funding increases in the face of a swelling number of data breaches and cyber-attacks in recent years. This is not the first mention of the FBIs difficulties in recruiting infosec professionals.

- Last year, the feebs director James Comey said the company was re-examining its drugs policy as too many applicants seemed to be enjoying a doobie en route to interview.

## Mt Gox's Mark Karpeles arrested in Japan

- 

- French-born Mark Karpeles, head of the failed Mt Gox Bitcoin exchange, has been arrested in Japan. The arrest comes eight months after Japanese police said they were confident the incident that saw most of the Bitcoin held by Mt Gox evaporate was the result of fraudulent transactions.

- Karpeles had previously claimed the lost Bitcoin  worth hundreds of millions of dollars  were stolen in cyber-attacks, which led to the collapse of Mt Gox. This Agence France Presse report adds that Tokyo police have told local media theyre investigating Karpeles possible involvement in the disappearance of Bitcoin worth around US$390 million in todays rates. The Yomiuri newspaper says police believe Karpeles repeatedly transferred clients Bitcoins into his own account for speculative trading. Japans Kyodo News reports Karpeles lawyers statement that he denies having done anything illegal, reports the BBC. Karpeles claim that Mt Goxs losses stemmed from Bitcoins transaction malleability bug lay at the heart of the exchanges problems was later debunked by researchers. Earlier this year, an analysis by Tokyo-based WizSec investigators suggested that the Mt Gox exchange had leaked Bitcoin for a number of years.

## Drones, Tor & Remailers  The Story Of A High-Tech Kidnapping

- But the bizarre story of a former Marine and Harvard-trained lawyer who allegedly masterminded the abduction of a California woman is notable for more than the twists and misdirections that made it fodder for CNN.

- Its a rare kidnapping-for-ransom scheme that availed itself fully of the riches of the Internet age, providing a glimpse of a future where brutal, physical crime and its digital analog merge into one. FBI court filings unsealed last week showed how Denise Huskins kidnappers used anonymous remailers, image sharing sites, Tor, and other peoples Wi-Fi to communicate with the police and the media, scrupulously scrubbing meta data from photos before sending.

- They tried to use computer spyware and a DropCam to monitor the aftermath of the abduction and had a Parrot radio-controlled drone standing by to pick up the ransom by remote control. All the high-tech theatrics may be part of why the police concluded that the whole thing was a hoax, until the FBI linked the abduction to a former attorney who once made the Journal of the American Bar Associations list of techiest lawyers for his computer skills.  It makes for really good reading, and it really goes to show..truth really is often stranger than fiction. The irony is, he was tripped up by technology..and really simple technology.

- Why didnt he just pay some kid $5 to go into the store and buy the phone for him? Rookie mistake. Its unclear how much of the elaborate backstory in last Marchs anonymous emails is reality, and how much is fantasy.

- Or was the illusion of accomplices another creation of Mullers twisted mind, perhaps he played back audio of muffled conversations to make the victims think there were multiple assailants. Who knows?

## Amazon Echo Orders the Roku About

-  You can add the Roku media player to the list of devices that can be bossed about by the Amazon Echo and its built-in AI: Alexa.

- [Julian Hartline] has figured out how to use Amazons voice-controlled Echo device with a Roku media player.

- That allows you to add functions to the Alexa and the AWS Lambda cloud service that processes the voice commands (Amazon calls this an Alexa Skill). Rather than have the cloud service talk directly to the Roku, though, he decided to have a local node.js server act as an intermediary.

- In the example shown, Alexa actually causes the Roku to launch Netflix and input a search string for the requested show.

- The WeMo functionality he mentions has been hack as an additional way to hook into the closed Echo system.

- The end result is what he calls EchoNestPy. [ZPriddy] started by learning how to use the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK).

- ASK is the official SDK that allows enthusiasts to add functionality to their Amazon Echo.

- Unfortunately for [ZPriddy], most of the example code he found was designed to be used on Amazon Lambda, but that didnt stop him.

- After finding a few examples of Amazon Echo requests and responses, he was on his way. [ZPriddy] chose to implement a simple web server using Flask.

- Go check out badssl and watch your browser light up in new and exciting ways! scans.io - raw results from massive scale SSL scans Need to see who's using different validation levels?

- Who's using SNI or other tech? Last time we needed to do a large scale SSL scan we wrote the code ourselves.

- Since then, we've discovered the scans.io repository of large scale SSL scan results, including handshakes, certificates and all the usual goodies you'd expect.

- Check out the discussion on Hacker News. About CertSimple EV certificates are how websites prove a company's identity. Getting an EV certificate normally involves a bunch of work and a 10 day wait. CertSimple takes 80 seconds to apply and gets you an EV certificate in an average of 5 hours.

## Detecting VPN (and its configuration!) and proxy users on the server side

## Three Estonians jailed for malware spree that infected 4 MILLION computers

- Three Estonians have been sentenced to a cumulative 11 years for their cybercrime activities which infected more than four million computers with malware across more than 100 countries. The three crims, who were sent down by US District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in Manhattan on Thursday, were: Timur Gerassimenko, 35, who received a four-year sentence and was ordered to forfeit $2.5m; Dmitiri Jegorov, 37, who received a 44 month sentence and must forfeit $1m; and Konstantin Poltev, 31, who was sentenced to 40 months imprisonment and to forfeit $1m.

- The trio were charged as part of a party of seven in 2011.

- That comprised six Estonians and one Russian. At least 500,000 of the infected computers were in the US, including computers belonging to US government agencies, including NASA. The defendants malware secretly altered the settings on infected computers, allowing them to digitally hijack net searches and re-route computers to certain websites and advertisements  thus earning revenue for the cybercriminals. Prosecutors said the gang earned $14m through its activities. The gang ran a scheme of click hijacking and ad replacement fraud, the latter of which used the DNS Changer Malware and rogue DNS servers to substitute advertisements which were triggered to provide payments to the gang. The original indictment further alleged that the gang laundered the proceeds of their scheme through numerous companies including, among others, Rove Digital, an Estonian corporation. As the malware prevented the installation of anti-virus software and operating system updates on infected computers, those computers and their users were exposed to additional attacks by other viruses  causing, in the case of NASA, more than $65,000 in damages. Following the trios sentencing this week, only one Estonian member of the gang, Vladimir Tsastsin, remains to be sentenced.

- Tsastsin entered a guilty plea earlier this month. Of the other members of the alleged gang, Valeri Aleksejev was sentenced to 48 months in prison, while Anton Ivanov pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to time served. The last defendant, Andrey Taame, who is a Russian national, remains at large, and is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

## Hacking Team gets hacked; invoices suggest spyware sold to repressive govts

- It instead markets itself as a supplier of customized software for law enforcement departments and government agencies in countries with good human rights records.

- As proof, the hacktivists posted invoices purporting to show malware sales to groups in Egypt, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Since we have nothing to hide, were publishing all our e-mails, files, and source code, the hackers wrote in a tweet that included a BitTorrent link tothe alleged trove of documents.

- The British news organization reported a separate document showing Hacking Team negotiating with a third-party reseller to export malware to Nigeria.

- Given the strong dislike of Hacking Team, it wouldnt be surprising if less law-abiding groups targeted the Italian firm and deliberately orchestrated a massive data breach.

- In 2014, documents leaked online showed that software created by the controversial UK-based Gamma Group International was used to spy on computers that appeared to be located in the US, the UK, Germany, Russia, Iran, and Bahrain.

## Hacking Team havoc shows even 'security experts' suck at security

- Analysis Over the weekend, 400GB of highly sensitive files belonging to Italian malware spyware software house Hacking Team were spread over the internet for everyone to see. The leaked source code and documents look legit, and match what is already known about the secretive firm, which specializes in selling software for monitoring people to governments around the world.

- Persons unknown appear to have completely pwned the company, but this shouldnt come as a surprise since weve seen exactly the same sort of thing before from security specialists. Anyone remember HBGary Federal?

- That firm was a security consultancy set up to offer contracts to governments and corporations, again involving tracking people online and seeking to influence them, for a fee. In February 2011 HBGary Federals CEO Aaron Barr gave an interview ahead of that years BSides security conference in the US in which he claimed to be tracking members of the Anonymous hacking collective online, and that he was in a position to name names. That set off warning bells with Anonymous and some of the groups members made HBGary Federal a target.

- But whereas the group had mostly limited itself to denial-of-service attacks in the past, this time the team plundered HBGarys servers and stole thousands of emails and documents before putting them online. The email released was rather embarrassing, since it showed HBGary Federal was pitching a plan to discredit WikiLeaks and its supporters by manipulating journalists and waging a dirty tricks campaign against the whistleblowing site. What should have been a triumphant month for the firm turned into a disaster.

- The firm also inked a $1m+ deal with Saudi Arabia, which flogs and imprisons citizens who dare to suggest that everything is less than hunky dory in the Arabic theocracy. Even the FBI has been buying up the Hacking Teams software, spending more than $700,000 on the spyware, the purloined documents state.

## Pwned Hacking Team tells cops, govts to shut down software

- 

- Flayed surveillance outfit Hacking Team is telling customers to suspend running instances of its software after 400GB of its source code and internal data was stolen and posted online. The Milan company sells spy software to law enforcement agencies, and has been accused by activist groups of happily signing up oppressive governments as clients.

- Documents revealed in the huge cache made public yesterday after the company was savagely hacked appear to confirm it had dealings with police and security agencies in countries with patchy human rights records including Egypt, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan. Western government agencies including the Australian Federal Police, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration are also listed. The company has now asked customers to temporarily suspend use of its software while it investigates if their spying operations have been exposed among the huge cache of released emails and source code. Hacking Team spokesman Eric Rabe told Reuters that it is recommending clients suspend use of its programs until it can confirm whether law enforcement operations have been compromised. We would expect this to be a relatively short suspension of service, Rabe says. It is the first official comment from the company after employees suggested on Twitter that the torrent file being shared contained viruses, a statement that triggered ripples of mirth within the infosec community. Much of the fallout of the hack has yet to arise as leaked emails and source code are studied. The identity behind the hack of rival surveillance firm Gamma Group claimed responsibility on Twitter for the Hacking Team crack.

## Google yanks fake Android battery monitor

- The company reckons the malicious version of the BatteryBot battery indicator app was probably trying to put together an army of compromised devices for click fraud, ad fraud and premium SMS scams. Now removed from Play, the fake BatteryBot Pro was offered for free (the real thing sells for 179.99 Rupees, about US$2.84), and as Zscalers Shivang Desai writes, its intentions were revealed by the permissions it seeks (basically, everything). It also tries to gather various device stats like available memory, IMEI, carrier, location, language, phone model, and SIM card availability. Particular red flags identified by the group were the fake seeking administrative control over a downloaders device.

- Its background activity included loading fraudulent ad libraries. Upon installation of the malicious app, it demanded administrative access, which clearly portrays the motive of malware developer to obtain full control access of the victims device, Desai writes. Once the permission is granted, the fake app will provide the same functionality to the victim found in the original version of BatteryBot Pro but performs malicious activity in the background. Too many permissions: Zscalers comparison of real-versus-fake requests  The SMS fraud is carried out by having the malicious app contact a command and control server to retrieve premium-rate SMS numbers.

- That would let the miscreants in charge of the app respond with new target numbers if someone like a carrier cancelled the scam accounts. Zscaler notes that the app is hard to delete  with admin privileges, its beyond the ordinary user, and theres an extra nasty.

- A separate persistence package called com.nb.superuser runs on a different thread and survives deletion of the main app.

- That lets the persistence app re-install the fake battery monitor if the user roots their phone and kills the malware.

## Dutch MEP whacks Hacking Team over embargo-busting

- The Hacking Team fallout continues, with Dutch member of the European Parliament Marietje Schaake asking for a European Commission (EC) investigation into the outfit. Schaake wants the EC to decide whether Hacking Team broke various embargo rules by selling products to repressive regimes (she name-checks Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Uzbekistan in this blog post).

- She singles out a sale to Sudan as a possible violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1556, 1591, 1945, 2091 and 2138, and that the sale would also violate Council Decision 2014/450/CFSP of 10 July 2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Sudan. Her questions for the European Commission, posted here, are:  1) Does the Commission believe Hacking Team has violated EU sanctions regimes?

- 2) Has the Commission been informed of any prior authorisation given by the Italian authorities that would allow Hacking Team to export its products to Sudan or Russia, and is the Commission aware of a global authorization that was given by the Italian authorities to Hacking Team that authorised the company to export its products freely in all countries of the Wassenaar agreement?

- 3) Has Hacking Team ever asked DG FPI any question regarding its interpretation of the EU sanctions regime against Sudan or Russia?  An unfavourable finding would open up a new world of pain for the Italian surveillanceware outfit.

## Days after Hacking Team breach, nobody fired, no customers lost

- I dont know, I wouldnt anticipate that happening, but maybe if somebody was found to be negligent, he told Ars by phone early Wednesday morning from the companys headquarters in Milan, Italy, where he was summoned shortly after the epic hack. A 400GB file, distributed via BitTorrent,reportedly includes not only various employee e-mails but also source code, financial documents, and more.

- In recent years, Hacking Team sold its spywaredesignedto combat criminal activityto various governments globally (including American federal law enforcement).

- Businesses are frequently the subject of such attacks like this, and sometimes theyre successful. Surprisingly, Rabe also claimed that Hacking Team has not suffered beyond utter embarrassment for the time being. I dont think weve lost any clients at this point.

- I think they completely understand why thats a reasonable request, but we dont know if every single customer has. When asked if it was appropriate for a Hacking Team Senior System and Security Engineer who may have been the original vector for the attack to have a list of links to a pornographic website on his work computer, Rabe said emphatically no. A file (NSFW) attributed to Christian Pozzis desktop, whose laughably weak plaintext passwords (including his since-changed Gmail password: Passw0rd!81) were exposed as part of the breach and whose Twitter account was hacked, contained a list of several porn-related links. Do I think that employees should have pornography on their work computer?

- After all, he pointed out, more than a dozen of the September 11 hijackers were from that country. Do you want Saudi Arabia to be able to track that sort of thing or would you rather have them be able to operate behind contemporary secrecy and the Internet? he said. My point is not really to argue the various dangers of different kinds of equipment but just to say that if youre going to sell weaponry to a country, its a little disingenuous to say that a crime-fighting tool is off-limits. Rabe ended the call with a forceful defense of the companys entire business model, saying that there should be a controlled, appropriate way for governments and law enforcement to breach digital security. [CEO David Vincenzetti] started life in what we would call defensive security, to keep people out, and then he realized as more and more of the communications became inaccessible, that there was a need for a tool that gave investigators the opportunity to do surveillance, he said.

## Hacking Team: Oh great, good job, guys ... now the TERRORISTS have our zero-day exploits

- Spyware peddler Hacking Team is moaning that, since its internal source code was leaked online, its tools for infecting PCs with malware are now in the hands of terrorists and extortionists. The Italian biz is not wrong  in a way: the leaked code, which exploits vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and the Windows operating system to hijack computers, has already made its way into criminals toolkits.

- But one could argue that it would have been highly useful if Hacking Team hadnt left this sort of code lying around for someone to steal in the first place.

- Adobe has now patched the security bug in its Flash plugin, and Microsoft is working on a fix for its vulnerable kernel driver. It is now apparent that a major threat exists because of the posting by cyber criminals of Hacking Team proprietary software on the internet the night of July 6, reads a statement on the Hacking Team website. Hacking Teams investigation has determined that sufficient code was released to permit anyone to deploy the software against any target of their choice. Before the attack, Hacking Team could control who had access to the technology which was sold exclusively to governments and government agencies.

- We believe this is an extremely dangerous situation. Hacking Team was thoroughly owned by hackers who managed to extract and dump online this week 400GB of internal company data, including the blueprints to its surveillance software tools and lists of the governments and organizations it had sold the spyware to. Among those who were said to have purchased the Hacking Team Remote Control System (RCS) spyware package were the authorities in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Russia, and Honduras.

- The US government was also a customer. Now, Hacking Team warns, the leak will allow its surveillance tools to be used by anyone who has the technical ability to use its software. Hacking Team said that virtually all of its customers have stopped using RCS, and its programmers are working around the clock on a fix, though it remains to be seen just what the fix would be for having the source code and customer list of your flagship product posted on the BitTorrent network, various websites and GitHub. The leaked files also showed that Hacking Team was working on a key-logging Newsstand replacement app for iOS devices; victims would have to be tricked into installing the software from outside the official Apple Store.

## Hacking Team: We're the good guys, but SO misunderstood. Like Batman

- The boss of Italian spy firm Hacking Team has spoken out for the first time about the recent massive hack of the company databases.

- This has exposed severe software security holes and gifted terrorists with zero-day exploits, among other things. David Vincenzetti, in an interview with La Stampa newspaper, claimed his firm would recover from the attack and alleged that an unnamed government or organisation with considerable funds had infiltrated its data servers and leaked the information.

- On Friday, a large cache of Hacking Team emails was published by WikiLeaks, after 400GB of the source code of highly sensitive files was spaffed online a week ago. While the missives appeared to show the lengths the Hacking Team would go to in order to sell its surveillance tools to repressive regimes such as Libya, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, Vincenzetti attempted a face-saving PR exercise with the Italian newspaper this weekend. He was quoted as saying: The geopolitical [landscape] changes rapidly, and sometimes situations evolve.

- Were the good guys.  However, commentators may strongly disagree with that claim in light of the emails that are now available online for anyone to view - not to mention further developments such as this.

## Hacking Team orchestrated brazen BGP hack to hijack IPs it didnt own

- Although the /24 block of affected addresses was small and inexplicably inactive at the time, the hijacking is already generating criticism not only of the worlds continued dependence on the insecure framework, but also of the impropriety of Aruba, Hacking Team, and the Italian government for jointly making the fraud happen. BGP is a stupid, old, insecure core protocol of the Internet, Filippo Valsorda, an Italian security researcher, told Ars.

- In late 2013, Dyn Research presented evidence showing that huge chunks of Internet traffic belonging to financial institutions, government agencies, and network service providers had repeatedly been diverted to distant and unauthorized locations, stoking suspicions the traffic may have been surreptitiously monitored or modified before ultimately reaching its intended destination.

- The Hacking Team e-mails show the impunity employees felt as they worked to hijack the block of inactive IP addresses, some of which hosted virtual private servers (VPSes) used as part of a command and control system for the computers infected with the RCS malware.

- Word of the hijacking first surfaced on Friday here. As noted earlier in this post, the ease of fraudulently manipulating the BGP system has long been recognized as a key weak point in Internet security.

- These techniques can be used to intercept or manipulate the contents of affected Internet traffic or simply to blackhole traffic. Post updated to change we to they in the quoted e-mail.

## Hacking Team's snoopware 'spied on anti-communist activists in Vietnam'

- Security researchers are linking malware sent to anti-communist activists in Vietnam to controversial commercial spyware firm Hacking Team. The assault dating from 2012-13 appears to use Hacking Teams MSN+Skype tabs, according to preliminary analysis by MalwareMustDie.

- The discovery shows how countries, particularly those with lesser financial and technical resources, might be trying to bridge the gap in their snooping capabilities using commercial tools. Maybe some day @FireEye @PaloAltoNtwks or @kaspersky will discover links between previously observed APT groups and HT, added Chaouki Bekrar, founder of controversial exploit broker firm Vupen, in what may well be a tongue-in-cheek remark.

- Hacking Team bought zero-days from Vupen, according to leaked emails. Hacking Team, which markets offensive technology to the worldwide law enforcement and intelligence communities, has been put under the spotlight by a recent high-profile breach that resulted in the leak of 400GB of confidential files and emails.

- A searchable archive of leaked emails set up by WikiLeaks in the wake of the megahack show that the controversial Italian firm was involved in projects in Indonesia and Vietnam, among many other countries. Must dig [into] PoC in the HT dump on the Vietnam archive within 2012-2013 to be sure, but Shellcode + DLL injected payload looks theirs, @MalwareMustDie told El Reg via Twitter.

## Hacking Team broke Bitcoin secrecy by targeting crucial wallet file

- These documents clearly illustrate how simply Hacking TeamsMoney Module worked, and they provide a small glimpse into which customers were particularly interested in it. In general, the Italian spyware company sold (and hopes to continue to sell) software that allowed targets to be surreptitiously surveilled as they used computers or smartphones, and its clientele included law enforcement agencies worldwide.Back in January 2014, Hacking Team internallyannounceda new feature as part of its version 9.2 upgrade to its Remote Control System suite, and the new iteration would include a way to track cryptocurrencies, such as BitCoin [sic], and all the related information. The Money Module also included support for Bitcoin alternatives including Litecoin, Feathercoin, and Namecoin. Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California, went through the same e-mails.

- The biggest difference is that the FBI didnt need to digitally infiltrate acomputer in that casethey had physically seized Ulbrichts device, still running, during aninfamous raid at the San Francisco library. Using Hacking Teams solution, it wouldnt matter if atarget had encrypted wallet.dat, nor if he or she was using an online wallet (such as Coinbase.com).

- [Law enforcement agencies], by using our Intelligence module combined with this new capability, can correlate the usage of cryptocurrencies, defeating the financial opacity they provide. Hours later, CEO David Vincenzetti responded: Well done!!

- ! Egyptian, Saudi authorities interested in Bitcoin tracking At the moment, no one knows the comprehensive list of who installed or used Money Module Version 9.2 in early 2014.

- That is, a modification of the actual Bitcoiin [sic], something different, fully traceable and supported by clearing houses and the global financial system as a whole might have a future. In May 2015, after Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison as a result of being convicted of running Silk Road, Vincenzetti again opined on Bitcoin: An exemplary punishment.

## Hacking Team spyware rootkit: Even a new HARD DRIVE wouldn't get rid of it

- Hacking Team RCS spyware came pre-loaded with an UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) BIOS rootkit to hide itself on infected systems, it has emerged following the recent hacking of the controversial surveillance firm. The stealth infection tactic, which has been revealed through leaked emails arising from last weeks hack, meant that the Remote Control System (RCS) agent stayed on compromised machines even if users formatted their drives - or even swapped disks.

- A PowerPoint from the leaked Hacking Team emails implies that initial infection seems to require physical access to targeted systems.

- Other techniques may be possible, according to Trend Micro, based on a preliminary analysis of the leaked presentation as well as an examination of a help tool for the users of Hacking Teams BIOS rootkit and other leaked data. A Hacking Team slideshow presentation claims that successful infection requires physical access to the target system; however, we cant rule out the possibility of remote installation, writes Philippe Lin, a senior engineer at Trend Micro.

- For example last month Trend spotlighted work by independent researcher Pedro Vilaca on how UEFI attacks against Mac systems might be possible.

- Windows systems have long been known to be potentially vulnerable to UEFI-based attacks. Separately, security researchers Xeno Kovah and Corey Kallenberg recently warned that the poor state of low-level software security is among the easiest ways for hackers to deeply infiltrate organisations.

## FireEye intern nailed in Darkode downfall was VXer, say the Feds

- A former intern at security company FireEye has been arrested for creating and selling the slick and sophisticated Dendroid malware program after being caught in a global police sting that obliterated the Darkode cybercrime forum. Prosecutors say that Morgan Culbertson, 20, of Pittsburgh, was most recently working as a whitehat anti-malware professional at the security giant while also building and selling Dendroid, a product which the company would label its chief enemy.

- Enquiries remain ongoing, a spokesperson said. Dendroid is a sophisticated toolkit allowing thieves to evade Googles Play Store security controls dubbed Bouncer by using anti-emulation to prevent execution of malcode. 

- Open a dialogue box to ask for passwords or send messages to the victim   The Darkode sting has been chalked up as the slaying of one of the most gravest threats to user security. Of the roughly 800 criminal internet forums worldwide, Darkode represented one of the gravest threats to the integrity of data on computers in the United States and around the world and was the most sophisticated English-speaking forum for criminal computer hackers in the world, Pennsylvania attorney David J. Hickton said in an official statement.

- FBI deputy director Mark F. Giuliano added that it is a milestone in the bid to sever the ability for crimeware to be bought and sold. The second alleged Darkode administrator, Johan Anders Gudmunds, 27, of Sweden, saw him also being accused of creating the Crimepack exploit kit.

- He was jailed for almost five years in 2014. Various other bot and malware writers, spammers, and credit card thieves were nicked. Security crime reporter Brian Krebs, who has made a name for himself by playing identities on the likes of Darkode, has dumped a series of screenshots he took inside the forum and detailed further exploits of its participants.

## Hacking Teams evil Android app had code to bypass Google Play screening

- Hacking Team Hacked Advanced spyware for Android now available to script kiddies everywhere Hacking Team may not have had a backdoor, but it could kill client installs Hacking Team goes to war against former employees, suspects some helped hackers Firm stops selling exploits after delivering Flash 0-day to Hacking Team Hacking Team built drone-based Wi-Fi hacking hardware View all Security researchers at Trend Micros Trend Labs have uncovered a trick in a sample of a fake news application for Android created by the network exploitation tool provider Hacking Team that may have allowed the companys customers to sneak spyware through the Google Play stores code review.

- While the application in question may have only been downloaded fewer than 50 times from Google Play, the technique may have been used in other Android apps developed for Hacking Team customersand may now be copied by others trying to get malware onto Android devices. The sample app, called BeNews, is designed as a Trojan horse for Hacking Teams RCSAndroid backdoor malware.

- Wish Wu of Trend Labs wrote in a blog post that Trend Labs team found the source code for the app within the leaked Hacking Team files, along with documentation that teaches customers how to use it, he wrote.

- Initially, it only asks for three permissions and can be deemed safe by Googles security standards as there are no exploit codes to be found in the app, Wish noted.

- But after the application is downloaded and run by the user, it can dynamically load additional codeincluding the exploit, which is then used to escalate permissions and install the RCSAndroid backdoor. Its not clear how large a threat the Hacking Team version of this exploit posedit required the targeted phone to install the application, which would have required physical access to the phone or social engineering of its user.

## Hacking Team hackers questioned over Hacking Team hack

- 

- Reports have emerged that ex-staff of hacked spookware-spaffer Hacking Team have been questioned by police in Milan. According to Reuters, Italian police have questioned six ex-employees of the company, adding that the unnamed staff in question were already suspected of leaking the companys secrets.

- Spookeware boss David Vincenzetti had filed a complaint in May that the six had revealed part of the companys source code, the report states. Investigations into both the commercial secrets complaint and the more recent hack have now been combined into a single investigation. Since the 400GB of data exfiltrated from Hacking Team was leaked, and then indexed by Wikileaks, governments around the world have come under fire for dealing with the company. Its emerged that the outfits malware included a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) BIOS rootkit to make itself pretty much ineradicable. The hack and code leak has left companies like Oracle, Adobe and Microsoft scrambling to plug zero-day vulnerabilities that Hacking Team thought it had all to itself. The company had claimed that the hack hadnt exposed all of its crown jewels, but over the weekend, Twitter user @v1ad_ao claimed to have gotten the Hacking Team RCS compiled and running:  Hacking Team RCS up and running = Its going to be a busy weekend digging through this @sensepost pic.twitter.com/IgftqXToBs  vlad (@v1ad_o) July 16, 2015 He said the RCS interface runs on Adobe Air with a connection to a database running on a separate instance.

- So why is that public URL more secure than it looks?

- Photos URLs are typically around 40 characters long, so if you wanted to scan all the possible combinations, youd have to work through 1070 different combinations to get the right one, a problem on an astronomical scale.

- There are enough combinations that its considered unguessable, says Aravind Krishnaswamy, an engineering lead on Google Photos.

## Fragmented Android development creating greater security risks

- However, the security implications of this practice are less known, particularly when it comes to the changes made to Androids Linux device drivers, such as those for camera, GPS, NFC etc.

- Our study is based on ADDICTED, a new tool we built for automatically detecting some types of flaws in customised driver protection.

- Using the tool, we analyzed three popular phones from Samsung, identified their likely flaws and built end-to-end attacks that allow an unprivileged app to take pictures and screenshots, and even log the keys the user enters through touchscreen.

- For example, a talk by Ohad Bobrovand Avi Bashan at the Black Hat conference in Vegas next month draws heavily on the research of Xiaoyong Zhou et al.

- Both Bobrovand Bashan worked for Lacoon Mobile Security before moving to Check Point. El Reg approached Xiaoyong Zhou, who took time out to bring us up to speed on his work. We have reported all vulnerabilities to Samsung and Google, the report includes 69 phone models that contain vulnerabilities allow unauthorised apps to take screenshots, key logger and use the camera without user consent, Zhou explained. Samsung awarded us with a Samsung Note phone to show its acknowledgement.

## Firm stops selling exploits after delivering Flash 0-day to Hacking Team

- An e-mail sent in March and leaked by one or more people who compromisedHacking Team networks, however, showed Netragard CEO Adriel Desautels arranging the sale of an exploit that worked against fully patched versions of Adobes Flash media player.

- Hacking Team in turn has sold surveillance and exploit software to a variety of repressive governments, including Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. Our motivation for termination revolves around ethics, politics, and our primary business focus, Desautels wrote in a blog post published Friday.

- He went on to praise the use of zero-day exploits in certain cases, such as one from 2013 used to de-annonymize visitors to a child pornography site who used the Tor privacy service to hide their IP addresses.

- 0-day vulnerabilities exist in all major bits of software and if the good-guys arent allowed to find them then the bad-guys will. As Ars recently reported, the US and 40 other countries are considering updating the Wassenaar Arrangement to tightly control the export of exploit code.

- These tests are designed to identify vulnerabilities as well as paths to compromise and help to facilitate solid protective plans for our customers. It is important to mention that we are still in strong favor of ethical 0-day development, brokering and sales.

## Spyware-spewing Wi-Fi drone found on Hacking Team, Boeing's todo list

- Putting the plan together would involve developing a ruggedized and miniaturized Tactical Network Injector (TNI), Hacker News reports.

- Malicious traffic injection would only work in this scenario in cases where a target is surfing in an insecure, open Wi-Fi hotspot (coffee shop, transport hub, etc.)

- The email exchanges outlining the plan were first reported by Glenn Greenwalds The Intercept here. The idea of combining spyware and drones may not in itself be new.

## Hacking Team goes to war against former employees, suspects some helped hackers

- The leaked cache includes hundreds of gigabytes of company e-mails as well as some of its source code; the police allegedly suspect the involvement of former company insiders. According to Reuters, the new criminal inquiry is in addition to the fact that the before the hack, several former employeeswere being privately accusedofallegedly violating their contracts and using secrets to benefit competitors. Ive read in the press that Im being sued, I have also read the conversation between Vincenzetti and his lawyers about suing me, former senior developer GuidoLanditold Ars Monday morning.

- Controversy over the companys clients continued to escalate.In early November 2013, some Anonymous protestors even broke into the Hacking Team offices. And from that point, they started to have physical security, there werecameras in the entrance and you needed a badge, Pelliccione said.

- Before that you didnt need it except a padlock and a key to get into the office. Hecalled the then-management at Hacking Team oppressive. I think that part of the reason was to avoid generating debates and discussions internally of who the customers were, Pelliccione continued.

- The company later sued Woon in Singapore. Alex Velasco, who held a similar sales position in Washington, DC, was fired by Hacking Team after accusations of conflict of interest and breach of contract.

- If you know how Reaqta works, we do behavioral analysis, Theres not specific or proprietary information that we use for malware, it is generic and it is across the board. Woon doesnt feel sorry for all the chaos facing Hacking Team in light of therecent breach (and why would he, given the potential lawsuit).

## Ashley Madison invites red-faced cheats to bolt stable door for free

- Adulterous hook-up site Ashley Madison is allowing all members to fully delete their profiles without charge in the aftermath of a serious data breach that threatens the site future. Previously, if users wanted to delete their records (profile, pictures and messages sent through the system) they were obliged to pay around $20, but that money-spinner has been dropped in the wake of a hack that placed Ashley Madisons members in danger of exposure.

- The Impact Team characterises members of Ashley Madison as cheating dirtbags who deserve no privacy, bragging that they are poised to release info on many rich and powerful people unless their demands are met. Will Gragido, head of threat intelligence research at Digital Shadows, suspects the motive of the attacks might ultimately move towards ransoming off stolen information.

- Certain types of data and online behaviour are simply too attractive for blackmail purposes, and adversaries know the power of psychology and emotions when making demands like this. Notably, this incident seems even more extortion-focused than the Adult Friend Finder (AFF) breach case, because stolen AFF data was evident in underground cybercrime forums relatively soon.We see comparatively little Ashley Madison data in circulation, suggesting the attackers want to hold as much as they can for ransom, he added. Gragido noted that demands by the hackers that Ashley Madison ought to be shut down is a potentially ominous evolution in hacker strategy. What is most striking about this incident is the attackers demand that the business of Ashley Madison itself shut down, said Gragido. This is very ominous because it takes us down a slippery slope: What type of business will adversaries deem objectionable next, and demand its closure, in addition to holding its customers hostage with their stolen, personal information? Speculation is rife that an insider or former employee may have facilitated the hack. Luke Brown, vice president  GM EMEA at Digital Guardian, commented:The breach is suspected to be an inside job by someone involved with ALMs technical services, highlighting the critical need for good cybersecurity capable of mitigating this typeof insider threat. As it stands, the breach will likely cause irreparable damage to Ashley Madison as a business, he added. Ashley Madison is simultaneously one of themost popular dating websiteson the net, and the one its users are least likely to openly admit to using, for obvious reasons. Tod Beardsley, security engineering manager at Rapid7, the firm behind Metasploit, commented: Dating sites also host millions of intensely private scraps of user data.

- Users of these services may routinely share risqu photos, checklists of sexual preferences, and patterns of romantic activity that they consider deeply personal. Because of this, any breach involving a dating site comes with a built-in ickiness factor.

- The hackers are demanding the company to shut down or face public release of the very personal details of all of its 37 million customers. This puts AM between a rock and a hard place if it continues to operate.

## Jeep drivers can be HACKED to DEATH: All you need is the car's IP address

- The two researchers have demonstrated that a canny hacker can use the uConnect system to get wireless access to major components of a cars controls, and potentially physically crash it remotely with no one being any the wiser.

- Miller says the hack will work on recent Fiat Chrysler motors  such as Ram, Durango, and Jeep models.

- The fix is supposed to stop miscreants from accessing critical systems via the cellular network, a protection mechanism you would have expected in place on day one, week one. In short, make sure your cars software is up to date; check your manual for details on obtaining the latest firmware. Miller and Valasek have spent years investigating car computer security, sometimes funded by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

- This legislation will set minimum standards and transparency rules to protect the data, security, and privacy of drivers in the modern age of increasingly connected vehicles. The legislation would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Trade Commission to establish a basic set of security standards that lock off critical systems, like steering and engine power, to ensure that they cant be remotely controlled. These would come into effect two years after the legislation is passed and would be tested regularly by penetration experts to ensure that the security is current and practical.

- There would be a $5,000 fine for each violation of security standards. In addition, the bill would require manufacturers to take reasonable steps to protect the data collected on a drivers habits from being slurped.

## Get root on an OS X 10.10 Mac: The exploit is so trivial it fits in a tweet

- Code dive You can bypass Apples space-age security and gain administrator-level privileges on an OS X Yosemite Mac using code that fits in a tweet. Yosemite, aka version 10.10, is the latest stable release of the Mac operating system, so a lot of people are affected by this vulnerability.

- The security bug can be exploited by a logged-in attacker or malware on the computer to gain total unauthorized control of the Mac.

- It specifies where in the file system a component of the operating system called the dynamic linker can log error messages. If the environment variable is abused with a privileged program, an attacker can modify arbitrary files owned by the powerful user account root  files like the one that lists user accounts that are allowed administrator privileges. Heres the titchy root-level privilege-escalation exploit, devised yesterday by Redditor Numinit:  echo echo $(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL 3 | DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE=/etc/sudoers newgrp; sudo -s # via reddit: numinit (shorter)  Stefan Esser (@i0n1c) July 22, 2015 These shell commands run whoami to output your username (eg: vulture) and then tacks ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL on the end to form a line like:  vulture ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL  It then outputs that line to the file specified by DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE, which in this case is the list of users who can gain root-level privileges: /etc/sudoers.

- That line tells OS X that your user account is allowed to gain root privileges without a password. A privileged program  the root-owned set-uid executable newgrp  is run to provide the root-level access to the sudoers file.

- Finally, sudo -s is executed to open an interactive command-line shell, which will have root-level privileges for your user account thanks to the update to the sudoers file.

## Hark, the Hacking Team angels sing, its not us whove actually sinned

- The Hacking Team pushed out a new statement on Wednesday, moaning that the only victim of the mega-breach against its systems is Hacking Team itself. Eric Rabe, the firms chief marketing and communications officer, complained that the controversial outfit is being treated as the offender, and the criminals who attacked the company are not.

- Commentators dislike the fact that strong tools are needed to fight crime and terrorism, and Hacking Team provides them, Rabe said before going on to claim that the controversial Italian firm has operated within the law, and all regulation at all times.  The company complies with new regulation developed in 2014 and enacted in January 2015.

- Under this new regulation, Italy reviews all sales of Hacking Team technology in accordance with European Union and Wassenaar Arrangement requirements.

- The statement backs up earlier protestations that Hacking Team were on the side of angels, albeit deeply misunderstood. Critics have not been short of ammunition to fire back at Hacking Team in contesting these complaints, and advancing the counterargument that HT is little short of a menace to internet security while its business conduct has been ethically and morally questionable. Even before the breach of Hacking Teams systems and the release of more than 400GB of code, internal documents and emails revealed that the firm used undisclosed software vulnerabilities to plant its spyware on vulnerable systems. Three Hacking Team zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash, two in Microsoft Windows kernel, and one in IE have been exposed by the leak so far. The leak also revealed that Hacking Team created a firmware backdoor that stayed on infected systems even after victims replaced their hard drives.

- Source code and other leaked data have facilitated the release of Hacking Team spyware detection tools by Rook and Facebook. Sales of spyware tech to Sudan or Ethiopia, in particular, and its subsequent use in the latter case to track journalists in the US are difficult to justify morally. Elsewhere, a Hacking Team-related spying scandal is unfolding in South Korea after an employee of South Koreas spy agency was found dead in his car with a will reportedly mentioning Hacking Teams Remote Control System technology. Its known that South Korea was a client of Hacking Team but how it used this technology is beset by rival claims. Government sources claimed it was used to hack suspected agents of Pyongyang outside the country while the main opposition party suspects it was used to spy of South Korea citizens, the South Korean Yonhap News Agency reports.

## Hacking Team may not have had a backdoor, but it could kill client installs

- The truth is that the company itself has operated within the law and all regulation at all times. However, commentators dislike the fact that strong tools are needed to fight crime and terrorism, and Hacking Team provides them.

- Had a media company been attacked as Hacking Team has been, the press would be outraged. However, Ars is unaware of any secretive media companies that sell surveillance software to nefarious governments around the globe. Since it was breached, Hacking Team has tried to maintain a brave public image, saying that it is poised to release a new version of its Remote Control System to governments.

- However, since its e-mails have been published to WikiLeaks and its source code and other data published elsewhere, it seems quite difficult for the company to recover, particularly given that all of its customers have been told to shut down the software. Still, Hacking Teams press release continues to maintain that important elements of its source code were not compromised. The companyfurther re-iterated that all deals it made were strictly within the law and regulation as it applied at the time any sale was made, including reported sales to Ethiopia, Sudan, Russia, South Korea, and all other countries. As Ars reported recently, the companys sales to the FSB are likely in violation of European regulations. 4Armed Still, Greenwood told Ars that he has been impressed with the softwares design. The Galileo Remote Control System has a very solid back-end which provides redundancy and scalability along with a good evidence management and viewing system, he told Ars.The system of anonymizers works well, although requiring a large amount of effort to maintain.

- They have moderately sophisticated hiding mechanisms, including both rootkits and UEFI persistence, but this is let down by a very obvious and noisy network signature.

- Obviously Hacking Team assume that their targets will not be looking at the network traffic emanating from their computers, but would be disconcerted to see agent.exe appear in their Task Managers.

## ProxyGambit Better Than ProxyHam; Takes Coffee Shop WiFi Global

-  Last weekend saw the announcement of ProxyHam, a device that anonymizes Internet activity by jumping on WiFi from public libraries and cafes over a 900MHz radio link.

- No one knows why, but we spent some time speculating on that and on what hardware was actually used in the undisclosed build. [Samy Kamkar] has just improved on the ProxyHam concept with ProxyGambit, a device that decouples your location from your IP address.

- ProxyGambit can work anywhere on the planet over a 2G connection, or up to 10km (6 miles) away through a line-of-sight point to point wireless link. The more GSM version of ProxyGambit uses two Adafruit FONA GSM breakout boards, two Arduinos, and two Raspberry Pis.

- By reverse tunneling a TCP connection through the throwaway part of the build, [Samy] can get an Internet connection anywhere that has 2G service. Although its just a proof of concept and should not be used by anyone who actually needs anonymity, the ProxyGambit does have a few advantages over the ProxyHam.

- Its usable just about everywhere on the planet, and not just within two miles of the public WiFi access point.

## Hacking Team: a zero-day market case study

- He has reported dozens of bugs, primarily in browser components, to iDefense's Vulnerability Contributor Program and HP's Zero Day Initiative since 2011.

- But because of miscommunication and Hacking Team's wariness to embrace a new payment scheme that did not ensure a warranty, his payments were split. Exploits: Vitaliy's initial portfolio, which he presented to Hacking Team towards the end of 2013, consisted of three Flash RCEs (2 UaFs, 1 32-bit only integer overflow), two Safari RCEs (one only affected older versions of OS X/iOS), and a Silverlight RCE.

- SunSSHD remote roots or an OpenPAM local privilege escalation. After combing through the Hacking Team archive, there are two points that stuck out to me on the topic of corroborating commonly held security intuitions.

- (This is not surprising given the widely-spread rumors about iOS 0day-exploit chains fetching over a quarter million dollars each, but it's reassuring knowing that their exclusivity puts them out of range of second-rate surveillance contractors like Hacking Team.)

- The inclusion of 'intrusion software' in the recently proposed changes to the Wassenaar Arrangement is a direct consequence of the backlash against surveillance companies like Hacking Team and Gamma International selling their products to repressive regimes.

## Hackers Remotely Kill a Jeep on the HighwayWith Me in It

- I was driving 70 mph on the edge of downtown St. Louis when the exploit began to take hold. Though I hadnt touched the dashboard, the vents in the Jeep Cherokee started blasting cold air at the maximum setting, chilling the sweat on my back through the in-seat climate control system.

- In the summer of 2013, I drove a Ford Escape and a Toyota Prius around a South Bend, Indiana, parking lot while they sat in the backseat with their laptops, cackling as they disabled my brakes, honked the horn, jerked the seat belt, and commandeered the steering wheel.

- They demonstrated as much on the same day as my traumatic experience on I-64; After narrowly averting death by semi-trailer, I managed to roll the lame Jeep down an exit ramp, re-engaged the transmission by turning the ignition off and on, and found an empty lot where I could safely continue the experiment. Miller and Valaseks full arsenal includes functions that at lower speeds fully kill the engine, abruptly engage the brakes, or disable them altogether.

- Theyve only tested their full set of physical hacks, including ones targeting transmission and braking systems, on a Jeep Cherokee, though they believe that most of their attacks could be tweaked to work on any Chrysler vehicle with the vulnerable Uconnect head unit.

- The answers, released in February, show what Markey describes as a clear lack of appropriate security measures to protect drivers against hackers who may be able to take control of a vehicle. Of the 16 automakers who responded, all confirmed that virtually every vehicle they sell has some sort of wireless connection, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular service, and radios.

## [1507.05724v1] HORNET: High-speed Onion Routing at the Network Layer

-   We present HORNET, a system that enables high-speed end-to-end anonymous channels by leveraging next generation network architectures.

- HORNET is designed as a low-latency onion routing system that operates at the network layer thus enabling a wide range of applications.

- Our system uses only symmetric cryptography for data forwarding yet requires no per-flow state on intermediate nodes.

- This design enables HORNET nodes to process anonymous traffic at over 93 Gb/s.

- HORNET can also scale as required, adding minimal processing overhead per additional anonymous channel.

## Feds bust through huge Tor-hidden child porn site using questionable malware

- Ferrell, username plowden23, is the target of the search warrant affidavit. Schreiber, 66, of Queens, was a former New York City schoolteacher. The two New York men have been released on bond.

- The setup was seized in February 2015, but law enforcement allowed it to run for two additional weeks as a way to monitor its nearly 215,000 users.

- during an interview with law enforcement officers, defendant PAROLINE admitted that while working at a nursery school and a summer camp counselor in New Jersey, he inappropriately touched minor children.

- Operation Torpedo relied on long-abandoned Metasploit Decloaking Engine.

## Dear NY Times, if you're going to hack people, at least do it cleanly! - webrtcHacks

- Lets look at the technical details... it turns out that the Javascript code used is very clunky and inefficient. First thing to do is to check chrome://webrtc-internals (my favorite tool since the hangouts analysis).

- We can see a peerconnection created with the RtpDataChannels argument set to true and using stun:ph.tagsrvcs.com as a STUN server. Also, we see that a data channel is created, followed by calls to createOffer and setLocalDescription.

- It is creating a peerconnection with the optional RtpDataChannels constraint set to true.

- From Wireshark dumps its pretty easy to figure out that this is running the [coturn stun/turn server](https://code.google.com/p/coturn/); the SOFTWARE field in the binding response is set to Coturn-4.4.2.k3 Ardee West. The code hooks up the onicecandidate callback and inspects every candidate it gets.

- Also, looking for the candidate lines in the localDescription.sdp will not yield any new information as any candidate found in there will also be signalled in the onicecandidate callback (unless someone is using a 12+ months old version of Firefox). Since the JS is minified it is rather hard to trace what actually happens with those IPs. If youre going to hack people, at least do it cleanly! {author: Philipp Hancke} Want to keep up on our latest posts?

## A Overview of Hacking Teams Leaked Data - Drops

- src="http://static.wooyun.org//drops/20150707/2015070723045563665.png"/>So we will explain the details according to the category they belong to in the following chapters. 0x02 Android 1 core-Android-audiocapture-master.zip mainly uses the hook framework created by Collin Mulliner to conduct voice and call monitoring.

- It seems that the app not only monitors telephone calls, but also intercepts the audios on wechat, whatsapp and skype. 2 core-Android-market-master.zip is a projects used to upload a spy tool to Google Play.

- src="http://static.wooyun.org//drops/20150707/2015070723045536147.png"/>Please enter image description. In terms of application reinforcement, the RCS app has used DexGuard for obfuscation and virtual machine detection techniques.

- src="http://static.wooyun.org//drops/20150707/2015070723045523551.png"/>In addition, core-android-master\RCSAndroid\jni\selinux_exploit contains the exploit to bypass the SELinux enforcing mode. 4 core-Android-native-master.zip contains more specific root projects and descriptions in the "legacy_native" folder: Suidext contains all of the shells.

- It mainly uses dylib injection to monitor user input, GPS and the screen information. Android ADB backup APK injection vulnerability discovered by and POC created by Imre Rad, SEARCH-LAB Ltd., Hungary.

- By default, full backup of applications including the private files stored in /data is performed, but this behaviour can be customized by implementing a BackupAgent class.

- The backup manager, which invokes the custom BackupAgent does not filter the data stream returned by the applications.

- Later they kept requesting to hold off publishing as they needed more time for further investigation, but as of today, July 8, 2015 the bug was still not addressed.

- Couple of additional emails in this thread, Google kept investigating the issue and requested holding off the publication
