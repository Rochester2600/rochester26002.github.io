## Turns Out That Snaps Are Not Secure In Ubuntu With X11

-  Turns Out That Snaps Are Not Secure In Ubuntu With X11  (softpedia.com) 

- prisoninmate quotes a report from Softpedia: According to Matthew Garrett, a renowned CoreOS security developer, and Linux kernel contributor, Canonical's new snap package format is not secure at all when it is used under X.Org Server (X Window System), which, for now, it is still the default display server of the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) operating system.

- The fact of the matter is that X11's old design is well-known for being insecure, and Matthew Garrett took the time to demonstrate this by writing a simple snap package that can steal data from any other X11 software, in this case anything you type on the Mozilla Firefox web browser.

- As more developers will provide snaps for their apps, Canonical needs to do something about the security of snaps in Ubuntu when using X11 or switch to the Mir display server.

- In the meantime, the security of snaps remains unaffected for the Ubuntu Server operating system, which is usually used without a display server. Canonical has officially released Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, which is now available to download for those interested.

## Over 1 Million People Use Tor To Check Facebook Anonymously Each Month

- An anonymous reader writes: More than one million people have used the Tor anonymizing browser to login to Facebook, according to Facebook.

- Facebook expanded its support for Tor earlier this year as it rolled-out support for the Android Orbot proxy, providing Android Facebook users easier access to use Tor.

- In October 2014, Facebook created a dedicated onion address for Tor access, once again, making it easier for users to connect via Tor.

- We hope they will continue to provide feedback and help us keep improving," Facebook added.

- Users may use Tor to access Facebook because of the location obfuscation feature, as well as to ensure their identity doesn't leak to intermediaries -- such as ISPs or "an agency that surveils the Internet.

## A Majority Of Millennials Now Reject Capitalism, Poll Shows

- A new poll shows that a majority of young people do not support capitalism.

- The study was conducted by Harvard University, which polled young adults ages 18-29.

- It found that 51 percent of those polled rejected capitalism, that is to say, they did not support it.

- Only 42 percent said they support capitalism -- there was a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points.

- It does appear to suggest young people are frustrated with the status quo and are more focused on the flaws of free markets.

## Can Quantum Entanglement Create Faster-Than-Light Communication?

- Slashdot reader StartsWithABang writes: If you were to send a space probe to a distant star system, gather information about it and send it back to Earth, you'd have to wait years for the information to arrive.

-   This "incredible idea to exploit quantum weirdness" for communication was the subject of a recent Forbes article [which blocks ad-blockers] as well as a NASA mission directorate.

- ("Entanglement-assisted Communication System for NASA's Deep-Space Missions: Feasibility Test and Conceptual Design".)

- And Friday MIT News reported a research team is now making progress toward capturing paired electron halves for quantum computing on gold film.

-   This week even 85-year-old Star Trek actor William Shatner cited quantum entanglement in a discussion of Star Trek's transporter technology, arguing that "Although a lot of the concepts in science fiction are absurd to our Newtonian minds, anything is possible because of the new language of quantum physics.

## Shors Algorithm In Five Atoms

- Each qubit is an atom and LASER pulses perform the logic operations. By removing an electron to make each atom positively charged, an electric field can exactly hold the positively charged ions in position only microns apart.

- If you want to factor a number, one way to do it is Shors algorithm.

- However, recent work at MIT and the University of Innsbruck can do the same trick with 5 atoms caught in an ion trap.

## The U.S. just labeled Switzerland an internet piracy haven

- The Office of the United States Trade Representative [USTR] has published its annual Special 301 Report calling out other nations for failing to live up to U.S. IP enforcement standards, reports Andy at TorrentFreak. This year, European ally Switzerland has been placed on the Watch List for protecting file-sharers and playing host to many pirate sites.

## DRAM bitflipping exploits that hijack computers just got easier

- New research into the "Rowhammer" bug that resides in certain types of DDR memory chips raises a troubling new prospect: attacks that use Web applications or booby-trapped videos and documents to trigger so-called bitflipping exploits that allow hackers to take control of vulnerable computers.

- attackers could take advantage of media players, file readers, file compression utilities, or other apps already installed on Rowhammer-susceptible machines and cause the apps to trigger the attacks.

- given recent findings that the bug extends to DDR4 memory, not just DDR3 as previously believed, there's reason for measured concern

## Facebook's own TLS cert used by crooks in double logon phish

- Netcraft security man Paul Mutton says phishers are using Facebook's TLS certificate to create a 'remarkably convincing' scam that would go unnoticed by most users. The phish uses an iframe to serve a Facebook verification form, but that form isn't from The Social NetworkTM.

- Instead, the form comes from an external Hostgator site that uses HTTPS and Facebook's certificate.  

- That combination means browsers don't warn users of the impending danger. Once users log in from the form in the iframe form, a second fake login form appears claiming that the details into the first fake form were incorrect.

- Users are prompted to log in again. A login successful page appears after the user has submitted their details for the second time claiming that the victim will receive a verification approval email within the next 24 hours. "Fraudsters are abusing Facebook's app platform to carry out some remarkably convincing phishing attacks against Facebook users," Mutton says. "To win over anyone who remains slightly suspicious, the phishing site always pretends that the first set of submitted credentials were incorrect.

- " Users should alter their security settings to enable login approvals that ask for two-factor authentication whenever logins occur from unknown origins.

## Office 365 Flaw Allowed Anyone To Log In To Almost Any Business Account

- A severe vulnerability in the way Microsoft Office 365 handles federated identities via SAML put an attacker in a position to have access to any account and data, including emails and files stored in the cloud-based service. Microsoft pushed through a mitigation to the service on Jan. 5, seven hours after being notified by researchers Yiannis Kakavas and Klemen Bratec. "The attack surface was quite big (Outlook Online, OneDrive, Skype for Business, OneNote -- depending on what the company has paid for in terms of licensing)," Kakavas and Bratec told Threatpost via email. "And a malicious user exploiting this vulnerability could have gained access to very sensitive private and company information (emails, internal documents etc. )." Office 365 users who had configured domains as federated were affected. The list includes British Airways, Microsoft, Vodafone, Verizon and many others, as mentioned in a report published late Wednesday.

## Algorithmic Improvements Give Bitcoin Mining an AsicBoost

- Through parallel processing, it re-uses outputs that would otherwise be created and discarded on a continuous basis. Furthermore, it achieves gains on top of other optimizations such as timing, pipelining, path balancing, custom cell and full custom designs.The new technology is a result of algorithmic discoveries that were widely believed to be impossible, allowing for a reduction in chip silicon area and lower power consumption by using fewer gates for each hashing core.

- Considered an arms race as each hash-share gain increases profits at the expense of competitors, competition is intense, with hardware constantly improved and older versions quickly becoming obsolete.A dramatic illustration can be seen during a three-month period between December 2015 to March 2016 when difficulty more than doubled from 75 petahash to 175 petahash, more than halving the reward for mining hardware in use during December 2015.

- Jihan Wu, cofounder of Bitmain, one of the largest mining pools and home of the recently announced Antminer S7, told Bitcoin Magazine that the level of profitability depends on electricity prices as well as the cost of mining rigs, but he could not provide specific numbers.

- BitFury recently announced an investment in BitPesa for an undisclosed amount as well as a new project to build a blockchain-based property registry having previously donated $100,000 to MITs Digital Currency Initiative developers fund, according to Alex Petrov of BitFury who told Bitcoin Magazine that it was BitFurys initiative to create the fund which supports Bitcoin developers.

- With mining revenue dependent on the strength of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and as its profits grow through efficiency gains, we may expect more investments and diversification.

## Facebook Paid $10,000 To A 10-Year-Old For Hacking Instagram

- An anonymous reader writes: Facebook has paid $10,000 to a 10-year-old hacker who discovered how one could hack into Instagram and delete comments made by users.

- Speaking to local publication Iltalehti, Jani said: "I would have been able to eliminate anyone, even Justin Bieber."

- The Finnish hacker just became the youngest person to receive cash from Facebook for hacking its products.

- What's funny is Jani isn't technically old enough to sign-up and use Facebook or Instagram, as it's supposed to be restricted to those under the age of 13.

- Facebook has received more than 2,400 valid submissions and awarded upwards of $4.3 million to over 800 researchers since the bounty program launched in 2011.

## Self-Driving Features Could Lead To More Sex In Moving Cars, Expert Warns

- An anonymous reader writes: According to CBC.ca, "At least one expert is anticipating that, as the so-called 'smart' cars get smarter, there will eventually be an increase in an unusual form of distracted driving: hanky-panky behind the wheel."

- Barrie Kirk of the Canadian Automated Vehicles Centre of Excellence said, "I am predicting that, once computers are doing the driving, there will be a lot more sex in cars.

- That's one of several things people will do which will inhibit their ability to respond quickly when the computer says to the human, 'Take over.'"

- Federal officials, who have been tasked with building a regulatory framework to govern driverless cars, highlighted their concerns in briefing notes compiled for Transport Minister Marc Garneau.

- The Tesla autopilot feature has been receiving the most criticism as there have been many videos posted online showing Tesla drivers engaged in questionable practices, including reading a newspaper or brushing their teeth.

## Aging and bloated OpenSSL is purged of 2 high-severity bugs

- Maintainers of the OpenSSL cryptographic library have patched high-severity holes that could make it possible for attackers to decrypt login credentials or execute malicious code on Web servers. The updates were released Tuesday morning for both versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 of OpenSSL, which a large portion of the Internet relies on to cryptographically protect sensitive Web and e-mail traffic using the transport layer security protocol.

- The fixes bring the latest supported versions to 1.0.1t and 1.0.2h. The decryption vulnerability is the result of what cryptographers call a padding oracle weakness, which allows attackers to repeatedly probe an encrypted payload for clues about the plaintext content inside.

- Still, the conditions might make it possible for an attacker with the ability to monitor the connection to obtain authentication cookies and other small chunks of encrypted text, Valsorda wrote.

- Valsorda said older TLS schemes remain widely used and could make as many as one in four connections vulnerable. The second high-severity bug causes memory corruptions, a weakness that may allow attackers to execute malicious code.

- There appear to be several other requirements that make exploitation difficult. The newly disclosed flaws are at least in part caused by OpenSSL's support of older encryption schemes that are no longer considered state of the art.

-  In Search Of A Healthy Gut, One Man Turned To An Extreme DIY Fecal Transplant  (theverge.com) 

- Josiah Zayner writes: Arielle Duhaime-Ross at The Verge followed Dr. Josiah Zayner, a former Scientist at NASA turned BioHacker, as he attempted the first ever full-body microbiome transplant.

- She writes "Over the course of the next four days, Zayner would attempt to eradicate the trillions of microbes that lived on and inside his body -- organisms that helped him digest food, produce vitamins and enzymes, and protected his body from other, more dangerous bacteria.

- Ruthlessly and methodically, he would try to render himself into a biological blank slate.

- Then, he would inoculate himself with a friend's microbes -- a procedure he refers to as a 'microbiome transplant.

## Serious ImageMagick Zero-Day Vulnerabilities  ImageTragick?

- At least this time its pretty dangerous, a bunch of ImageMagick Zero-Day vulnerabilities have been announced including one that can leave you susceptible to remote code execution.

- Of course if youre already smart and using a third party service to do it like Cloudinary or ImgIX  you are safe. A wildly popular software tool used by websites to process peoples photos can be exploited to execute malicious code on servers and leak server-side files. Security bugs in the software are apparently being exploited in the wild right now to compromise at-risk systems.

- Patches to address the vulnerabilities are available in the latest source code  but are incomplete and have not been officially released, were told. Whenever you upload a profile photo, a gallery of snaps, or a silly meme to a website, theres an extremely high chance that the site is using ImageMagick, an open-source collection of image processing tools, to resize, crop and tweak the pictures. By feeding booby-trapped data  such as a poisoned selfie  to web services using ImageMagick, it may be possible to execute malicious code on the websites server.

- From there hackers can start infiltrating the system to steal secrets, snoop on peoples accounts, and so on.  Source: The Register 

- It seems like the details leaked out before the proper patches could be developed, tested and rolled out  they are expected to come this weekend though. The flaw itself somehow seems to be related to these insecure delegates used by ImageMagick. How to Protect against it 1.

## NIST Starts Planning for Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Last year, the NSA announced its plans for transitioning to cryptography that is resistant to a quantum computer.

- A key part of this effort will be an open collaboration with the public, which will be invited to devise and vet cryptographic methods that -- to the best of experts' knowledge -- will be resistant to quantum attack.

- NIST plans to launch this collaboration formally sometime in the next few months, but in general, Moody says it will resemble past competitions such as the one for developing the SHA-3 hash algorithm, used in part for authenticating digital messages.

- The report rightly states that we're okay in the symmetric cryptography world; the key lengths are long enough.

- NIST has done an excellent job with their previous cryptographic standards, giving us a couple of good, strong, well-reviewed, and patent-free algorithms.

## Boffins achieve 'breakthrough' in random number generation

- Researchers have devised a method of generating random numbers that could shake up computer encryption. University of Texas computer science professor David Zuckerman and PhD student Eshan Chattopadhyay have found that a "high-quality" random number could be generated by combining two "low-quality" random sources.  

- You can read their report, Explicit Two-Source Extractors and Resilient Functions, here. Random number generation is used for a variety of applications including cryptography and scientific modelling. Zuckerman is quoted in Threatpost saying: "We show that if you have two low-quality random sources  lower-quality sources are much easier to come by  two sources that are independent and have no correlations between them, you can combine them in a way to produce a high-quality random number.

- Low-quality sources are less random and more vulnerable to security breaches if they are used in encryption. Cryptographic algorithms attempt to keep information secret by transforming it into a stream of random numbers, making it unintelligible.

- Their paper has caught the attention of other academics worldwide who have described the research as "pulse-quickening" and "a breakthrough in theoretical computer science.

- " Zuckerman and Chattopadhyay will present their paper at the Symposium on Theory of Computing in June.

## Anti-Choice Groups Use Smartphone Surveillance to Target 'Abortion-Minded Women' During Clinic Visits - Rewire

- He put together PowerPoint presentations touting his capabilities, and sent them to groups he thought would be interested in reaching abortion-minded women, to use anti-choice parlance. Before long, hed been hired by RealOptions, a network of crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) in Northern California, as well as by the evangelical adoption agency Bethany Christian Services. Flynns endeavors quickly won him attention in the anti-choice world.

- Marketers likely know your age, gender, occupation, education level, marital status, andif you have GPS enabled on your phone and are logged into apps that track youwhere you live, work, and travel. What Flynn realized is that he could use the same technologies to infer that a woman might be seeking an abortion, and to target her for ads from anti-choice groups. We can reach every Planned Parenthood in the U.S., he wrote in a PowerPoint display sent to potential clients in February.

- The chain has faced accusations of pressuring birth moms to continue pregnancies against their will, of abandoning mothers who change their minds and decide not to go through with adoptions, and other abuses. The social worker who received Flynns pitch deck told Rewire she was alarmed that Flynn had succeeded in reaching so many women on behalf of his anti-choice clients. Hes doing it and its working and its probably really impacting human trajectories, she said.

- RealOptions in the San Jose area is presently targeting colleges and medical centers without issue. In the absence of robust legal limitations in the United States, advertisers have organized into self-regulatory bodies to police themselves, acutely conscious that examples of egregious privacy violations could spark a public backlash, and lead consumers to block ads and to opt out of targeted marketing. Michael Uehlein, a spokesman from the Direct Marketing Association (DMA)a New York-based group that represents direct marketerssaid in an email statement to Rewire: A key pillar of DMAs work is to ensure that data-driven marketers conduct their work on an ethical basis, respecting the private information of consumers.

- The number of young women identifying with socialist principles suggests many potential readers would appreciate an explicit discussion of alternatives to capitalist feminismbeyond equal pay, what about basic income?but Zeisler largely avoids this conversation, instead alluding more broadly to the need for a post-marketplace-feminism world. In the end, the books greatest weakness is that it sidelines todays grassroots feminist and intersectional social movements, many of which oppose capitalism.

## EFF Applauds Jury Verdict in Favor of Fair Use in Oracle V. Google

- This verdict comes after an earlier district court opinion finding the API labels in question uncopyrightable was reversed by the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. The Google verdict is an an important validation of the idea that developing interoperable software need not require permission or a license.

- As Google attorney Robert Van Nest said in his closing arguments, the law expressly endorses fair useit's a right, not an "excuse," as Oracle attorneys had claimed. Still, the fair use victory is bittersweet.

- The Federal Circuit decision to reverse that opinion was not just wrong but dangerous.

- While developers of interoperable software can take some comfort in the fact that reimplementation may be fair use, a simpler and fairer solution would simply have been to recognize API labels as a system or method of operation not restricted by copyright. The case is not yet closed.

- Oracle has announced that it will appeal the decisionat which point it will go back to the Federal Circuit, with a reported $9 billion still on the line.

## 12 more banks now being investigated over Bangladeshi SWIFT heist

- The investigation into the attempted $1 billion electronic heist at the Central Bank of Bangladesh has expanded to as many as 12 more banks that all use the SWIFT payment network. Security firm FireEye, investigating the hack, has been contacted by numerous other banks, including some in New Zealand and the Philippines.

- While most of the attempted transfers in the original heist were canceled, some $81 million was sent to the Philippines and subsequently laundered through casinos.

- The SWIFT organization in a statement said that some of these reports may be false positives and that banks should rigorously review their computing environments to look for hackers. Symantec, meanwhile, has corroborated earlier claims from BAE Systems that the hackers that stole from the Bangladesh Bank are linked to the hackers that have attacked targets in the US and South Korea since 2009 and that hacked Sony Pictures in 2014.

- The FBI claimed that those hackers were North Korean.

- Symantec's rationale is the same as that of BAE; malware found at the bank, Sony, and other victims, all appears to share common code for securely deleting files to cover its tracks. The continuing evidence of malicious access to the SWIFT network is putting increasing pressure on the industry-owned organization.

## Android Is 'Fair Use' As Google Beats Oracle In $9 Billion Lawsuit

- infernalC writes: Ars Technica is reporting that the verdict is in, and that the jury decided that Google's duplication of several Java interfaces is fair use. Ars Technica writes that Google's Android OS does not infringe upon Oracle-owned copyrights because its re-implementation of 37 Java APIs is protected by "fair use."

- The jury unanimously answered "yes" in response to whether or not Google's use of Java APIs was a "fair use" under copyright law.

- "Google's win somewhat softens the blow to software developers who previously thought programming language APIs were free to use," Ars Technica writes.

- "It's still the case that APIs can be protected by copyright under the law of at least one appeals court.

- However, the first high-profile attempt to control APIs with copyright law has now been stymied by a "fair use" defense."
