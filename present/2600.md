## Turns Out That Snaps Are Not Secure In Ubuntu With X11

-  Turns Out That Snaps Are Not Secure In Ubuntu With X11  (softpedia.com) 

- prisoninmate quotes a report from Softpedia: According to Matthew Garrett, a renowned CoreOS security developer, and Linux kernel contributor, Canonical's new snap package format is not secure at all when it is used under X.Org Server (X Window System), which, for now, it is still the default display server of the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) operating system.

- The fact of the matter is that X11's old design is well-known for being insecure, and Matthew Garrett took the time to demonstrate this by writing a simple snap package that can steal data from any other X11 software, in this case anything you type on the Mozilla Firefox web browser.

- As more developers will provide snaps for their apps, Canonical needs to do something about the security of snaps in Ubuntu when using X11 or switch to the Mir display server.

- In the meantime, the security of snaps remains unaffected for the Ubuntu Server operating system, which is usually used without a display server. Canonical has officially released Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, which is now available to download for those interested.

## Over 1 Million People Use Tor To Check Facebook Anonymously Each Month

- An anonymous reader writes: More than one million people have used the Tor anonymizing browser to login to Facebook, according to Facebook.

- Facebook expanded its support for Tor earlier this year as it rolled-out support for the Android Orbot proxy, providing Android Facebook users easier access to use Tor.

- In October 2014, Facebook created a dedicated onion address for Tor access, once again, making it easier for users to connect via Tor.

- We hope they will continue to provide feedback and help us keep improving," Facebook added.

- Users may use Tor to access Facebook because of the location obfuscation feature, as well as to ensure their identity doesn't leak to intermediaries -- such as ISPs or "an agency that surveils the Internet.

## A Majority Of Millennials Now Reject Capitalism, Poll Shows

- A new poll shows that a majority of young people do not support capitalism.

- The study was conducted by Harvard University, which polled young adults ages 18-29.

- It found that 51 percent of those polled rejected capitalism, that is to say, they did not support it.

- Only 42 percent said they support capitalism -- there was a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points.

- It does appear to suggest young people are frustrated with the status quo and are more focused on the flaws of free markets.

## Can Quantum Entanglement Create Faster-Than-Light Communication?

- Slashdot reader StartsWithABang writes: If you were to send a space probe to a distant star system, gather information about it and send it back to Earth, you'd have to wait years for the information to arrive.

-   This "incredible idea to exploit quantum weirdness" for communication was the subject of a recent Forbes article [which blocks ad-blockers] as well as a NASA mission directorate.

- ("Entanglement-assisted Communication System for NASA's Deep-Space Missions: Feasibility Test and Conceptual Design".)

- And Friday MIT News reported a research team is now making progress toward capturing paired electron halves for quantum computing on gold film.

-   This week even 85-year-old Star Trek actor William Shatner cited quantum entanglement in a discussion of Star Trek's transporter technology, arguing that "Although a lot of the concepts in science fiction are absurd to our Newtonian minds, anything is possible because of the new language of quantum physics.

## Shors Algorithm In Five Atoms

- Each qubit is an atom and LASER pulses perform the logic operations. By removing an electron to make each atom positively charged, an electric field can exactly hold the positively charged ions in position only microns apart.

- If you want to factor a number, one way to do it is Shors algorithm.

- However, recent work at MIT and the University of Innsbruck can do the same trick with 5 atoms caught in an ion trap.

## The U.S. just labeled Switzerland an internet piracy haven

- The Office of the United States Trade Representative [USTR] has published its annual Special 301 Report calling out other nations for failing to live up to U.S. IP enforcement standards, reports Andy at TorrentFreak. This year, European ally Switzerland has been placed on the Watch List for protecting file-sharers and playing host to many pirate sites.

## DRAM bitflipping exploits that hijack computers just got easier

- New research into the "Rowhammer" bug that resides in certain types of DDR memory chips raises a troubling new prospect: attacks that use Web applications or booby-trapped videos and documents to trigger so-called bitflipping exploits that allow hackers to take control of vulnerable computers.

- attackers could take advantage of media players, file readers, file compression utilities, or other apps already installed on Rowhammer-susceptible machines and cause the apps to trigger the attacks.

- given recent findings that the bug extends to DDR4 memory, not just DDR3 as previously believed, there's reason for measured concern

## Facebook's own TLS cert used by crooks in double logon phish

- Netcraft security man Paul Mutton says phishers are using Facebook's TLS certificate to create a 'remarkably convincing' scam that would go unnoticed by most users. The phish uses an iframe to serve a Facebook verification form, but that form isn't from The Social NetworkTM.

- That combination means browsers don't warn users of the impending danger. Once users log in from the form in the iframe form, a second fake login form appears claiming that the details into the first fake form were incorrect.

- Users are prompted to log in again. A login successful page appears after the user has submitted their details for the second time claiming that the victim will receive a verification approval email within the next 24 hours. "Fraudsters are abusing Facebook's app platform to carry out some remarkably convincing phishing attacks against Facebook users," Mutton says. "To win over anyone who remains slightly suspicious, the phishing site always pretends that the first set of submitted credentials were incorrect.

- " Users should alter their security settings to enable login approvals that ask for two-factor authentication whenever logins occur from unknown origins.

## Office 365 Flaw Allowed Anyone To Log In To Almost Any Business Account

- A severe vulnerability in the way Microsoft Office 365 handles federated identities via SAML put an attacker in a position to have access to any account and data, including emails and files stored in the cloud-based service. Microsoft pushed through a mitigation to the service on Jan. 5, seven hours after being notified by researchers Yiannis Kakavas and Klemen Bratec. "The attack surface was quite big (Outlook Online, OneDrive, Skype for Business, OneNote -- depending on what the company has paid for in terms of licensing)," Kakavas and Bratec told Threatpost via email. "And a malicious user exploiting this vulnerability could have gained access to very sensitive private and company information (emails, internal documents etc. )." Office 365 users who had configured domains as federated were affected. The list includes British Airways, Microsoft, Vodafone, Verizon and many others, as mentioned in a report published late Wednesday.

## Algorithmic Improvements Give Bitcoin Mining an AsicBoost

- Through parallel processing, it re-uses outputs that would otherwise be created and discarded on a continuous basis. Furthermore, it achieves gains on top of other optimizations such as timing, pipelining, path balancing, custom cell and full custom designs.The new technology is a result of algorithmic discoveries that were widely believed to be impossible, allowing for a reduction in chip silicon area and lower power consumption by using fewer gates for each hashing core.

- Considered an arms race as each hash-share gain increases profits at the expense of competitors, competition is intense, with hardware constantly improved and older versions quickly becoming obsolete.A dramatic illustration can be seen during a three-month period between December 2015 to March 2016 when difficulty more than doubled from 75 petahash to 175 petahash, more than halving the reward for mining hardware in use during December 2015.

- Jihan Wu, cofounder of Bitmain, one of the largest mining pools and home of the recently announced Antminer S7, told Bitcoin Magazine that the level of profitability depends on electricity prices as well as the cost of mining rigs, but he could not provide specific numbers.

- BitFury recently announced an investment in BitPesa for an undisclosed amount as well as a new project to build a blockchain-based property registry having previously donated $100,000 to MITs Digital Currency Initiative developers fund, according to Alex Petrov of BitFury who told Bitcoin Magazine that it was BitFurys initiative to create the fund which supports Bitcoin developers.

- With mining revenue dependent on the strength of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and as its profits grow through efficiency gains, we may expect more investments and diversification.

## Hacking Team CEO says the company lost 20% of customers after hack. But also says 4 new contracts recently signed httpst.coXuJoCBsYyx

- Frankly, the evidence that the Citizen Lab report presents in this case doesnt suggest anything inappropriately done by us, company spokesman Eric Rabe told the Globe and Mail. As media and activists speculated about which countries the Italian firm served, the founder and CEO of the Hacking Team, David Vincenzetti  from his sleek, white office inside an unsuspecting residential building in Milan  took the bad press in stride.

- He is nothing if not militant about what he defines as justice: Julian Assange, the embattled founder of WikiLeaks, is a criminal who by all means should be arrested, expatriated to the United States, and judged there; whistleblower Chelsea Manning is another lunatic; Edward Snowden should go to jail, absolutely. Privacy is very important, Vincenzetti says on a recent February morning in Milan, pausing to sip his espresso.

- Yet there are myriad options for delivery: a USB, DVD, public Wi-Fi network, or even a QR code disguised as something enticing (such as an ad for an escort service). In the early days, Vincenzetti framed the Hacking Team as important defenders of international security  a modern-day Justice League dreaming up technology that governments could use to protect their citizens.

- One protester shouted through a microphone, while others waved fliers with slogans like, United We Stand and #Stop Watching Us. Many of the demonstrators wore white plastic masks with wide smiles, rosy cheeks, and Van Dykes  the guise of Anonymous, the international collective of activists and hackers. According to Vincenzetti, who was in Rome at the time, the intruders stole whatever they could grab  papers, notes, personal items  while filming their invasion, which they later posted online.

- Writing in the IB Times, security analyst John McAfee described the hack as a uniquely monumental event that threatens to bring down a well-known name in the mass surveillance industry. The leak exposed a trove of customer invoices confirming links to repressive regimes, including Ethiopia, Bahrain, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Azerbaijan.

## NYPD anti-crypto Twitter campaign goes about as well as you'd expect

- A social media campaign by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and the Manhattan District Attorney to garner public support for forcing tech companies to install encryption backdoors has backfired spectacularly. "The debate over encryption is often referred to in terms of privacy and security, with little regard for the impact on crime victims," said District Attorney Cyrus Vance at the launch on Monday.  

- Juries don't just expect that  they demand it, and evidence that used to reside in file cabinets, closets, and safes is today stored on smartphones.

- So the law enforcement team launched #unlockjustice, a campaign to let the public scream their disapproval of end-to-end encryption.  Youtube Video  You can see where this is going.

- The response to the campaign has not been what the NYPD is looking for.  Strong crypto prevents serious crimes like identity theft, stalking, sabotage and espionage.

- But the NYPD is also facing allegations that it stole the #unlockjustice hashtag, as it was already in use by another campaign. The Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL), a Quaker lobbying group, has been using the #unlockjustice hashtag since last year to highlight excessive mandatory sentences being handed out for crimes. "They're obviously not very good at social media," FCNL spokesman Jim Cason told The Register.

## Researchers Can Identify You By Your Brain Waves With 100% Accuracy

- An anonymous reader writes: Scientists have developed a new system that can identify people using their brain waves or 'brainprint' with 100% accuracy, an advance that may be useful in high-security applications.

- Researchers at Binghamton University in U.S. recorded the brain activity of 50 people wearing an electroencephalogram (EEG) headset while they looked at a series of 500 images designed specifically to elicit unique responses from person to person -- e.g., a slice of pizza, a boat, or the word "conundrum."

- They found that participants' brains reacted differently to each image, enough that a computer system was able to identify each volunteer's 'brainprint' with 100% accuracy.

- "When you take hundreds of these images, where every person is going to feel differently about each individual one, then you can be really accurate in identifying which person it was who looked at them just by their brain activity," said Assistant Professor Sarah Laszlo. One thing the paper doesn't talk about is the effect of time on the accuracy of the system.

- People may perceive different things when looking at the same picture a year later, for instance.

## How hackers eavesdropped on a US Congressman using only his phone number

- A US Congressman has learned first-hand just how vulnerable cellphones are to eavesdropping and geographic tracking after hackers were able to record his calls and monitor his movements using nothing more than the public ten-digit phone number associated with the handset he used. The stalking of US Representative Ted Lieu's smartphone was carried out with his permission for a piece broadcast Sunday night by 60 Minutes.

- Karsten Nohl of Germany-based Security Research Labs was able to record any call made to or from the phone and to track its precise location in real-time as the California congressman traveled to various points in the southern part of the state.

- The assumption is that if the phone is located in the same place as a transaction, there's a good chance the card holder is traveling there and it's safe to approve the transaction. "As long as you have SS7 access, it's extremely easy," Les Goldsmith, a researcher with Las Vegas security firm ESD, told Ars.

- As a result, the person on the receiving end would have no clue the communication is being intercepted or routed through a switch controlled by a third party. While many carriers say they're in the process of replacing SS7 to a more secure protocol known as Diameter, Goldsmith said it will likely remain backward-compatible with its predecessor for many years.

- For instance, a query coming from a Russia-based telco seeking the location of a known official with the US Pentagon might be automatically dropped. According to 60 Minutes, the abuse of SS7 to snoop and eavesdrop on smartphone users is an open secret among the NSA and other intelligence agencies.

## Stealing 3D Prints By Sound

-  In the open hardware world, we like to share 3D design files so that our friends and (global) neighbors can use and improve them.

- At least this is the premise behind this article in Science which proposes a novel method of 3D-printer-based industrial espionage: by recording the sound of the stepper motors and re-creating the toolpath. Unfortunately, the article is behind a paywall so were short on the details, but everyone whos played the Imperial March on their steppers has probably got the basic outline in their mind.

- Detecting the audio peak corresponding to a step pulse should be fairly easy.

- Disentangling the motions of two axes would be a bit harder, but presumably can be done based on different room-acoustic filtering of the two motors.

- Direction is the biggest question mark for us, but a stepper probably has a slightly audible glitch when reversing.

## The Trouble with CloudFlare

- We suspect this figure is based on a flawed methodology by which CloudFlare labels all traffic from an IP address that has ever sent spam as "malicious."

- In their blog post, they mentioned obtaining data from Project Honey Pot, in addition to their own systems.

- CloudFlare has not described the nature of the IP reputation systems they use in any detail. 2) External research has found that CloudFlare blocks at least 80% of Tor IP addresses, and this number has been steadily increasing over time. 3) That same study found that it typically took 30 days for an event to happen that caused a Tor IP address to acquire a bad reputation and become blocked, but once it happens, innocent users continued to be punished for it for the duration of the study. 4) That study also showed a disturbing increase over time in how many IP addresses CloudFlare blocked without removal.

- CloudFlare's approach to blocking abusive traffic is incurring a large amount of false positives in the form of impeding normal traffic, thereby damaging the experience of many innocent Tor and non-Tor Internet users, as well as impacting the revenue streams of CloudFlare's own customers by causing frustrated or blocked users to go elsewhere. 5) A report by CloudFlare competitor Akamai found that the percentage of legitimate e-commerce traffic originating from Tor IP addresses is nearly identical to that originating from the Internet at large.

- (Specifically, Akamai found that the "conversion rate" of Tor IP addresses clicking on ads and performing commercial activity was "virtually equal" to that of non-Tor IP addresses). CloudFlare disagrees with our use of the word "block" when describing its treatment of Tor traffic, but that's exactly what their system ultimately does in many cases.

## Facebook Paid $10,000 To A 10-Year-Old For Hacking Instagram

- An anonymous reader writes: Facebook has paid $10,000 to a 10-year-old hacker who discovered how one could hack into Instagram and delete comments made by users.

- Speaking to local publication Iltalehti, Jani said: "I would have been able to eliminate anyone, even Justin Bieber."

- The Finnish hacker just became the youngest person to receive cash from Facebook for hacking its products.

- What's funny is Jani isn't technically old enough to sign-up and use Facebook or Instagram, as it's supposed to be restricted to those under the age of 13.

- Facebook has received more than 2,400 valid submissions and awarded upwards of $4.3 million to over 800 researchers since the bounty program launched in 2011.

## Self-Driving Features Could Lead To More Sex In Moving Cars, Expert Warns

- An anonymous reader writes: According to CBC.ca, "At least one expert is anticipating that, as the so-called 'smart' cars get smarter, there will eventually be an increase in an unusual form of distracted driving: hanky-panky behind the wheel."

- Barrie Kirk of the Canadian Automated Vehicles Centre of Excellence said, "I am predicting that, once computers are doing the driving, there will be a lot more sex in cars.

- That's one of several things people will do which will inhibit their ability to respond quickly when the computer says to the human, 'Take over.'"

- Federal officials, who have been tasked with building a regulatory framework to govern driverless cars, highlighted their concerns in briefing notes compiled for Transport Minister Marc Garneau.

- The Tesla autopilot feature has been receiving the most criticism as there have been many videos posted online showing Tesla drivers engaged in questionable practices, including reading a newspaper or brushing their teeth.

## Aging and bloated OpenSSL is purged of 2 high-severity bugs

- Maintainers of the OpenSSL cryptographic library have patched high-severity holes that could make it possible for attackers to decrypt login credentials or execute malicious code on Web servers. The updates were released Tuesday morning for both versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 of OpenSSL, which a large portion of the Internet relies on to cryptographically protect sensitive Web and e-mail traffic using the transport layer security protocol.

- The fixes bring the latest supported versions to 1.0.1t and 1.0.2h. The decryption vulnerability is the result of what cryptographers call a padding oracle weakness, which allows attackers to repeatedly probe an encrypted payload for clues about the plaintext content inside.

- Still, the conditions might make it possible for an attacker with the ability to monitor the connection to obtain authentication cookies and other small chunks of encrypted text, Valsorda wrote.

- Valsorda said older TLS schemes remain widely used and could make as many as one in four connections vulnerable. The second high-severity bug causes memory corruptions, a weakness that may allow attackers to execute malicious code.

- There appear to be several other requirements that make exploitation difficult. The newly disclosed flaws are at least in part caused by OpenSSL's support of older encryption schemes that are no longer considered state of the art.

## In Search Of A Healthy Gut, One Man Turned To An Extreme DIY Fecal Transplant

-  In Search Of A Healthy Gut, One Man Turned To An Extreme DIY Fecal Transplant  (theverge.com) 

- Josiah Zayner writes: Arielle Duhaime-Ross at The Verge followed Dr. Josiah Zayner, a former Scientist at NASA turned BioHacker, as he attempted the first ever full-body microbiome transplant.

- She writes "Over the course of the next four days, Zayner would attempt to eradicate the trillions of microbes that lived on and inside his body -- organisms that helped him digest food, produce vitamins and enzymes, and protected his body from other, more dangerous bacteria.

- Ruthlessly and methodically, he would try to render himself into a biological blank slate.

- Then, he would inoculate himself with a friend's microbes -- a procedure he refers to as a 'microbiome transplant.

## Serious ImageMagick Zero-Day Vulnerabilities  ImageTragick?

- At least this time its pretty dangerous, a bunch of ImageMagick Zero-Day vulnerabilities have been announced including one that can leave you susceptible to remote code execution.

- Of course if youre already smart and using a third party service to do it like Cloudinary or ImgIX  you are safe. A wildly popular software tool used by websites to process peoples photos can be exploited to execute malicious code on servers and leak server-side files. Security bugs in the software are apparently being exploited in the wild right now to compromise at-risk systems.

- Patches to address the vulnerabilities are available in the latest source code  but are incomplete and have not been officially released, were told. Whenever you upload a profile photo, a gallery of snaps, or a silly meme to a website, theres an extremely high chance that the site is using ImageMagick, an open-source collection of image processing tools, to resize, crop and tweak the pictures. By feeding booby-trapped data  such as a poisoned selfie  to web services using ImageMagick, it may be possible to execute malicious code on the websites server.

- From there hackers can start infiltrating the system to steal secrets, snoop on peoples accounts, and so on.  Source: The Register 

- It seems like the details leaked out before the proper patches could be developed, tested and rolled out  they are expected to come this weekend though. The flaw itself somehow seems to be related to these insecure delegates used by ImageMagick. How to Protect against it 1.
