## The Untold Story of Silk Road, Part 2: The Fall | WIRED

- after staring at IP addresses for hours, Tarbell pasted one of them193.107.86.49into a browser and suddenly there it was: the Silk Road Captcha field

- IP address that was the last known login to the Silk Road VPN. Next to it Tarbell drew a question mark. A subpoena revealed the IPs physical location: Cafe Luna, Sacramento Street, San Francisco.

- roommates were surprised. They thought the quiet guy from Texas whod just rented their extra room for a thousand bucks was named Joshua Terrey

- Homeland Security agents interviewed him

- He did not tell them hed bought the colorful array of fake IDs

- DPR wanted to expand his liberty-fueled brand into an empire, with his own Silk Roadaffiliated bitcoin exchange, credit union, and encrypted communication service

- his fluctuating moods played into the theory that the moniker was actually operated by multiple people

- DPR believed that Nob was a Puerto Rican cartel middleman named Eladio Guzman, but he was in fact DEA agent Carl Force

- Yum put up a sign in the War Room that said: Lab1a.

- n January 27, 2011, days after the Silk Road launch. A user named Altoid talked up this exciting new service that claims to allow you to buy and sell anything online anonymously.

- How do I connect to a Tor hidden service using curl in php? The email listed was rossulbricht@gmail.com

## Waiting for Dark: Inside Two Anarchists' Quest for Untraceable Money | WIRED

- They envision a digital payment network that circumvents every authoritys attempts to tax it, seize it, censor it, track it, or imprison those who would use it to trade in contraband like weapons, drugs, and even abhorrent services like murder-for-hire and child pornography.  And yet for all that, Dark Wallet isnt necessarily illegal.

- Fans donated more than $50,000 for anyone who killed then-Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernankea bte noire of the cryptolibertarian crowdthough there havent been any known attempts to claim its bounties.    A recent article on a blog supporting the Islamic State, the extremist group thats occupied portions of Iraq, praised bitcoin as a potential channel for funding jihadi fighters.

- It is simple, easy, and we ask Allah to hasten its [sic] usage for us.  If Dark Wallet works as promiseda big if, given that the software is still entirely experimental and only scheduled to enter a more public test phase later this summerit may indeed provide those violent revolutionaries a new source of funding.

- Hes named as one of the defendants in a pending lawsuit in California that seeks $460,000.  With a kind of willful optimism, Taaki dismisses that fiasco as a lot of drama. He forged ahead with new projects like a complete reimplementation of bitcoin known as libbitcoin, a full rewriting of the currencys code that many consider cleaner and more modular than Nakamotos original work.

- Following a schedule with little regard for night and day, he and the other coders hack on Dark Wallet for hours, hold impromptu teaching sessions on various crypto schemes, smoke heroic amounts of marijuana, and sleep on mattresses in a frigid, unheated room next door. Now, lit by the devilish glow of a wood-burning stove behind him, Taaki lays out for the visiting anarchists a view of the crypto-anarchic future thats far cheerier than his surroundings.

## Reading Resistors With OpenCV

-  Heres a tip from a wizened engineer Ive heard several times.

- If youre poking around a circuit that has failed, look at the resistor color codes.

- This is where the circuit was overheating, and youre probably very close to discovering the problem. The problem with this technique is that you have to look at and decode all the resistors.

- If automation and computer vision is more your thing, [Parth] made an Android app that will automatically tell you the value of a resistor by pointing a camera at it. The code uses OpenCV to scan a small line of pixels in the middle of the screen.

- Its perfect for scanning through a few hundred through hole resistors, if you dont want to learn the politically correct mnemonic theyre teaching these days. Video below, and the app is available for free on the Google Play store.

## Hacker 3D prints device that can crack a combo lock in 30 seconds

- Its a moderately tricky thing to do, requiring some software, so now hes mechanized the process with the Combo Breaker device. The Combo Breaker uses a stepper motor to rotate the Master Lock combination dial, a servo motor to try and open the mechanism, an Arduino chip to run the software, and 3D printed parts to house the lock and ensure a firm fit with the dial controller. If you merely slip a Master Lock into the device and set it running, the Combo Breaker will take about five minutes to find the combination  which is worrying, but not very useful if youre trying to, for example, break into someones high school or gym locker. But if you use Kamkars earlier method to prime the device by finding the first digit of the combination by hand  something thats relatively easy to do  then the Combo Breaker can do the job in 30 seconds or less.

- Thats quick enough to be a serious problem in the right circumstances (and the wrong hands). Before you start panicking, Kamkar tested the device on a cheaper version of the Master Lock combination dial mechanism.

- The company makes tougher rotary combo locks and the Combo Breaker isnt guaranteed to work on all of them. This isnt not the first time Kamkar has caused a ruckus; hes been a major disruptive force in the tech industry for a while now.

- At 18, he co-founded Fonality, a multimillion dollar communications company, but then got seriously into hacking. When he was 20, Kamkar created the Samy worm and released it onto MySpace, forcing the site to shut down temporarily.

- The worm was one of the fastest-spreading in history, and although it didnt carry a malicious payload, it still earned him a visit from US law enforcement and a felony charge of computer hacking. Since then hes demonstrated critical weaknesses in near-field communications and RFID chips, discovered a major flaw in PHP, and learned how to hijack drones in mid-flight.

## Polygraph.com owner pleads guilty to helping others beat lie detector

- A former cop and owner of the website Polygraph.com has pleaded guilty to five charges of obstruction of justice and mail fraud for teaching people how to cheat lie detector tests. Douglas Williams, 69, of Norman, Oklahoma, faces up to 20 years in jail and up to a $250,000 fine for selling polygraph-evasion training to two clients who were actually part of an undercover sting operation.

- Do you think you have, do you think you have like a lawyer confidentiality with me? But in truth, Williams was undeterred and continued to train the self-styled DHS agent.

- He grew paranoid and told his client to change his cell phone number and to respond to a new email he sent him from the paranoid chicken. Then just hours later he changed his mind about changing the telephone number and focused instead on getting paid through an untraceable money order. Money talks Ten days later, Williams flew to meet the so-called DHS agent, who again admitted he had helped smuggle drugs on four occasions.

- Nonetheless, Williams continued to train him in how to lie  which is a big no-no when you work for the US Department of Justice. Lying, deception and fraud cannot be allowed to influence the hiring of national security and law enforcement officials, particularly when it might affect the security of our borders, said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell of the Justice Departments Criminal Division in a statement announcing Williams guilty plea.

- I can teach you how to pass, nervous or not, no matter what. But the Justice Department holds that he crossed the line when he readily trained people who he believed had criminal records and were hoping to conceal their crimes from government authorities.

## Chinese cyber-spies hid botnet controls in MS TechNet comments

- Cyber-spies are increasingly attempting to hide their command and control operations in plain sight by burying their command infrastructure in the forums of internet heavyweights, including Microsoft. FireEye and Microsoft have successfully shut down the Chinese threat actor APT17s use of the MSFT TechNet blog to hide their hacking operations.

- State-sponsored hackers were posting comments on TechNet in order to embed encoded commands that only their malware could use. APT17, a China-based advanced persistent threat group, posted in forum threads and created profile pages to host encoded C2 IP addresses that would direct a variant of the BLACKCOFFEE backdoor to their C2 server.

- TechNets security was not compromised by this tactic, which could also work on other forums and boards. Most threat actors choose to compromise or hijack easily manipulated websites to host command and control nodes, which is a very noisy tactic that allows for quick detection of their location.

- APT17s tactics of embedding phone home instructions on Microsofts forums are more subtle, but not unprecedented in the wider field of botnet communications.

- APT17 had been observed using popular search engines including Google and Bing to hide their activities and host locations from security researchers. This latest tactic by APT17 of using websites legitimate functionalities to conduct their communications shows just how difficult it is for organisations to detect and prevent advanced threats, said Laura Galante, manager, threat intelligence, FireEye.

## All About Tor

- A little bit ago NCC Group North America had an all-hands retreat, and solicited technical talks.

- I fired off a one-line e-mail: "All About Tor - Everything from the Directory Authorities to the Link Protocol to Pluggable Transports to everything in between."

- I ended up building the deck, with a level of detail I thought was about 80% of what I wanted, and gave a dry-run for my 45 minute talk.

- It ran two full hours. I cut a bunch of content for the talk, but knew I would need to finish the whole thing and make it available.

- The source for the presentation is available in keynote format. Major thanks to all the folks I bugged to build this, especially Nick Mathewson, and those who gave me feedback on mailing lists.

## Heartbleed, eat your heart out: VENOM vuln poisons countless VMs

- An attacker could also potentially access data or execute code on other guest VMs running on the same host system. The bug is considered highly dangerous, because it affects not only systems running QEMU itself, but also other virtualization software that takes advantage of QEMU, including the widely used KVM and Xen open source hypervisors. The affected software will be vulnerable regardless of what operating system it is running on, because QEMU is built from the same code base for all platforms, including Linux, OS X, Windows, and others. QEMU is hardly the only hardware virtualization software in town, however, and other hypervisors that dont use any QEMU code  including Bochs, Microsoft Hyper-V, and VMware  are not affected. How deadly is VENOM?  How VENOM can strike / Source: CrowdStrike (click to enlarge)  The neglected operations part of the VENOM name refers to the all-but-forgotten portion of the QEMU code where the flaw is found.

- Yet VENOM is risky enough to be considered a high-priority vulnerability. In order to mount an exploit attempt, a user on the guest machine would need sufficient permissions to access the floppy disk controller I/O ports.

- Vulnerabilities like VENOM are mostly viewed as an avenue for a highly targeted attack like corporate espionage, cyber warfare or the like. Companies with systems that contain the affected software should definitely contact their vendors and apply the appropriate patches, Eng said.

- Fortunately, several of the more prominent cloud providers were made aware of VENOM before the public disclosure and have been working behind the scenes to ensure that their customers are protected. Rackspace told El Reg that the vulnerability affected a portion of its cloudy servers, but added, We have applied the appropriate patch to our infrastructure and are working with customers to fully remediate this vulnerability. Amazon Web Services, meanwhile, said its customers neednt worry.

- There is no risk to AWS customer data or instances, a spokesman told The Reg. Customer security is our top priority, and AWS takes extraordinary defense in depth measures in constructing systems that do not rely solely upon any single component, such as the hypervisor, to protect customers. Microsofts Azure cloud, on the other hand, uses Redmonds own hypervisor technology, and thus isnt affected by VENOM.

## A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering: Attack of the week: Logjam

- Nicknamed Logjam

- it may admit complete decryption or hijacking of any TLS connection you make to an improperly configured web or mail server

- similar (and more powerful) attacks might already be in the toolkit of some state-level attackers such as the NSA.

- the Diffie-Hellman protocol, as currently deployed in SSL/TLS, may be vulnerable to a serious downgrade attack that restores it to 1990s "export" levels of security

- offers a practical "break" of the TLS protocol against poorly configured servers

- extrapolation of the attack requirements -- combined with evidence from the Snowden documents -- provides some reason to speculate that a similar attack could be leveraged against protocols (including TLS, IPSec/IKE and SSH) using 768- and 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman.

## Downloading Software Safely Is Nearly Impossible

- Youre pretty sure the NSA did not interdict it during shipment, and thus that it comes only with the flaky goatware Microsoft, Lenovo, and any number of Lenovos business partners intended for it to have.

- Now, since you want to get the good and true PuTTY that Simon Tatham wrote, and not some unauthenticated malware, you check for the lock icon and the https:// URL scheme.

- Richard Kettlewell currently owns greenend.org.uk. Look for, and fail to find, the lock icon and the https:// URL scheme.

- Scroll down and note that Tatham offers links to RSA and DSA cryptographic signatures of the binaries, e.g.

- Noting that www.pc-tools.net also does not respond to HTTPS, forego that waste of time. Having downloaded putty.exe, think long and hard before clicking on it.

## Augmented Traffic Control: A tool to simulate network conditions

- We bought two old, secondhand base stations and some mobile phones to start, and spread the word that we were looking for other people to join our effort. At the Infra Hackathon in February 2013, the Augmented Traffic Control team began work on simulating a small-scale 2G network, using base stations and mobile phones. Right away, more engineers signed up to help, and after getting a solid start at the Hackathon, we acquired a good understanding of the cellular software protocols by configuring the software components and analyzing how they communicated with one another.

- Acquiring reasonably priced cellular radios that would reliably run open source base station software was time-consuming. Pivoting to Wi-Fi It was at another infrastructure Hackathon in May 2013 that we decided to shift our focus.

- Once we had something we could share with them, we wanted to get their feedback. Augmented Traffic Control in practice The other teams that used ATC found that it helped save time and pointed out weaknesses in their work.

- They ran automated tests in which the bandwidth connections were changed in order to look at how long Messenger should wait before timing out and how many retries were optimal to send messages.

- We want to give the open source community the same chance to improve on our ideas and innovate with their own  so today we are open-sourcing our design for Augmented Traffic Control on GitHub. Thanks to the following people, who contributed to Augmented Traffic Control across its lifetime: Alessandro Salvatori, Ameesh Goyal, Andrew Pope, Anthony Gargiulo, Chris Vander Mey, Emmanuel Bretelle, Gus Luxton, John Morrow, Patrick Shuff, and Zeal Jagannatha.

## Plod wants your PC? Brick it with a USB stick BEFORE they probe it

- 

- Criminals, activists, and whistle-blowers have a new tool to help foil police by shutting down laptops before they are examined. USBKill is a script that turns an innocent-looking thumb drive into a kill switch that, when unplugged, forces computers to shut down.

- Author Hephaestos (@h3phaestos) says their tool will prevent users becoming the next Ross Ulbricht, the former boss of the Silk Road drug marketplace arrested in a raid in which his laptop was seized while still powered on. USBKill waits for a change on your usb ports, then immediately kills your computer, Hephaestos says in a Github document. The police will use a mouse jiggler to keep the screensaver and sleep mode from activating. If this happens you would like your computer to shut down immediately. Users not content to trust that cops would pull USB sticks from laptops could attach it to their wrists so that it would unplug as they are tackled to the ground.  @manisha72617183 @sehque Just install Fedora.

- Same effect  Jordan H. (@DELICIOUSKEK) April 27, 2015 The self-described developer of software for freedom says USBKill will be updated with additional commands and capabilities, but notes it functions properly in its current state. The tool could be highly effective if run on virtual machines that would vaporise on reboot. Enemies of the state running permanent operating systems however need not bother using the tool if they do not already run full disk encryption. Further they should be prepared to dig themselves a potentially bigger hole if they refuse police requests to hand over passwords.

## Mobile spyware firm mSpy hacked, clients doxxed on dark web

- Mobile spyware firm mSpys database has appeared on the dark web, following an apparent hack on its systems last week. Emails, text messages, payment details, Apple IDs, passwords, photos and location data for mSpyusers have all been exposed, according to investigative reporter Brian Krebs, who broke the story about the apparent  but as yet unconfirmed  breach.

- mSpys technology is sold as a means for parents and employers to surreptitiously snoop on employees or family members, as its corporate blurb (which omits mention of one obvious market  suspicious spouses) explains:  mSpy is the most popular and user-friendly application for watching over your kids, preventing theft and supervising your employees performance.

- Our mobile monitoring software runs invisibly on the target device to track all activity, including call log history, GPS location, calendar updates, text messages, emails, web history and much more.  The firm  which boasts two million users and develops technology for Android, iOS, Windows and Mac PCs  is yet to respond to an El Reg request for comment on the apparent breach. The unknown hackers behind the leak suggest the data dump contains information on more than 400,000 mSpy users to a Tor-based site.

- The use of dark-web hosting is likely to frustrate (or at least delay) any take-down effort. mSpy hardly cuts a sympathetic figure as a victim, but the real victims of the apparent breach are arguably targets of snooping rather than the firm itself. Trey Ford, global security strategist at Metasploit maker Rapid7, commented: People being spied on were having their information stolen by one party, and its now moving rapidly through the underground. Not only is the legality of installing this software questionable (CFAA, etc.

- Corporate executives are effectively information owners, responsible for the data collected, how it is stored and protected, and what to do when something happens, he added.
