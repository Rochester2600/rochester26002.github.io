## Security/Features - Ubuntu Wiki

- Cloud PRNG seed

- Pollinate is a client application that retrieves entropy from one or more Pollen servers and seeds the local Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG)

- Starting with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu cloud images include the Pollinate client, which will try to seed the PRNG with input from https://entropy.ubuntu.com for up to 3 seconds on first boot.

## ircmaxell's blog: Security Issue: Combining Bcrypt With Other Hash Functions

- question on StackOverflow asking if password_verify() was safe against DoS attacks using extremely long passwords

- Bcrypt is limited to 72 character passwords. So on the surface it looks like it shouldn't be vulnerable

- if *ptr is ever 0, then reset it to the start of the string

- That means that "test\0abc" would be treated as "test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0te". In fact, every string that starts with "test\0" will be treated the same.

- this is by-design. And it's not an issue because nobody uses passwords with null bytes.

- Some people think bcrypt isn't enough, and instead choose to "pre-hash" passwords.

- some people want to use a "pepper", so they pre-hash using a HMAC with a private key

- The problem here is the last argument to the two hash functions: true. They force raw output.

- it means that on average 1 out of every 256 passwords (or 0.39%) will have a leading null byte
