## State Machine AttACKs against TLS (SMACK TLS)

- This page presents exploits and disclosure information related to these attacks.

- Message SKIPping Attacks

- the server authentication guarantee relies on the Server Key Exchange message in ephemeral Diffie-Hellman cipher suites (including ECDHE), whereas this message is completely skipped in the RSA key exchange

- We find that several TLS implementations incorrectly allow some messages to be skipped even though they are required for the selected cipher suite.

- JSSE clients allow the peer to skip all messages related to key exchange and authentication.

- FREAK: Factoring RSA Export Keys

- This attack targets a class of deliberately weak export cipher suites. As the name implies, this class of algorithms have been introduced under the pressure of US governments agencies to ensure that the NSA would be able to decrypt all foreign encrypted communication, while stronger algorithms were be banned from export (as they were classified as weapons of war).

- we discovered that several implementations incorrectly allow the message sequence of export ciphersuites to be used even if a non-export ciphersuite was negotiated.

- Thus, if a server is willing to negotiate an export ciphersuite, a man-in-the-middle may trick a browser (which normally doesn't allow it) to use a weak export key

- By design, export RSA moduli must be less than 512 bits long; hence, they can be factored in less than 12 hours for $50 on Amazon EC2.

## Slashdot

- The BlackPhone, a $600-plus encrypted Android handset designed to keep the prying eyes of criminals and the government out of mobile communications, is now fully owned by Silent Circle thanks to the company raking in investment cash

- Silent Circle said Thursday that it has raised $50 million and plans on showing off an encrypted 'enterprise privacy ecosystem' at World Mobile Congress next week. A BlackPhone tablet is on the way, too.

## Popular torrent client can steal your CPU cycles to mine Bitcoins

- If you recently installed or updated uTorrent on your PC, you may have have picked up an unwanted passenger

- a Bitcoin miner called Epic Scale

- that piece of code can be inadvertently installed with the latest uTorrent build (version 3.4.2)

- use your computer as part of a Bitcoin farm (Litecoin, to be exact)

## To Avoid NSA Interception, Cisco Will Ship To Decoy Addresses

## Security/Features - Ubuntu Wiki

- Cloud PRNG seed

- Pollinate is a client application that retrieves entropy from one or more Pollen servers and seeds the local Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG)

- Starting with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu cloud images include the Pollinate client, which will try to seed the PRNG with input from https://entropy.ubuntu.com for up to 3 seconds on first boot.

## ircmaxell's blog: Security Issue: Combining Bcrypt With Other Hash Functions

- question on StackOverflow asking if password_verify() was safe against DoS attacks using extremely long passwords

- Bcrypt is limited to 72 character passwords. So on the surface it looks like it shouldn't be vulnerable

- if *ptr is ever 0, then reset it to the start of the string

- That means that "test\0abc" would be treated as "test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0te". In fact, every string that starts with "test\0" will be treated the same.

- this is by-design. And it's not an issue because nobody uses passwords with null bytes.

- Some people think bcrypt isn't enough, and instead choose to "pre-hash" passwords.

- some people want to use a "pepper", so they pre-hash using a HMAC with a private key

- The problem here is the last argument to the two hash functions: true. They force raw output.

- it means that on average 1 out of every 256 passwords (or 0.39%) will have a leading null byte
