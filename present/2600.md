## Global Threat Intelligence Report: FEBRUARY 2015

- Attackers have cloned malware-laden copies of the most popular apps your employees use

- Think your BYOD program is secure? Perhaps you might want to think again about that as you consider this article.

- It is recommended that all SSL systems be set to disallow backward compatibility of there is a newer version that is more secure.

- Patch Tuesday in February was huge with a total of 56 vulnerabilities being fixed in Microsoft products

- A majority of the patches were for Internet Explorer

- It is recommended that organizations keep awareness at a high level not only for regular employees but also specifically, the executives

- The Anthem breach for all intents and purposes, seems to have been Nation State actors and as such the data that they stole will not, and has not yet been seen to be for sale on the darknet or other places

- Superfish, a simple piece of adware that was installed on every system that Lenovo sold in the last couple of years

- If one cannot trust the supply chain (e.g. laptops from Lenovo without malware pre-loaded) how can one trust that the systems they are buying for their companies are secure?

## State Machine AttACKs against TLS (SMACK TLS)

- This page presents exploits and disclosure information related to these attacks.

- Message SKIPping Attacks

- the server authentication guarantee relies on the Server Key Exchange message in ephemeral Diffie-Hellman cipher suites (including ECDHE), whereas this message is completely skipped in the RSA key exchange

- We find that several TLS implementations incorrectly allow some messages to be skipped even though they are required for the selected cipher suite.

- JSSE clients allow the peer to skip all messages related to key exchange and authentication.

- FREAK: Factoring RSA Export Keys

- This attack targets a class of deliberately weak export cipher suites. As the name implies, this class of algorithms have been introduced under the pressure of US governments agencies to ensure that the NSA would be able to decrypt all foreign encrypted communication, while stronger algorithms were be banned from export (as they were classified as weapons of war).

- we discovered that several implementations incorrectly allow the message sequence of export ciphersuites to be used even if a non-export ciphersuite was negotiated.

- Thus, if a server is willing to negotiate an export ciphersuite, a man-in-the-middle may trick a browser (which normally doesn't allow it) to use a weak export key

- By design, export RSA moduli must be less than 512 bits long; hence, they can be factored in less than 12 hours for $50 on Amazon EC2.

## Twitter Adds "Report Dox" Option

- Twitter announced that its abuse-report system, which was recently refined to simplify and shorten the reporting process, has now expanded to allow users to report content such as self-harm incidents and "the sharing of private and confidential information" (aka doxing)

[http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/02/28/0453203/twitter-adds-report-dox-option](http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/02/28/0453203/twitter-adds-report-dox-option)

## Slashdot

- The BlackPhone, a $600-plus encrypted Android handset designed to keep the prying eyes of criminals and the government out of mobile communications, is now fully owned by Silent Circle thanks to the company raking in investment cash

- Silent Circle said Thursday that it has raised $50 million and plans on showing off an encrypted 'enterprise privacy ecosystem' at World Mobile Congress next week. A BlackPhone tablet is on the way, too.

## Google quietly backs away from encrypting new Lollipop devices by default

- Last year, Google made headlines when it revealed that its next version of Android would require full-disk encryption on all new phones

- But were starting to see new Lollipop phones from Googles partners, and they arent encrypted by default,

- Google apparently decided to relax the requirement, pushing it off to some future version of Android

## Popular torrent client can steal your CPU cycles to mine Bitcoins

- If you recently installed or updated uTorrent on your PC, you may have have picked up an unwanted passenger

- a Bitcoin miner called Epic Scale

- that piece of code can be inadvertently installed with the latest uTorrent build (version 3.4.2)

- use your computer as part of a Bitcoin farm (Litecoin, to be exact)

## Security/Features - Ubuntu Wiki

- Cloud PRNG seed

- Pollinate is a client application that retrieves entropy from one or more Pollen servers and seeds the local Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG)

- Starting with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu cloud images include the Pollinate client, which will try to seed the PRNG with input from https://entropy.ubuntu.com for up to 3 seconds on first boot.

## ircmaxell's blog: Security Issue: Combining Bcrypt With Other Hash Functions

- question on StackOverflow asking if password_verify() was safe against DoS attacks using extremely long passwords

- Bcrypt is limited to 72 character passwords. So on the surface it looks like it shouldn't be vulnerable

- if *ptr is ever 0, then reset it to the start of the string

- That means that "test\0abc" would be treated as "test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0test\0te". In fact, every string that starts with "test\0" will be treated the same.

- this is by-design. And it's not an issue because nobody uses passwords with null bytes.

- Some people think bcrypt isn't enough, and instead choose to "pre-hash" passwords.

- some people want to use a "pepper", so they pre-hash using a HMAC with a private key

- The problem here is the last argument to the two hash functions: true. They force raw output.

- it means that on average 1 out of every 256 passwords (or 0.39%) will have a leading null byte

## Paranoid Android Kaymera smartmobe takes on Blackphone

- MWC2015 Security specialist Kaymera  based in Herzliya, Israel  has launched a mobile security platform aimed at paranoid corporations.

- secure build of Android and accompanying MDM functions

- Using a Samsung Galaxy S5 or Nexus 5, Kaymera reflashes the phone with its own version of Android

- Usage policies can be managed at the corporate, group and device level.

- voice encryption means you can only talk securely to other Kaymera users.

## Jolla Partners To Build Secure Version Of Its Sailfish Mobile OS

- Finnish mobile startup Jolla, which develops the Sailfish mobile OS and its own brand mobile hardware, has just announced it will be partnering to create a security hardened version of the platform, called Sailfish Secure.

- Jolla says it will be working with Finlands SSH Communications

- SSH will be providing comms encryption and key management to Sailfish Secure.

- On the government side, the Russian Federation, ever wary of U.S. spying, recently gave a public show of support to alternative mobile platforms   singling out Sailfish for praise (along with Tizen) for not being made in the U.S. and for being open source.

- the Sailfish UI remains proprietary  so its not fully open sourced at this point.)
