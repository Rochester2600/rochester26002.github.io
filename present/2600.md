## The first five victims of the Stuxnet worm - Hacking News

## (Nothing else) MATor(s): Monitoring the Anonymity of Tor's Path Selection

- In this paper we present MATor: a framework for rigorously assessing the degree of anonymity in the Tor network. The framework explicitly addresses how user anonymity is impacted by real-life characteristics of actually deployed Tor, such as its path selection algorithm, Tor consensus data, and the preferences and the connections of the user.

## How secure is Docker? If you're not running version 1.3.2, NOT VERY

- A nasty vulnerability has been discovered in the Docker application containerization software for Linux that could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges and execute code remotely on affected systems.

- No remediation is available for older versions of Docker and users are advised to upgrade, the company said in a security advisory on Monday.

## Google's Project Loon Can Now Launch Up To 20 Balloons Per Day, Fly 10x Longer

- The Xers also formed a partnership with Raven Aerostar, a company whose balloons have included early NASA near-space probes. Together they confronted problems involving flight duration, control, and power consumption that have baffled balloonists for centuries. Ultimately they came up with a dual-chamber design (one filled with helium, the other with air) and a system of valves that allowed low-energy altitude adjustments. Ballooning is way harder than rocket science, DeVaul says.

## Great Firewall of China Blocks Edgecast CDN, Thousands of Websites Affected

- As far as they are concerned, there is no economic damage, in fact there is an economic incentive since anyone wanting their website to be usable in China would now be best hiring a CDN within China.

- It seems that this whole project was simply going to isolate Chinese netizens further and push China further towards its own separate Internet. This edgecast block will be faced with far less uproar than the ones that came before it, and those caused very little uproar.

## 'Regin': The 'New Stuxnet' spook-grade SOFTWARE WEAPON described

- Regin malware is thought to have been developed by a nation-state because of the financial clout needed to produce code of this complexity. The malware targets organisations in the telecommunications, energy and health sectors.

- including one unconfirmed zero-day in Yahoo! Messenger.

- state.

- Its design makes it highly suited for persistent, long term surveillance operations against targets, the researchers wrote.

## Adobe Reader sandbox popped says Google researcher

- The Acrobat Reader Windows sandbox contains a vulnerability that could allow attackers to break out and gain higher privileges, Google security bod James Forshaw claims.

- While this bug technically isnt fixed, a defence in depth change in 11.0.9 effectively made this difficult if not impossible to exploit,

- While the function resolves the location of the source and destination and ensures they are within the policy there is a timing race once the function calls into the MoveFileEx function in the broker.

## Bitcoin laid bare: Boffins beat anonymity

- few computers and a budget of 1,500 per for servers and traffic charges should be enough to start unmasking users addresses with as much as 60 per cent accuracy.

- If an attacker needed to be stealthy, their success rate would drop to 11 per cent.

- In what they call a generic method to deanonymise a significant fraction of Bitcoin users and correlate their pseudonyms with public IP addresses, the authors say clients can be uniquely identified by their entry nodes, and that these identify the origin of the transaction.

- the boffins reckon they can identify users behind NAT firewalls  and think their attack could be extended to other P2P networks.

- Getting a list of Bitcoin servers using the GETADDR message and working out if the responder is a server using the ADDR response and sending it a VERSION message;
Building a list of nodes as targets for deanonymisation;
Mapping clients to entry nodes; and
Mapping transactions to entry nodes.

- The paper notes that TOR would protect against this,

## Stop selling spyware to despotic regimes, beg MEPs

- It has recently been been revealed that Regin super-spyware was used to successfully hack Belgian telco company Belgacom as far back as 2010. Belgacom counts the European Parliament and the European Commission among its customers

- Should control and sanctions come into play only after the fact or should licences be applied for? Personally I would like to see more licences, she said.

## Debian Forked Over Systemd

- Veteran Unix Admin" collective has announced that the fork of Debian will proceed as a result of the recent systemd controversy.

- The reasons put forward are not just technical; included is a letter of endorsement by Debian Developer Roger Leigh mentioning that "people rely on Debian for their jobs and businesses, their research and their hobbies. It's not a playground for such radical experimentation."

## Economic Failures of HTTPS Encryption

- Interesting paper: Security Collapse of the HTTPS Market.

- the security of the entire ecosystem suffers if any of the hundreds of CAs is compromised (weakest link);

- browsers are unable to revoke trust in major CAs (too big to fail)

- CAs manage to conceal security incidents (information asymmetry);

- ultimately customers and end users bear the liability and damages of security incidents (negative externalities).

## Clarificiation on the IP Address Security in Dropbox Case

- In the judge's ruling, he trivially rejected some arguments that the county had made, determining for example that IP addresses by themselves were not "data processing software" (duh).

- A judge rules that a county has to turn over the IP addresses that were used to access a county mayor's Dropbox account, stating that there is no valid security-related reason why the IP addresses should be exempt from a public records request.

## Tor Weekly News  November 26th, 2014

- a new authority named longclaw was brought online by the autonomous tech collective Riseup

- Tom Ritter drafted a proposal exploring methods a hidden service operator might use to prove to certificate authorities that they control the services private key when requesting SSL certificates.

- Libertas also scanned a large number of currently-running Tor relays to check which ssh access authentication methods their servers supported, finding 2051 relays that still permitted password-based ssh authentication.

## Say hi to the new GetTor

- GetTor is a program that serves Tor Browser over email.

- In highly censored countries (and places) where the Tor Project website is blocked, GetTor would be a convenient way for people to get access to Tor Browser.

- Tor Browser started to get larger in size (over 25 MB), to the point where it wasn't longer possible to send it via most email providers.

- The idea consisted on uploading Tor Browser to the cloud (Dropbox)

- gettor@torproject.org.

## Android Settings Pendingintent Leak

- In Android <5.0 (and maybe >= 4.0), Settings application leaks Pendingintent with a blank base intent (neither the component nor the action is explicitly set) to third party application, bad app can use this to broadcast intent with the same permissions and identity of the Settings application, which runs as SYSTEM uid. Thus bad app can broadcast sensitive intent with the permission of SYSTEM.

- The vulnerability exists in the AddAccountSettings.java in the Settings app

- "By giving a PendingIntent to another application, you are granting it the right to perform the operation you have specified as if the other application was yourself (with the same permissions and identity). As such, you should be careful about how you build the PendingIntent: almost always, for example, the base Intent you supply should have the component name explicitly set to one of your own components, to ensure it is ultimately sent there and nowhere else."

## Android SMS Resend

- In Android <5.0, an unprivileged app can resend all the SMS stored in the user's phone to their corresponding recipients or senders (without user interaction).

- No matter whether these SMS are sent to or received from other people. This may leads to undesired cost to user.

- Even the worse, since Android also allow unprivileged app to create draft SMS, combined with this trick, bad app can send any SMS without privilege requirement.

- Intent intent= new Intent("com.android.mms.transaction.MESSAGE_SENT");
intent.setData(Uri.parse("content://sms"));
intent.setClassName("com.android.mms", "com.android.mms.transaction.SmsReceiver");
sendOrderedBroadcast(intent,null,null,null,SmsManager.RESULT_ERROR_RADIO_OFF,null,null);

## Bitcoin Not That Anonymous Afterall

- One of the big advantages touted by Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) was always the anonymity of the transactions, yes you can track a wallet address and see the transaction history. But theres no real way to link that wallet address to a real person (so we thought).

- It seems like 11% of Bitcoin transactions can be unmasked fairly easily, without any sign that its happening. Unmasking in this context meaning linking the transaction in the blockchain to a public IP address.

- 1,500 per for servers and traffic charges should be enough to start unmasking users addresses with as much as 60 per cent accuracy.

- If an attacker needed to be stealthy, their success rate would drop to 11 per cent.

- Obviously using something like TOR could protect against this,

- In a concrete example, an attacker with a few GB of storage and no more than 50 connections to each Bitcoin server can disclose the senders IP address in 11 per cent of all transactions generated in the Bitcoin network, the paper claims.

## Evil 32: Check Your GPG Fingerprints

- Key servers do not use transport encryption (e.g. SSL) and GPG does not verify keys received when using --recv-keys leaving communicaiton with key servers vulnerable to MITM

- GPG assumes you have manually checked your keys with --fingerprint.

- Stop using 32bit key ids

It takes 4 seconds to generate a colliding 32bit key id on a GPU (using scallion).

- , a key is requested with its 32bit key id. The key server has two keys with the specified key id and GPG imports both keys. It is easy to generate and publish a key that looks identical if you only use 32 bits when specifying a key.

- https://github.com/lachesis/scallion.

- The key server which holds the cloned keys is available at http://pgp.evil32.com.

- If you specify a key id or fingerprint when using --recv-keys GPG should verify that the key/keys returned by the key server actually have the key id or fingerprint you requested.

## CoreOS

- Rocket is a new container runtime, designed for composability, security, and speed

- Docker now is building tools for launching cloud servers, systems for clustering, and a wide range of functions: building images, running images, uploading, downloading, and eventually even overlay networking, all compiled into one monolithic binary running primarily as root on your server

- It is not becoming the simple composable building block we had envisioned.

- Rocket is a command line tool, rkt, for running App Containers.

- App Container Image: definition of a signed/encrypted tgz that includes all the bits to run an app container.

- App Container Runtime: definition of the environment the running app container should be given.

- App Container Discovery: a federated protocol for finding and downloading an app container image.

- simple names like coreos.com/etcd, allowing organizations to federate their downloads without running their own registry.

- Rocket is an alternative to the Docker runtime, designed for server environments with the most rigorous security and production requirements

- the Docker process model - where everything runs through a central daemon - is fundamentally flawed

- We cannot in good faith continue to support Dockers broken security model without addressing these issues.

## PGPy v0.3.0 Released

- Most of the existing options fell into one of two categories:

A direct Popen wrapper around the gpg command-line binary
A wrapper around GPGME, which is a gpg command-line binary wrapping library written in C

- end result is a package that can accomplish a lot in very few lines of code.

- import pgpy

my_privkey = pgpy.PGPKey.from_file("path/to/my/privatekey.asc")

with my_privkey.unlock("sooper_s3kret"), open("path/to/document", 'r') as document:
    doc_sig = my_privkey.sign(document.read())

with open("path/to/document.sig", 'w') as dsf:
    dsf.write(str(doc_sig))

- In just 5 lines of code, we have loaded a private key, unlocked it using a passphrase, signed a document, and then saved the new signature to the disk.

- .The latest version can always be installed from PyPI using pip, and I am also working on getting packages for several Linux distributions into their repositories

- PGPy 0.3.0 is not yet a complete implementation of the OpenPGP specification

## DEATH by COMMENTS: WordPress XSS vuln is BIGGEST for YEARS

- An estimated 86 per cent of WordPress websites harbour a dangerous cross-site scripting (XSS) hole in the popular comment system plugin, in what researcher Jouko Pynnonen calls the most serious flaw in five years.

- WP-Statistics plugin lets attackers inject JavaScript into comments,

- The flaw has existed for about four years, affecting versions between 3.0 to 3.9.2

- Program code injected in comments would be inadvertently executed in the blog administrators web browser when they view the comment

## MasterCard Rails Against Bitcoin's (Semi-)Anonymity

- MasterCard has used a submission (PDF) to an Australian Senate inquiry to argue for financial regulators to move against the pseudonymity of digital currencies such as Bitcoin.

- "Any regulation adopted in Australia should address the anonymity that digital currency provides to each party in a transaction,"

- consumers should be regulated in the same way to achieve a level playing field for all."

## EU flings 1m at open source security audit wheeze

- Next year the European Parliament has allocated up to 1m for a project to audit free software programs in use at the European Commission

- A further 500,000 is being made available to work on encrypting communications among EU institutions.

- it was good to see the institutions investing at least a little in improving the quality and the programs they use.

- The EC runs its IT on more than 350 Linux servers. All new web applications are protected by an open source-based solution for authentication, currently serving more than 300 existing web applications, more than 60,000 users and performing more than 10,000,000 authentications on a yearly basis with more than 17,000 different users every day

## EFI - Trammell Hudson's Projects

- In this presentation we demonstrate the installation of persistent firmware modifications into the EFI boot ROM of Apple's popular MacBooks

- The bootkit can be easily installed by an evil-maid via the externally accessible Thunderbolt ports and can survive reinstallation of OSX as well as hard drive replacements

- Once installed, it can prevent software attempts to remove it and could spread virally across air-gaps by infecting additional Thunderbolt devices.

- It is possible to use a Thunderbolt Option ROM to circumvent the cryptographic signature checks in Apple's EFI firmware update routines

- There are neither hardware nor software cryptographic checks at boot time of firmware validity

## FAUXTRIBUTION?

- A group calling itself the Guardians of Peace claimed

- the intrusion into SPEs network consisted of the deployment of destructive malware and the theft of proprietary information as well as employees personally identifiable information and confidential communications

- attacks also rendered thousands of SPEs computers inoperable

- the FBI now has enough information to conclude that the North Korean government is responsible for these actions

- malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed

- significant overlap between the infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea

- the tools used in the SPE attack have similarities to a cyber attack in March of last year against South Korean banks and media outlets, which was carried out by North Korea

## Mathematicians Make a Major Discovery About Prime Numbers | WIRED

- mathematicians have made the first substantial progress in 76 years

- How far apart can consecutive primes be

- The average spacing between primes approaches infinity as you travel up the number line, but in any finite list of numbers, the biggest prime gap could be much larger than the average

- No one has been able to establish how large these gaps can be

- In 1985, Tao, then a 10-year-old prodigy, met Erdos at a math event

- So thats kind of cool.

## Yik Yak MITM Hack (Give the Dog a Bone)

- Yik Yak, heres the run down. Its kind of like Twitter, but your messages are only shared with people who are currently within a few miles of you. Also, your account is supposed to be totally anonymous

- Yik Yak authenticates users based solely on a user ID. There are no passwords

- Yik Yak happens to make a call to an analytics tool called Flurry every time the app is fired. Flurry needs a way to track the users for Yik Yak, so of course the Yik Yak App tells Flurry the users ID

- Flurry disables HTTPS by default,

- The Android app is programmed to ignore bad SSL certificates.

## Git thee behind me, Git crit security bug!

- GitHub has acknowledged theres a flaw in its client software and recommended that users upgrade as soon as possible.

- An attacker can craft a malicious Git tree that will cause Git to overwrite its own .git/config file when cloning or checking out a repository, leading to arbitrary command execution in the client machine

- Linux clients are not affected if they run in a case-sensitive filesystem

- Git clients running on OS X (HFS+) or any version of Microsoft Windows (NTFS, FAT) are exploitable through this vulnerability

- repositories hosted on github.com cannot contain any of the malicious trees that trigger the vulnerability

## Linux 'GRINCH' vuln is AWFUL. Except, er, maybe it isn't

- A dispute has arisen about the seriousness of a vulnerability in Linux, dubbed Grinch, that supposedly creates a privilege escalation risk

- the Linux authorisation system, which can unintentionally allow privilege escalation, granting a user root

- The scope of this vulnerability is very limited. Grinch is not remotely exploitable; it requires that an attacker have physical access the server they want to attack.

- In addition, the attacker must already have access to an account in the wheel group (i.e., already have elevated privileges as local administrators), polkit [toolkit for privilege authorisation] must be installed, and the PackageKit package management system must be in use.

- The barriers to exploitation are significant; in a very real way to exploit this flaw you must already have very high levels of access, making exploiting this vulnerability unnecessary.

- Red Hat dismisses the flaw entirely as expected behavior.

- An independent researcher first posted about the vulnerability  which he called PackageKit Privilege Escalation  almost a month ago before Alert Logic picked up on the threat and publicised it.

- The bug was named after the famous Dr Seuss character, since it supposedly carries the potential to ruin the season of network administrators

## Researchers Discover SS7 Flaw, Allowing Total Access To Any Cell Phone, Anywhere

- Researchers discovered security flaws in SS7 that allow listening to private phone calls and intercepting text messages on a potentially massive scale

- even when cellular networks are using the most advanced encryption now available

- to be reported at a hacker conference in Hamburg this month

- functions built into SS7 for other purposes  such as keeping calls connected as users speed down highways, switching from cell tower to cell tower  that hackers can repurpose for surveillance because of the lax security on the network

- It is thought that these flaws were used for bugging German Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone

- can locate callers anywhere in the world, listen to calls as they happen or record hundreds of encrypted calls and texts at a time for later decryption

- There is also potential to defraud users and cellular carriers by using SS7 functions

## Top Security Features Added to Android Lollipop

- Kill switch

- To aid corporate and personal users dealing with stolen devices, the personal data stored within the device can now be remotely wiped and the phone made inoperable

- Encryption on the fly

- Lollipop is default encryption

- Improved malware protection and sandboxing

- SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux), which aims to provide enhanced protection against malware and vulnerabilities. This feature ensures secure app isolation, which helps to keep private data secure should the device be compromised.

- Smart Device Lock

- Smart Lock adds the ability to set trusted locations such as home or the office, where your device will open automatically once you enter that region. You can do the same in conjunction with specific Bluetooth and NFC enabled Android Wear smart watches.

- Multiple User Profiles

- Users can create a different guest profile which has limited access

## pyllyukko/user.js

- This is a user.js configuration file for Mozilla Firefox thats supposed to harden Firefoxs settings and make it more secure.

- Limit the possibilities to track the user through web analytics

- Harden the browser, so it doesnt spill its guts when asked (have you seen what BeEF can do?)

- Limit the browser from storing anything even remotely sensitive persistently (mostly just making sure private browsing is always on)

- Make sure the browser doesnt reveal too much information to shoulder surfers

- Harden the browsers encryption (cipher suites, protocols, trusted CAs)

- Still be at least somewhat usable in daily use

- Just drop the user.js file to your Firefox profile directory at ~/.mozilla/firefox/XXXXXXXX.your_profile_name and verify that the settings are effective from about:config.

## Feds used Adobe Flash to identify Tor users visiting child porn sites

- 16 months ago, word emerged that the FBI exploited a recently patched Firefox vulnerability to unmask Tor users visiting a notorious child pornography site

- It turns out that the feds had waged an even broader uncloaking campaign a year earlier by using a long-abandoned part of the open source Metasploit exploit framework to identify Tor-using suspects

- Omaha defense attorney Joseph Gross challenged the accuracy of evidence it uncovered against a Rochester, New York-based IT worker who claims he was falsely implicated in the campaign

- they even provided a link to the code on Archive.org

## Sony Leaks Reveal Hollywood Is Trying To Break DNS

- leaked documents reveal a frightening line of attack that's currently being considered by the MPAA: What if you simply erased any record that the site was there in the first place?

- the MPAA's lawyers would target the Domain Name System that directs traffic across the internet

- The tactic was first proposed as part of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in 2011

- If a takedown notice could blacklist a site from every available DNS provider, the URL would be effectively erased from the internet. No one's ever tried to issue a takedown notice like that

## Meet FlashFlood, the lightweight script that causes websites to falter

- Dubbed FlashFlood, the looped JavaScript bombards a website with requests in a way that bypasses server defenses designed to protect against crashes

- ttackers could lure unwitting participants into taking part in denial-of-service attacks, through cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or by tricking large numbers of people into visiting an innocuous-looking link

- FlashFlood is particularly potent against heavy database-driven sites if they rely on caching to protect themselves. Many sites running on Drupal are a good example

## Xiao's Blog: LastPass' attempt at client-side Android encryption with JavaScript: a breakdown

- Overview of how LastPass gets the credentials into a webpage

- User browses to website 'W' in Chrome

- LastPass' Accessibility service get's notified that W is being browsed to. If there are credentials for this site, it displays the usernames to the user (left screenshot below)

- The user picks one

- LastPass' Accessibility service discreetly copies a JavaScript program 'P' to the clipboard then pastes it into the address bar, handily obscured by the instructions to the user (right screenshot below)

- The user follows the prompt and presses 'enter', executing P

- P finds the username/password fields, and fills them out with the credentials

- So how does LastPass put the credentials into P?

- On versions at least as old as 3.2.3 (the latest APK on the LastPass release history page) it simply pasted them in, encoded in Base64:

- So what does the new P do?

- t encrypts the credentials based on the unix time of the request and the website being visited.

- So there you have it. Don't use the LastPass Android app to fill into Chrome; it ain't safe.

## Snowden files show NSA's AURORAGOLD pwned 70% of world's mobile networks

- The mobile tapping system, dubbed AURORAGOLD, successfully cracked 701 of an estimated 985 cellular networks worldwide, according to the leaked NSA presentation released by The Intercept.

- was done by snooping on the private communications of key workers within the industry to capture technical documentation and encryption keys that allowed the agency access to mobile calls

- It was assumed intelligence agencies can break the widely used A5/1 algorithm; now we know GCHQ and the NSA have been working on cracking the supposedly stronger A5/3 used in 3G. For that, the Brits needed a 4m system to attack the cipher by 2012.
