## Spy agency whistle-blower posted top secret report to 4chan but users dismiss it as 'fake and gay'

- A whistle-blower anonymously published a highly sensitive report obtained from an Australian spy agency on the website 4chan,

- his document was soon automatically deleted after it failed to gain much attention.

- dismissed it as "fake and gay".

- The Defence Intelligence Organisation assessment contained information that could have been exploited by foreign intelligence services and risked causing serious harm to Australia's national security interests, according to the Australian Department of Defence.

## Is Extended Random A Malicious NSA Plot?  Quarrelsome

- Did Clyde Frog subvert crypto standards with a backdoored random number generator called Dual_EC

- Long after cryptographers published an analysis showing that Dual_EC could have been a backdoor, circumstantial evidence continues to pile up suggesting thats exactly what it was.

- Clyde Frog proposed a special kind of CSPRNG, a PKRNG, that generates output using a public key for which they hold the private key

- Using that private key, they can observe CSPRNG output on the wire, decrypt it, and use that to rewind and fast-forward other peoples CSPRNGs, discovering their keys.

- Clyde Frog pays IETF people to introduce a TLS extension, Extended Random. Extended Random alters TLS so that it discloses a variable amount of CSPRNG output, but always more than 28 bytes. Problem solved! Clyde Frog has standardized a backdoor (Dual_EC) and a TLS backdoor accelerator (Extended Random).

## The Intel 6th Gen Skylake Review: Core i7-6700K and i5-6600K Tested

- The Total War franchise moves on to Attila, another The Creative Assembly development, and is a stand-alone strategy title set in 395AD where the main story line lets the gamer take control of the leader of the Huns in order to conquer parts of the world.

- Whether the user is flying high in the mountains with long draw distances or dealing with assorted trash in the city, when cranked up to maximum it creates stunning visuals but hard work for both the CPU and the GPU.  For our test we have scripted a version of the in-game benchmark, relying only on the final part which combines a flight scene along with an in-city drive-by followed by a tanker explosion.

## Stop Windows 10 spying dead in its tracks with one free app

- Microsofts new operating system has been a hit with the tech press and users alike, with millions of people around the world singing the new software praise.

- We also shared an except from Microsofts Windows 10 privacy statementthat is more than a little disconcerting. Heres that excerpt again: Finally, we will access, disclose and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails, other private communications or files in private folders), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to: 1.comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies; 2.protect our customers, for example to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of the services, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone; 3.operate and maintain the security of our services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks; or 4.protect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services  however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customers private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.  Whether or not you might be considered a privacy nut, this should alarm you at least a little.

- Thats just the tip of the iceberg, though  there are a number of other things users concerned with privacy will want to address. Enter DoNotSpy10, a new free app from German developer pXc-coding.

- Namely, youll still need to go online to Microsofts site and opt out of the companysinvasive advertising tracking features.

- For complete instructions on how to do that, be sure to visit our earlier article. To download and install DoNotSpy10 for free, follow the link below in our source section. UPDATE: It should be noted that DoNotSpy10 is ad-supported, and it includes OpenCandy software that displays ads in other programs.

## Dropbox adds USB two factor authentication for paranoid Chrome users

- 

- Dropbox has added dongle-driven two factor authentication to its cloud sharing services for more highly risk-averse users in a bid to foil phishing attempts. The USB authentication dongle will replace the need to manually enter a six digit code sent over insecure SMS or generated by authenticator apps.

- Punters will need a U2F-certified USB key designed by Google and Yubico especially for two factor authentication. Security keys provide stronger defense against credential theft attacks like phishing, Dropbox security bods Patrick Heim and Jay Patel say. Even if youre using two-step verification with your phone, some sophisticated attackers can still use fake Dropbox websites to lure you into entering your password and verification code. They can then use this information to access your account. The aim is to foil the chance that especially clever phishers could lure Dropbox users to enter both their username and passwords, and two factor keys by nixing the need to type in the digits. U2F flow.  Users U2F USBs can be activated by plugging in the device and following a setup wizard within Dropboxs security add a key options. The key only works for Google Chrome users at present.

- Firefox fans and Internet Explorer holdouts can still login using their existing two factor options.

## CAUGHT: Lenovo crams unremovable crapware into Windows laptops  by hiding it in the BIOS

- Automatically, and rather rudely, they connect to the internet to download and install drivers, a system optimizer, and whatever else Lenovo wants on your computer.

- The PC makers laptops definitely do, however. Owners of LSE-afflicted computers urged to update their firmware A tool quietly released on July 31 will uninstall the engine if it is present in your machine: it is available here for notebooks, and available here for desktops. On Tuesday this week, Lenovo published a full list of affected desktop and notebook models.

- Lenovo, Microsoft and an independent researcher have discovered possible ways this program could be exploited by an attacker, including a buffer overflow attack and an attempted connection to a Lenovo test server. The PC biz continued:  LSE uses the Microsoft Windows Platform Binary Table (WPBT) capability.

- And it sounds as though Microsoft pressured Lenovo to kill it. Richard Stallman is sounding less and less crazy with discoveries like this, noted another Hacker News poster, referring to the Free Software Foundation supremo who has warned for decades that were losing control of our computers. To think a manufacturer would essentially rootkit their own machines is testament to how bad things have become. This comes on the back of Lenovos Superfish scandal, in which the PC maker shipped laptops with adware on them that opened up people to man-in-the-middle eavesdropping.

- Miscreants could exploit the bundled crapware to snoop on victims encrypted connections to websites. Weve asked Microsoft to explain the thinking behind its WPBT feature.

## New Docker crypto locker is a blocker for Docker image mockers

- When you later pull this image, Docker Engine uses the publishers public key to verify that the image you are about to run is exactly what the publisher created, has not been tampered with and is up to date. Docker is basing its code-signing capabilities on Notary, a standalone piece of software that it first unveiled at the DockerCon 2015 conference in June.

- Notary, in turn, is based on The Update Framework (TUF), a project that offers both a specification and a code library for generic software update systems. At DockerCon, Docker CTO Solomon Hykes explained that he likes the TUF design because it not only offers protection against content forgery and various forms of man-in-the-middle attacks, but it also offers what the TUF project calls survivable key compromise. Basically it means if one of the keys in the system gets lost or stolen, youre in trouble, but youre not completely, impossibly screwed, Hykes said.

- Plugins to support various types of storage volumes, which were experimental in the previous version, are considered stable in Engine 1.8.

- Docker Registry, meanwhile, has been upped to version 2.1 and is faster and supports new cloud storage drivers for Aliyun OSS, Ceph Rados, and OpenStack Swift.

- The Compose, Machine, and Swarm orchestration tools have also been improved. Full release notes for Docker 1.8, including download links, are available on the projects public GitHub repo, here.

## Cosa Nostra Dead Drops

- Investigators described how Messina Denaro, 53, disdains telecommunications and relies on handwritten notes, or pizzini, to relay orders.

- The notes were wadded tight, covered in tape and hidden under rocks or dug into soil until go-betweens retrieved them.

## DNS root zone drama: Follow live the most important dullest ceremony you'll ever see

- The key signing is needed to ensure miscreants cant tamper with the root zone without detection. Twenty-five people will be locked into a high-security box for the whole day in order to create a pair of new public and private keys for the internets DNS root.

- The keys will then be used by the rest of the top level of the internet to ensure safe and secure interactions between them, i.e., to make sure no one is able to hack the internet. As we write this, the ceremony is already an hour in and will run until 5pm local time followed by 15 minutes catch-up, after which about half the attendees will fly back to virtually every corner of the globe. Its also the fifth anniversary of the first KSK ceremony, which took place on 16 June 2010 and was used to introduce the DNSSEC security protocol at the root server level. As part of the ceremony, some of the hardware that generates the keys will be replaced  something that ICANN says is out of an abundance of caution but really its because the organization was embarrassed into doing so by the dot-com operator Verisign in a damning paper into the organizations technical abilities. Smooth sailing Although the ceremonies are painfully long, pedantic, and scripted down to the tiniest detail, things have often gone awry on the day itself. For some reason, The Guardian suddenly became very excited about the ceremony in 2014 and sent along a reporter with a camera.

- The worst was when an accidental door slam tripped a seismic sensor and locked everyone in a cage, forcing them to trigger an evacuation in order to get out and start again. Far from the ceremonies becoming mundane, however, they are of increasing importance.

- Originally DNSSEC was used by only a few top-level domains, but now it is a contractual requirement for the 1,000+ new internet extensions that ICANN has introduced and will continue to introduce for the next six months. The extra level of security being added to the DNS is also being increasingly used as a platform for more protocols and applications, such as DANE and a proposal to create the next generation of secure email. If the master key generated by the ceremony was somehow stolen or misplaced, it would currently create a few technical headaches and internet engineers would lose their evening and possibly their weekend fixing it.

- And why its also vital that ICANN fix the technical issues that were highlighted by Verisign six months ago.

## Parrot drones easily taken down or hijacked, researchers demonstrate

-  Michael Robinson				 In two separate presentations at Def Con in Las Vegas last weekend, security experts demonstrated vulnerabilities in two consumer drones from Parrot.

- The simplest of the attacks could make Parrot drones, including the companys Bebop model, fall from the sky with a keystroke. In a live demonstration at Def Cons Internet of Things Village on August 8, Ryan Satterfield of the security consulting firmPlanet Zudademonstrated a takedown of a Parrot A.R.Drone by exploiting the drones built-in Wi-Fi and an open telnet port on the drones implementation of the BusyBox real-time operating system.

- Killing flight processes didnt just make the Bebop drop to the ground, howeverin an indoor test, Robinson said the drone suddenly lurched off like a projectile as it ungracefully shut down, slamming into a kitchen appliance. Robinson also found that the Bebop also uses an open FTP server to transfer pictures and video back to the user.

- Ars attempted to reach Parrot for comment, but we have not yet received a response; well update this story if more information becomes available. Robinson also tested the security of the more expensive DJI Phantom III drone, with somewhat different results.

- GPS interference caused problems for the return-home function and also, strangely, made video return from the Phantom unstable.

## Choc Factory patches zero day Google for Work hack hole

- 

- Google has patched a vulnerability in the Google Admin application that could allow attackers to steal enterprise accounts. MWR Labs researcher Rob Miller reported the sandbox-hopping hole, rated medium severity, which can be exploited by malware residing on a users device.

- The flaw can be used to steal Google for Work credentials, according to the UK researcher. A malicious application on the same device as the Google Admin application is able to read data out of any file within the Google Admin sandbox, bypassing the Android Sandbox, Miller says in an advisory. Devices with Google Admin installed should not install any untrusted third party applications. Miller says the problem occurs when the Google Admin app receives a URL from another installed application and loads it in a webview within its own activity. Attackers using a file:// URL to link to a file that they controlled could use symbolic links to bypass the Same Origin Policy and hop the sandbox. That attack is possible using any app on an Android device. The hole was disclosed in March and extended after the Chocolate Factory acknowledged it passed its own hard 90-day patch-or-die deadline. MWR Labs published after that deadline was then exceeded. Google released an update on August 14 a day after the public disclosure labelling the holes under bug fixes.

## Kaspersky: Freemasons coded fake malware in the Bermuda Triangle

- And the accusations are complete nonsense, pure and simple, Kaspersky wrote in a post that opens by saying its possible to determine who killed JFK, learn who controls the the Bermuda Triangle and divine the true purposes of the Freemasons if one cites anonymous sources.

- Kaspersky then goes on to offer his version of events, that opens In 2012-2013, the anti-malware industry suffered badly because of serious problems with false positives. Kaspersky Labs, and others, found someone  spreading legitimate software laced with malicious code targeting specifically the antivirus engines of many companies. The problem was first noticed in November 2012 when  our products produced false positives on several files that were in fact legitimate.

- An internal investigation showed that these incidents occurred as the result of a coordinated attack by an unknown third party. New and slightly-tweaked versions of those applications had been an irritant to the AV community for months, Kaspersky wrote, so in 2013 the industry staged a a closed-door meeting among leading cybersecurity and other software industry players that also suffered from the attack  as well as vendors that were not affected by the problem but were aware of it. During that meeting the participants exchanged information about the incidents, tried to figure out the reasons behind them, and worked on an action plan.

- Kaspersky says thats a ridiculous idea and that As far back as the late nineties Id take with me to press conferences a placard with the word No! on it.

- Id just point to it when every third question was: Do you write viruses yourselves, for your product to then cure the infections? Do they really think an 18+ year-old business built 100% on trust would be doing such things? he asks in the post? Clearly, Reuters does think just that.

## Mozilla testing very private browsing mode

- 

- The Mozilla Foundation has outlined plans for enhanced private browsing in its Firefox browser. The outfit thinks that when you open a Private Browsing window in Firefox youre sending a signal that you want more control over your privacy than current private browsing experiences actually provide.

- Enough that Firefox may one day actively block website elements that could be used to record user behavior across sites such as content, analytics, social and other services that might be collecting data without your knowledge. Mozillas testing out its approach to blocking such services in a new Private Browsing feature in pre-beta Firefox builds.

- The organisation warns that In some cases, websites might appear broken when elements that track behavior are blocked. Plenty of advertising outfits rely on tracking and analytics services, so are not thrilled with Mozillas plans as its already no picnic turning a quid online. Mozillas also trialling better verification of plug-ins, again in order to stop unwanted ads appearing but also to improving Firefoxs security.

## Parrot drone pwned (and possibly killed) with Wi-Fi log-in

- Lack of security in the Wi-Fi link to the Parrot AR drone allows it to be blown out of the sky by telnetting in and killing the process. Ryan Satterfield, who describes himself as an ethical hacker and runs consultancy Planetzuda.com, explains on his YouTube channel that the Parrot drone hack was demonstrated at DEF CON 23.  YouTube Video  The AR drone is controlled by Wi-Fi from a smartphone app but while a Bluetooth link would be paired and only the users phone would work with it, the Wi-Fi isnt hidden and there is no password. There is no obfuscation or protection through the app.

- The default Telnet port 23 is left open so anyone within Wi-Fi distance of the AR Drone can log in to its Busybox implantation of Linux.

- You automatically get root access. Just typing Kill 1 terminates the flying and the drone drops from the sky. A more sophisticated vuln was also demonstrated at DEF CON.

- Boffin Michael Robinson, from Stevenson University in Maryland and George Mason University in Northern Virginia showed how with the free Parrot app it was possible the pwn the Parrot in-flight. Using a Wi-Fi de-auth attack, they disconnected the legitimate user and took control with their own implementation of the app.

- This would allow them to steal the drone. The Register has contacted Parrot for comment but no-one was immediately available.

## No-Fly List Uses Predictive Assessments

- The US government has admitted that it uses predictive assessments to put people on the no-fly list:

- In a little-noticed filing before an Oregon federal judge, the US Justice Department and the FBI conceded that stopping US and other citizens from travelling on airplanes is a matter of predictive assessments about potential threats, the government asserted in May.

- By its very nature, identifying individuals who may be a threat to civil aviation or national security is a predictive judgment intended to prevent future acts of terrorism in an uncertain context, Justice Department officials Benjamin C Mizer and Anthony J Coppolino told the court on 28 May.

- Judgments concerning such potential threats to aviation and national security call upon the unique prerogatives of the Executive in assessing such threats.

## Collective noun search for security vulns moves into beta testing

- The recent rash of Android vulnerabilities has made it clear that a new collective noun for such flaws, and possibly a separate one for security bugs in general, is required. In its early days the infosec industry borrowed heavily from the lexicon of biology to talk about problems affecting systems: viruses, worms, bugs etc.

- This would suggest something like plague, scourge or intrusion (as in an intrusion of cockroaches) as potential candidates. But since then, computer security types have ditched lab coats for combat fatigues and adopted terms that began in the military  such as APT (advanced persistent threat)  so perhaps we ought to widen the field. A cyber of flaws is one of several new terms currently being rigorously tested at Vulture Central, based on early suggestions on Twitter.

- Windows (hat tip Jack Daniel), overflow and panic have all been suggested as potential candidates. Nest, basket and the slightly more surreal hatstand have also been mentioned.

- The Ghost vuln even had its own unofficial song, the Ghostbusters theme. Security bugs even have their own awards, thanks to categories in the Pwnie Awards that take place during the Black Hat conference in Vegas every year. Any way you care to look at it, were well past knowing them by CVE number, but we still dont have a collective noun.

- Enough! Its come to the point where we need to turn it over to Reg readers to decide from among the candidates, hence this poll.

## Hacker slaps Dolphin, Mercury browsers, squirts zero day

- For comparison FireFox scores up to 500 million installs and Chrome clocks some five billion installs, or roughly the population of Earth in 1987. The self-described Java nerd (@rotlogix) reported the vulnerabilities to the developers, both of which responded with patches. He says Dolphin can be slapped by manipulating its themes with the following attack: An attacker with the ability to control the network traffic for users of the Dolphin Browser for Android can modify the functionality of downloading and applying new themes for the browser.

- Through the exploitation of this functionality, an attacker can achieve an arbitrary file write, which can then be turned into code execution within the context of the browser on the users device.

- The only user interaction this requires is selecting, downloading, and applying a new Dolphin Browser theme. The Dolphin Browser was last updated in July meaning that all users are vulnerable to the zero day vulnerability.

- The hacker recommends users stick with their current theme and consider using a different browser until a fix is dropped. But they should avoid moving to Mercury; in fact those users should dump that browser too thanks to a series of chained unpatched holes, according to the hacker. The Mercury Browser for Android suffers from an insecure Intent URI scheme implementation and a path traversal vulnerability within a custom web server used to support its WiFi Transfer feature.

- Chaining these vulnerabilities together can allow a remote attacker to perform arbitrary reading and writing of files within the Mercury Browsers data directory. Interested application security bods can peruse his posts for full technical details.

## Hardened Linux stalwarts Grsecurity pull the pin after legal fight

- The gurus behind the popular and respected Linux kernel hardening effort Grsecurity will stop providing free support for their stable offering.

- So its no surprise that they didnt bother to hire us to perform the port properly for them or to actively maintain the security of the kernel theyre providing to their paid customers. But Spengler cant tolerate the fact the aforementioned company has been using the grsecurity name all over its marketing material and blog posts to describe their backported, unsupported, unmaintained version in a version of Linux with other code modifications that havent been evaluated by us for security impact. Simply put, it is NOT grsecurity  it doesnt meet our standards and at the same time it uses our brand and reputation to further its marketing, he added.

- They are publishing a grsecurity for a kernel version we never released a patch for. We decided that it is unfair to our sponsors that the above mentioned unlawful players can get away with their activity [and] we will cease the public dissemination of the stable series and will make it available to sponsors only, Spengler continued in his statement. The test series, unfit in our view for production use, will however continue to be available to the public to avoid impact to the Gentoo Hardened and Arch Linux communities. If this does not resolve the issue, despite strong indications that it will have a large impact, we may need to resort to a policy similar to Red Hats or eventually stop the stable series entirely as it will be an unsustainable development model. Grsecurity provides various operating-system-level security defenses against hacking attacks  from stack overflow protection and bounds checks on kernel-copied data to filesystem hardening.

- It includes a lot of set-it-and-forget-it features that automatically prevent systems from coming to harm, and is used by most who rely on a hardened flavor of Linux. Neal Wise, director of penetration testing firm Assurance.com.au and a Unix geek, says the decision is a tragic one that could most affect hosting providers who distribute Linux images containing grsecuritys popular deep security access controls. There has been a very a long history of companies not paying for the cost of the open source engineering they rely on, Wise says.

- I find it really rich that someone would string them along with a legal fight when those engineers use their open source technology. It will be difficult to replace grsecuritys top-notch patching efforts.

## BitTorrent patched against flaw that allowed crippling DoS attacks

-  BitTorrent, Inc.				 The maintainers of the open BitTorrent protocol for file sharing have fixed a vulnerability that allowed lone attackers with only modest resources to take down large sites using a new form of denial-of-service attack. Further ReadingHow BitTorrent could let lone DDoS attackers bring down big sitesuTorrent, Mainline, and Vuze most susceptible to DoS abuse, researchers say.The technique was disclosed two weeks ago in a research paper submitted to the 9th Usenix Workshop on Offensive Technologies.

- Again referring to the diagram above [which appears immediately below in this Ars post], this means that (3) is dropped and (4), (5) and (6) never make it to the victim.

- Since the mitigation occurs at the libuTP level, other company protocols that can run over libuTP like Message Stream Encryption (MSE) are also serviced by the mitigation. BitTorrent, Inc. Referring to the same diagram, heres a more detailed description of the attack and the way the change announced Thursday is intended to lower the bandwidth amplification factor (BAF) it provides: After the reflector has received the first packet from an attacker it transitions over to a connected state at (1).

- To properly build the packet the attacker will need to provide the reflector with acknowledgement number of the last received packet at (2). The flaw in libTP would allow the reflector to accept any acknowledgement number at (3) allowing the attack to be carried out.

- A mitigation relies on the fact that it would be fairly difficult for an attacker to guess the acknowledgement number at (2) for a sufficiently large number of reflectors. The intention of the change is to reduce the BAF to as low a value as possible making attacks like this very high-effort.

## Fake EFF site serving espionage malware was likely active for 3+ weeks

-  Employees of MGM  A spear-phishing campaign some researchers say is linked to the Russian government masqueraded as the Electronic Frontier Foundation in an attempt to infect targets with malware that collects passwords and other sensitive data. The targeted e-mails, which link to the fraudulent domain electronicfrontierfoundation.org, appear to be part of a larger campaign known as Pawn Storm.

- Last October, researchers at security firm Trend Micro brought the campaign to light and said it was targetingUS military, embassy, and defense contractor personnel, dissidents of the Russian government, and international media organizations.

- Last month, Trend Micro said the espionage malware campaign entered a new phase by exploiting what then was a zero-day vulnerability in Oracles widely used Java browser plugin.

- The attacker, now able to run any code on the users machine due to the Java exploit, downloads a second payload, which is a binary program to be executed on the targets computer. Quintin said he suspects electronicfrontierfoundation.org has been serving malware since August 4, when the domain address was registered.

- On Friday morning, it was redirecting users to the authentic EFF page. The attack is a potent reminder of the importance of installing security updates promptly.

## Zone Transfers on The Alexa Top 1 Million Part 2 | ethicalhack3r

-  In part 1 of this blog post I conducted a DNS Zone Transfer (axfr) against the top 2000 sites of the Alexa Top 1 Million.

- I did this to create a better subdomain brute forcing word list.

- At the time, conducting the Zone Transfer against the top 2000 sites took about 12 hours, this was using a single threaded bash script.

- I was pretty proud of this achievement at the time and thought that doing the same for the whole top 1 million sites was beyond the time and resources that I had. After creating a multithreaded and parallelised PoC in Ruby to do the Zone Transfers, it took about 5 minutes to conduct the Zone Transfers against the top 2000 compared to the 12 hours it took me to do the top 2000 using a single thread.

- I decided it was possible to do a Zone Transfer against the whole top 1 million sites. There were 60,472 successful Zone Transfers (%6) out of the Alexa Top 1 Million, this equates to 566MB of raw data on disk.

## How to Quash Firefox's Silent Requests

- Disable CSS and JavaScript and fire up iftop or Windows Resource Monitor, hover over some links and watch the fun begin.

- Strangely enough the latter bug is still labeled WONTFIX even though the solution is in the comments (setting network.http.speculative-parallel-limit to 0).  Firefox's own  How to stop Firefox from making automatic connections also mentions setting network.http.speculative-parallel-limit to 0 to to stop predictive connections when a user "hovers their mouse over thumbnails on the New Tab Page or the user starts to search in the Search Bar" but no mention regarding hovering over a normal link.

- Good thing setting network.http.speculative-parallel-limit to 0 does appear to disable speculative connect on normal links too.

- One can expect Firefox to make requests in the background to its own servers for things such as checking for updates to plugins etc.

- But silently making requests to random links on a page (and connecting to those servers) simply by hovering over them is something very different.

## Tor Weekly News  August 14th, 2015

- Version 5.0, the first release in the new stable series, is based on Firefox 38ESR, which should mean improved support for HTML5 video on Youtube, as well as a host of other improvements.

- New privacy features in this release include first-party domain bar isolation of more identifier sources, and defenses from the 5.0-alpha series for keystroke (typing) fingerprinting and some instances of performance/timing fingerprinting. The first alpha release in the 5.5 series, meanwhile, fixes the recent pdf.js exploit to which users of 5.0a3 and 5.0a4 had been vulnerable; it also contains a refined version of the new font fingerprinting defenses in which Tor Browser now ships with a standard set of fonts, and prefers to use the provided fonts instead of native ones in most cases. For full changelogs and download instructions, please see the teams announcements.

- It also ships with Tor Browser 5.0, and a 32-bit GRUB EFI bootloader, so Tails should now start on some tablets with Intel Bay Trail processors, among others. For a list of all the changes in this release, please see the teams announcement.

- Whichever software you download will also require the OnioNS-common library in order to work. This is a beta testing version, so Jesse warns that it is not ready to be used on production onion services and that name-claims made now may not survive in the long term.

- If youre willing to give the system a try, however, please see Jesses message for further information, and feel free to send feedback as to how usable the system is and areas where it could be improved to the tor-dev mailing list, or file issues on the bug tracker of the relevant software package. Miscellaneous news Karsten Loesing deployed version 2.4 of Onionoo , the Tor network data observatory.

- It could also be used by other systems as a shared source of randomness. George Kadianakis published a draft proposal describing how this procedure could work.

- This works because although you can use the commitment hash to verify that the value revealed is the same as the one decided upon twelve hours ago, you cannot derive the value itself from the commitment.

## New FCC Rules Could Ban WiFi Router Firmware Modification

- This approach would be far superior to effectively banning proper security practice for the ENTIRE operating system and all utilities on the device, as the current proposal does. 1 The proposed rule which requires that manufacturers disallow firmware updates (other than signed manufacturer updates, typically provided for only a very short time), makes it much more difficult to prevent incidents such as the $45 million loss at TJX and the Target breach.

- Perhaps ESPECIALLY for devices which are a few years old. Secondly, updates from the manufacturer are not a viable solution for more sensitive government and private organizations due to the response time required.

- Manufacturer full updates were not available for several days to several months, as we first discussed the best long term solution and that solution propagated downstream from the authors, to the subsystem maintainers, distribution maintainers, OEM repackagers, and finally out to customers after testing at each level.

- These vital mitigations which protected sensitive networks in the interim would be illegal and prevented by manufacturer locks under the proposed rule.

- In simple terms, the proposal makes it illegal to manufacturer equipment which can be _quickly_ protected against new threats to our cyber security. 2 Another reason that the proposed rule is problematic is that the manufacturer default firmware, with all available features designed to be as easily accessible as possible, is not appropriate for any environment in which security is a concern.

- The vast majority of fake accounts  70,529 to 43  pretended to be female, and the users targeted were almost entirely men.

- Comments left in the code indicate some of the issues Ashley Madison's engineers had to solve: "randomizing start time so engagers don't all pop up at the same time" and "for every single state that has guest males, we want to have a chat engager."

- The AI was unsophisticated, though one type of bot would try to convince men to pay and then pass them to a real person.

## Boffins laugh at Play Store bonehead security with instant app checker

- An armada of university researchers have devised a novel method of detecting malicious applications on Android app, and by way of demonstration have dug up 127,429 shady software offerings, including some bearing exploits for a whopping 20 zero days. The scheme dubbed MassVet is the brainchild of eight researchers: Kai Chen; Peng Wang; Yeonjoon Lee; XiaoFeng Wang; Nan Zhang of Indiana University, Heqing Huang and Peng Liu of Penn State University, and Wei Zou of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

- MassVet explained in the paper [Finding Unknown Malice in 10 Seconds: Mass Vetting for New Threats at the Google-Play Scale pdf] their system dumps old signature scanning and instead compares legitimate Android frameworks to establish those that are malicious. Authors brag that it can identify a malicious app in less than 10 seconds with low false positives, and add that current vetting mechanisms stink. Unlike existing detection mechanisms, which often utilize heavyweight program analysis techniques, our approach simply compares a submitted app with all those already on a market, focusing on the difference between those sharing a similar UI structure (indicating a possible repackaging relation), and the commonality among those seemingly unrelated.

- This analysis is made scalable by its simple, static nature and the feature projection techniques that enable a cloud-based, fast search for view/code differences and similarities.  The gathering of ivory tower minds say of the zero-day malware, three load and execute dynamic suspicious code; one takes sneaky photos; another modifies the booting sequence of other apps; seven rip sensitive user data like SIM card, serial, and telephone number, and several spew adware. The presence of these activities makes us believe that very likely they are actually zero-day malware, they say.

- The research fleet finds Google more than a quarter of the time will merely ban the player, not the payload, allowing other net scum to run the same malicious code.

- Actually, among the 2125 reappeared apps, 604 confirmed malware (28.4 percent) showed up in the Play Store unchanged, with the same MD5 and same names.

## Prepare to be Thunderstruck: What if 'deuszu' ISN'T the Ashley Madison hacker?

- Security researcher Brian Krebs last week named whoever is behind the Twitter account deuszu as likely having had a hand in the Ashley Madison hack.

- And in 2015 the Ashley Madison hackers made the companys work computers play the song Thunderstruck as well. The image below shows deuszus tweet from August 4, 2012.

-  To form a counter-argument, consider the other news grabbing global attention in late July 2012? Iranian nuke plants rocked in midnight heavy metal blast  a tale of something odd going on in Iran emerged in late July of that year. Its not really too much of a stretch to think that in early August 2012, deuszu might have been listening to Thunderstruck, based on his interest in infosec news and the level of media attention mentioning the song at the time. Even deuszus later use of the tune in defacements he tweeted seems like simple imitation of what had happened in Iran. The claim that the Impact Team hackers managed to make Ashley Madison employees computers play AC/DCs Thunderstruck in 2015, and a screenshot showing deuszu once listened to the same song in 2012, is hardly forensic proof deuszu was responsible for the Ashley Madison hack. Who knew what, first? The second point that bothers me is to attribute this hack to deuszu based on a belief that Twitter provides the best  or only  timeline for the hack. Krebs assertion that Twitter account deuszu appears to be closely connected to the Ashley Madison hack appears to rest on this tweet:

-  Thadeus Zu may well have been the first to post about it on Twitter on 17 July (without linking to the dumps), but frankly, tweeting about a breaking story  already announced online for more than 48 hours  seems a pretty crummy indication of potential guilt in perpetrating the original hack.

## IoT baby monitors STILL revealing live streams of sleeping kids

- Isolated real-world reports of hacking of baby monitors date back at least two years, so its not as if the problem is new. Last year privacy watchdogs at the ICO warned parents to change the default passwords on webcams to stop perverts snooping on kids. The warning followed a security flap created by the site, hosted in Russia, that streamed live footage ranging from CCTV networks to built-in cameras from baby monitors.

- Thereafter, a hacker could login at will to view the stream of any camera of their choosing Ten vulnerabilities reported to affected vendors by Rapid7 were disclosed at the High Technology Crime Investigation Association (HTCIA) conference on Tuesday, 2 September.

- The other security issues raised, especially those related to exposed remote access protocols and featuring hardcoded credentials, can be risky depending on their network accessibility, Rapid7 warns. All of the tested devices run a fully-fledged operating system and therefore offer a point of attack for purposes other than abusing the baby monitors intended functionality. Rapid7 told affected manufacturers and US-CERT about the bugs it found back in early July, but many of vulnerabilities remain unpatched two months later. Vendors exhibited widely varied responses to the reported problems, as a white paper (pdf) from Rapid7 explains.  During the course of the vulnerability disclosure process, we saw vendors exhibit the entire range of possible responses.

- On the exemplary side, one vendor, Philips N.V., had an established protocol for handling incoming product vulnerabilities, which included using a documented PGP key to encrypt communications around this sensitive material.

- Weaved, a provider of an IoT-in-the-cloud framework for Philips, was especially open with and responsive to the authors of this paper.  Rapid7 has published more details of its research (and further background material) on its Internet of Things microsite.

## Microsoft backports data slurp to Windows 7 and 8 via patches

- We recently mused, half seriously, whether the entire point of the Windows 10 upgrade was to harvest your personal information.

- All the updates can be removed post-installation  but all ensure the OS reports data to Microsoft even when asked not to, bypassing the hosts file and (hence) third-party privacy tools.

- This data can include how long you use apps, and which features you use the most, snapshots of memory to investigate crashes, and so on. The updates are KB3068708 (Update for customer experience and diagnostic telemetry and mandatory) KB3075249 (Update that adds telemetry points to consent.exe in Windows 8.1 and Windows 7) and KB3080149 (also an Update for customer experience and diagnostic telemetry, both optional). The notes explain that diagnostic telemetry data is sent to settings-win.data.microsoft.com (64.4.54.253) over SSL.

- Privacy advocates note that the OS is hardwired to use that hostname, so trying to override the IP address it resolves to using your PCs hosts file wont work. The tools relate to Microsofts CEIP (customer experience improvement program).

- Disabling the monitoring tools is complicated, requiring tweaks via both the policy editor, and at application level. If youre not bothered by anonymised data being sent to Microsoft (or mobile data caps) then the telemetry elevations probably wont bother you. Microsofts creepy robo-buddy contextual operating service, Cortana  which has caused much of the privacy concerns, even though its fairly well explained  remains an exclusive to Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 Phone. Ghacks has a useful guide on undoing the cheeky telemetry escalation.

## 9 baby monitors wide open to hacks that expose users most private moments

- The security of Internet-connected baby monitors got a failing grade from researchers who found critical vulnerabilities in all nine of the models they reviewed. The weaknesses make it possible for hackers half a world away to perform a host of nefarious actions.

- The study reviewed the models for standard security weaknesses, such as hard-coded accounts with default passwords, unencrypted video and audio feeds, commands sent in cleartext over the Internet, and the ability to gain unauthorized control through remote shells and similar interfaces.

- If Microsoft, Apple, Google, and other companies with core competencies in software struggle so mightily to secure their wares, it only stands to reason these relative newcomers to network connectivity would have even bigger challenges.

- Most IoT devices run a version of Linux that will be woefully out of date by the time its in the homes of the people using it. The equally alarming finding out of the Rapid7 study is the response of manufactures when they received private reports of the vulnerabilities that were found.

- Some companies questioned the motives behind the research and asked why they should respond at all. People who are in the market for a baby monitor should strongly consider getting a model like this one, which offers no Internet connectivity and uses encryption to protect the video and audio stream sent between the camera and a dedicated handset.

## Stingray stung: FBI told 'get a warrant'

- 

- The US Department of Justice has moved to quell the ongoing row over the use of IMSI-catchers like Stingray, with a new policy that requires a warrant before theyre deployed. The policy, announced here, is designed to establish a higher and more consistent legal standard and increase privacy protections for the use of cell-site simulators.

- The policy takes effect immediately and applies across all DoJ agencies. The policy also addresses the understandable fear that anyones cellphone use could be caught by the devices, merely because they happened to be in the same place at the same time as a Stingray was in use. The DoJ statement notes that the policy includes data handling requirements and an agency-level implementation of an auditing program to ensure that data is deleted consistent with this policy.

- For example, when the equipment is used to locate a known cellular device, all data must be deleted as soon as that device is located, and no less than once daily. The controversial devices have been under attack from the ACLU, and lawyers in the US are working through FBI use of Stingrays in case convictions can be appealed. The new policy has been welcomed by House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who released this statement on TwitLonger. As Ive long stated, establishing a high uniform standard helps protect personal privacy and discourages abuse and mishandling of these powerful devices, he wrote. He states that the battle isnt over, since theres still secrecy around the use of geolocation technology, and Chaffetz says the DoJ should continue to produce information  including the Jones memos  to help Congress and the public understand how the federal government tracks people.

## Ashley Madison: Our site is full of women, and members are growing

- Embattled adultery website Ashley Madison has launched a rearguard action, claiming new sign-ups and more female members in the aftermath of Julys megahack. Self-styled King of Infidelity Noel Biderman quit as chief exec of Avid Life Media, the parent firm of Ashley Madison, on Friday.

- To recap, all hell has broken loose since hackers raided the Ashley Madison website in July, before leaking databases containing 36 million accounts plus source code and Bidermans company emails weeks later. Avid Life Media  which has pledged to continue running  faces class-action lawsuits as well as negative media coverage over suicides linked to the outing of its love-rat users. In addition, security researchers whove been through the leaked data reckon that not many women were using the biz.

- Separate analysis of leaked data also turned up evidence which suggested that paying $19 to delete accounts on the site left all sorts of personal information intact. Avid Life Media hit back at these criticisms on Monday with a combative statement, suggesting that recent media reports predicting the imminent demise of Ashley Madison are greatly exaggerated and decrying suggestions that few woman actually used the site. On the contrary, women outnumbered men, it claimed.  Despite having our business and customers attacked, we are growing.

- Last week, a reporter who claimed to analyse the stolen data made incorrect assumptions about the meaning of fields contained in the leaked data.

- They want evidence rather then a flat dismissal of criticism. If Avid Life wants to dispute the male:female ratio, explain how to interpret the data differently.

## At LAST: RC4 gets the stake through the heart

- 

- One of the security sets most intractable problems is the stubborn endurance of old standards  the kind of thing that left SSLv3 hanging around so that people didnt have to weed out fallback code, for example. Well, at least one of securitys code zombies, the insecure and inadequate RC4 crypto algorithm, has been formally abandoned by Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft in coordinated announcements.

- The three outfits have agreed to unplug RC4s life-support early in 2016. Their decision comes a couple of months after yet-another RC4 attack was able to recover RC4-encrypted cookies within 52 hours. Mozilla says the only variable between Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer will be their release cycles. Mozilla that its defaults will be no-RC4 in version 44 expected in January (but users will still be able to explicitly set a preference if they need it and know what theyre doing). Disabling RC4 will mean that Firefox will no longer connect to servers that require RC4.

- The data we have indicate that while there are still a small number of such servers, Firefox users encounter them at very low rates, the Mozilla note says. Google says its going to deprecate RC4 entirely sometime in January or February 2016. Microsoft is disabling RC4 by default in Internet Explorer and Edge in a similar time-frame.

## Ashley Madison hack miscreants may have earned $6,400 from leak

- Some blackmail attempts against victims of the ongoing Ashley Madison saga resulted in several  albeit modest  pay outs, according to new research. Extortionists seized on the data dump of the cheaters website database last month with demands to pay up, or risk having their friends and family told about their dalliances, as previously reported.

- An unknown group or individuals (probably unrelated to the self-styled Impact Team who pulled off the hack) sent extortion emails demanding Bitcoin for silence. Toshiro Nishimura, research analyst at spam filtering firm Cloudmark, began investigating whether any payments had actually been made by looking at signs on the Bitcoin blockchain. He first determined that a sample of Bitcoin addresses used to send extortionate demands were all freshly minted.

- This is an unsurprising discovery by itself but it did mean that some potential avenues of further inquiry were blocked off. All the scam emails consistently demanded exactly 1.05 BTC from their victims, so Nishimura searched the blockchain for transactions paying exactly that amount to infer if such extortion demands were being paid. He found 67 suspicious transactions totalling 70.35 BTC or approximately $15,814 within the extortion time frame of approximately four days.

- This is more than a statistical glitch, according to Nishimura. We can strongly reject the null hypothesis that the incidence of matching transactions during the extortion period followed a Poisson distribution at the historical rate, thus allowing us to infer that perhaps the 40 per cent of the 67 transactions totalling approximately $6,400 may be attributable to victims paying the blackmail, Nishimura concludes in a blog post. Nishimura adds a caveat that his findings are far from conclusive and, in any case, incomplete.

- Such analysis could potentially help law enforcement to de-anonymise and pursue the perpetrators, according to Nishimura. The Cloudmark security expert theorises that the whole Ashley Madison email extortion scam may be the brainchild of an opportunistic professional spammer or spammers(s). For a spammer with pre-existing infrastructure and tools, this extortion campaign could have yielded a worthwhile sum for very little effort, Nishimura argues. All the blackmailer had to do was download the Ashley Madison data, extract the email addresses, generate a Bitcoin address for each victim and send out the emails, he added.

## Pwn2Own Tokyo hacking contest trashed, US export rules blamed

- The Cold War has reached out a long-dead hand to stifle the Pwn2Own hackfest in Tokyo, with the Wassenaar Arrangement blamed for the events cancelation. Organized by the HP TippingPoint-backed Zero Day Initiative, Pwn2Own slings bug bounties to researchers.

- But it seems that this year, nobody could work out whether vulnerabilities revealed in Tokyo could be brought back to the US without breaking the Wassenaar treaty  which is undergoing a review by Uncle Sams lawyers, and its final form is still up in the air. An HP spokesperson told The Register via email that the Zero-Day Initiative made the decision to cancel the event, writing: Due to the complexity of obtaining real-time import/export licenses in countries that participate in the Wassenaar Arrangement, the ZDI has notified conference organizer Dragos Ruiu that it will not be holding the Pwn2Own contest at PacSecWest in November. Ruiu had previously tweeted that HP pulled its sponsorship and that he intends to try and host some kind of hackfest in its place:  The first bona fide casualty of the Wassenaar changes: HP wont be doing PWN2OWN Mobile in Japan due to new export restrictions.

- But  dragosr (@dragosr) September 1, 2015  I still like hacker circuses, and have ordered my own RF Isolation cage for Japan.

- Stand by for details.  dragosr (@dragosr) September 1, 2015  Like the Internet well route around export blocks, solve by handing bugs over to local reps in .jp dont need to feed bugs back to US  dragosr (@dragosr) September 1, 2015 He also told Ars Technica that HP had lawyered up to the tune of US$1 million to test the legal risk of Pwn2Own in a post-Wassenaar world, but decided it was untenable. HP confirmed to The Register that it had worked with its lawyers on the issue, but wouldnt comment on how much it had cost. Hackers had already expressed their concern that Pwn2Own was at risk, since its open to the interpretation that trafficking flaws across the US border is banned in light of the Wassenaar Arrangement. The text added last year to Wassenaar, which was originally a Cold War-era arms-control pact, forbids the export of:  Software specially designed or modified to avoid detection by monitoring tools, or to defeat protective countermeasures, of a computer or network-capable device, and performing any of the following:

- (a) The extraction of data or information, from a computer or network-capable device, or the modification of system or user data; or (b) The modification of the standard execution path of a program or process in order to allow the execution of externally provided instructions.  As The Register noted in June, that language could stretch far beyond hacks and exploits, since it could also be read to mean that antivirus cant be exported without a US government license. While the US has toned down its approach to implementing the Wassenaar treaty, Ars says the problem for Pwn2Own is Japans cumbersome and vague implementation of the agreement. Its also colossally convenient for HP, which is apparently considering ejecting its Tipping Point biz ahead of its corporate split.

## Tor Weekly News  August 30th, 2015

- This means that they are typically quite hard for humans to remember, unless the hidden service operator  whether by chance or by making repeated attempts  hits upon a memorable string, as in the case of Facebooks hidden service. The problem, writes George Kadianakis, is that due to these user-unfriendly strings, many people dont verify the whole onion address, they just trust the onion link or verify the first few characters.

- After discussions with other researchers in this area, George drew up a proposal to incorporate visual information into the verification process: So when TBB connects to a hidden service, it uses the onion address to generate a randomart or key poem and makes them available for the user to examine. As with all new development proposals, however, there are many unanswered questions.

- In short, Some real UX research needs to be done here, before we decide something terrible. If you have clear and constructive feedback to offer on this unusual but important proposal, please send it to the tor-dev mailing list. Tor-enabled Debian mirrors Richard Hartmann, Peter Palfrader, and Jonathan McDowell have set up the first official onion service mirrors of the Debian operating systems software package infrastructure.

- Are you interested in making the world a better place by putting your development skills to use in a globally used free software project?

## Attacks accessing Mac keychain without permission date back to 2011

- Now theres evidence the underlying weakness has been exploited for four years. As documented by Twitter user @noarfromspace, the keychain-penetrating technique was carried out in 2011 by a piece of malware known as DevilRobber.

- The then new threat caught the attention of security researchers because it commandeered a Macs graphics card and CPU to perform the mathematical calculations necessary to mine Bitcoins, something that was novel at the time.

- Less obvious was the DevilRobbers use of the AppleScript programming language to locate a window requesting permission to access the Keychain and then simulate a mouse click over the OK button. Thomas Reed, who is director of Mac offerings at security firm Malwarebytes, said he tested the AppleScript on the current version of Apples OS X and found it worked, as long as a user had already allowed the app running the script to control the Mac.

- On Monday, Reed disclosed the same technique was being used by the Genieo adware installer to gain access to a Safari extensions list thats protected inside the Mac Keychain.

- The Mac keychain is the protected place storing account passwords and cryptographic keys. I think that Apple needs to isolate that particular window, Reed told Ars on Wednesday.

## The Onion Router is being cut up and making security pros cry

- IBM claims there were around 180,000 malicious traffic events in the USA between January 1 and May 10 this year, with 150,000 in the Netherlands, and more than 50,000 in each of Romania, France, Luxembourg and Uraguay. While the rise of ransomware is worrying, the biggest attacks emanating from TOR exit nodes are familiar old favourites: SQL injection, vulnerability scanning, and denial-of-service. TOR is also providing an infrastructure for command-and-control networks, the report states. The report also speculates that wrong-doing is shifting from simple financial attacks to something that looks more like industrial espionage.

- It says the top two industries attacked in its study were information and communications, followed by manufacturing. A likely explanation is that these attacks are not after money  theyre attempts to steal intellectual property and/or spy on company operations, the report says. X-Force threat researcher John Kuhn also told de-anonymised TOR hidden services, licit-and-illicit goods providore Agora has posted an announcement to Reddit that its suspending services. The announcement says there are interested parties who have the resources to launch a de-anonymisation attack against the service. We have a solution in the works which will require big changes into our software stack which we believe will mitigate such problems, but unfortunately it will take time to implement.

- Additionally, we have recently been discovering suspicious activity around our servers which led us to believe that some of the attacks described in the research could be going on and we decided to move servers once again, however this is only a temporary solution, the statement continues. Noted cryptography expert from Johns Hopkins Univeristy Matthew Green responded succinctly:  I wouldnt trust a Tor hidden service farther than I could throw the server.

- Not in 2015.  Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) August 25, 2015 Agora reckons itll be back, but in the meantime its trying to clear current orders, and is telling people not to send Bitcoin to any deposit addresses it hosts.

- However, this is only a temporary solution. The message said operators were working on a solution to block the attacks and planned to bring Agora back online once it was ready.

- In the meantime, they said, it would be unsafe to continue conducting business as usual. The suspension comes as a surprise, since Tor Project officials have downplayed the novelty of the new attack method and the likelihood it could be carried out in practice.

## Yet another Android app security bug: This time 'everything is affected'

- Yet another potentially serious security flaw has been revealed in Android. This time the problem involves the mobile operating systems ability to run more than one app at once  as opposed to its handling of multimedia messages, which was the crux of a cyber* of vulnerabilities last month.

- The latest security blunder opens the door to criminals who want to spy on device owners, steal login details, install ransomware, and so on, it is claimed. Were told the vulnerability can be exploited to show a spoofed user interface, controlled by an attacker, when someone starts an app: the owner will not be aware that they are typing into another program masquerading as a legit application. The enabled attacks can affect all latest Android versions and all apps (including the most privileged system apps) installed on the system, warned Chuangang Ren, a security researcher from Penn State University. A paper on the vulnerability [PDF]  presented at the USENIX Security 15 conference in Washington DC last week  explained:  Android multitasking provides rich features to enhance user experience and offers great flexibility for app developers to promote app personalization.

- Since many apps depend on the current multitasking design, defeating task hijacking is not easy.  The five researchers  Chuangang Ren and Peng Liu, both from the Pennsylvania State University; Yulong Zhang, Hui Xue, and Tao Wei, all from FireEye  have notified the Android team about the findings of their research.

- Their 16-page paper, Towards Discovering and Understanding Task Hijacking in Android, outlines the risk in greater depth, as well as suggesting possible mitigation techniques. A quick overview of the vulnerability can be found in the video below.  Youtube Video  El Reg asked Google to comment, but were yet to hear back from the IT giant.

-  Updated to add A Google spokeswoman reckons the researchers have overstated the threat, and have failed to factor in protection mechanisms in place in Android.

## Samsung smart fridge leaves Gmail logins open to attack

- Update Security researchers have discovered a potential way to steal users Gmail credentials from a Samsung smart fridge. Pen Test Partners discovered the MiTM (man-in-the-middle) vulnerability that facilitated the exploit during an IoT hacking challenge at the recent DEF CON hacking conference.

- Security shortcomings mean that hackers who manage to jump on to the same network can potentially steal Google login credentials from their neighbours. The internet-connected fridge is designed to display Gmail Calendar information on its display, explained Ken Munro, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners.

- If so, the next step would be to figure out the password, then use the certificate data to authenticate to the fridge and send commands to it over the air. Pen Test Partners Pedro Venda added: We wanted to pull the terminal unit out of the fridge to get physical access to things like a USB port and serial or JTAG interfaces, but ran out of time.

- The MiTM alone is enough to expose a users Gmail creds. The team at Pen Test Partners is doing more and more IoT security and hacking research of late.

- Protecting our consumers privacy is our top priority, and we work hard every day to safeguard our valued Samsung users.

## Mobile device screens recorded using the Certifi-gate vulnerability

- Users have the option to share scan results with Check Point. The Certifi-gate scanner app has nearly 100,000 downloads on Google Play, and Check Point has received over 30,000 anonymous scan results from users.

- These anonymous stats have allowed Check Point to access the level of exposure to the vulnerability across different devices and vendors. More than 40 per cent of all the scan samples showed devices were vulnerable to Certifi-gate. And 16 per cent of samples showed a vulnerable plug-in was installed on the device, allowing any malicious application to take full control of the device by exploiting the installed plug-in. In fact, a handful of scanned devices had already been exploited with a specific app from a UK-based company, available from the Play Store and which has already seen 100,000 and 500,000 downloads. The Recordable Activator app, developed by Invisibility, uses the Certifi-gate vulnerability, bypassing the Android permission model to access system level resources. Avi Basham, a mobile security researcher at Check Point, explained that the app is able to record the screen on devices onto which it is installed.

- Users of affected devices are not notified that this is happening and the whole process is in any case something that should not be possible on devices that are not jailbroke. It exploits the Certifi-gate vulnerability to gain system permissions, Basham told El Reg.

- This should violate Play Store conditions. Christopher Fraser, a representative of Invisibility, responded to our queries by explaining that developers did not set out to exploit a vulnerability.  Recordable is screen recorder  able to make to record the screen via four possible methods: activation via USB, Android 5 projection, root, and via the TeamViewer plugin (which saved people having to activate on older version of Android).

- Hundreds of thousands of kids use it to run their YouTube channels.  El Reg also quizzed Google, which confirmed that the app had been suspended. The Certifi-gate vulnerability is a risk for apps downloaded from third-party app stores as well as Google Play, although scanning using the Check Point tool has only turned up issues on Google Play thus far. Certifi-gate takes advantages of security shortcomings in architecture of popular mobile Remote Support Tools (RSTs) used by most every Android device manufacturers and network service provider. Malicious applications could gain unrestricted access to a targeted device by impersonating plug-ins for legitimate tools such as Team Viewer, as explained in greater depth in a blog post by Check Point here.

## Major Android remote-access vulnerability is now being exploited [Updated]

- Based on anonymized data collected from users of an app designed to check for a newly revealed vulnerability in many Android devices, Check Point discovered that one application in the Google Play store is exploiting the vulnerability to gain a high level of access to the Android OS, bypassing user permissionsand bypassing Googles security scans of Play applications to do so.Update:A Google spokesperson told Ars that the offending app has been suspended in the Play store. Further ReadingWaiting for Androids inevitable security ArmageddonEditorial: Androids update strategy doesnt scale, and thats recipe for disaster.

- And theres no easy way for Google or phone manufacturers alone to patch the problem. At the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, Check Points Ohad Bobrov and Avi Bashan presented research into an Android vulnerability introduced by software installed by phone manufacturers and cellular carriers that could affect millions of devices.

- But in fact once installed from the Google Play store, the app downloaded a vulnerable version of the TeamViewer plug-in from another source, Shaulov told Ars.

- Because the plug-in is signed by various device manufacturers, Check Point researchers wrote in their blog post, its considered trusted by Android, and is granted system-level permissions.

- If someone a year from now can trick you into installing a vulnerable version, theyll still be able to take control. Based on Check Points findings, thats exactly what Invisibility Ltd is doing for what is advertised as a legitimate application.

## Android in user-chosen lockscreen patterns are grimly predictable SHOCKER

- People choose predictable Android lock screen patterns just like they pick predictable passwords. Research by Marte Lge, a recent graduate from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, confirmed that the problems people have in setting up secure passwords and PINs are replicated in the field of Android lockscreen patterns.

- Writing on the Sophos Naked Security blog, John Zorabedian noted: Oils in your fingers leave visible streaks on your device screen.

- This simple fact is often exploited by hackers, as well as the agencies watching you. Full Disk Encryption wont save you if your lock pattern is L  as in loser, she concluded. Other researchers have uncovered pattern password security problems affecting Microsofts mobile technology, but the whole area is under-researched compared with the volumes of studies looking at conventional password slackness.

-  Bootnote In fairness, it ought to be pointed out that users predictable lockscreen practices cant be blamed on a lack of advice on the subject from Google.

- For example, some pointers on choosing harder-to-guess screen lock patterns can be found on a Google Nexus support page here.

## Regularities in Android Lock Patterns

- Marte Lge, a 2015 graduate of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, recently collected and analyzed almost 4,000 ALPs as part of her masters thesis.

- She found that a large percentage of them  44 percent  started in the top left-most node of the screen.

- The average number of nodes was about five, meaning there were fewer than 9,000 possible pattern combinations.

- A significant percentage of patterns had just four nodes, shrinking the pool of available combinations to 1,624.

- More often than not, patterns moved from left to right and top to bottom, another factor that makes guessing easier.

## Over 225,000 Apple Accounts Compromised Via iOS Malware

- An anonymous reader writes: Researchers from Palo Alto Networks and WeipTech have unearthed a scheme that resulted in the largest known Apple account theft caused by malware.

- All in all, some 225,000 valid Apple accounts have been compromised.

- Most of the victims are Chinese  the malware is distributed through third-party Cydia repositories in China  but users in other countries have also been affected (European countries, the U.S., Australia, South Korea, and so on).

- "The malware hooks system processes through MobileSubstrate, and steals Apple account usernames, passwords and device GUID by intercepting iTunes traffic on the device," Palo Alto researcher Claud Xiao explained.

- "KeyRaider steals Apple push notification service certificates and private keys, steals and shares App Store purchasing information, and disables local and remote unlocking functionalities on iPhones and iPads.

## Chinese mobe market suffers pre-pwned Android pandemic

- Security researchers have discovered more examples of pre-installed malware on Android smartphones. G DATA found that more than two dozen phones from different manufacturers were already compromised straight out of the box.

- Kit from manufacturers including Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi have pre-installed espionage functions in the firmware.

- G DATA suspects that middlemen modified the device software to steal user data and inject their own advertising to earn money. Other possibilities include unintentional infection through compromised devices in the supply chain (a problem which affected Vodafone Spain back in 2010) or intentional interference by government spies.

- Many of the models implicated in the malfeasance sell well in China. The pre-pwned device issue has become a perennial problem for privacy-conscious smartphone users.

- Regardless of blame, the incident illustrated the general risk, more examples of which are not hard to find. Late last year Palo Alto Networks discovered that high-end Androids from Coolpad came pre-pwned with the CoolReaper malware.

## Salesforce plugs silly website XSS hole, hopes nobody spotted it

- A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on Salesforces website might have been abused to pimp phishing attacks or hijack user accounts.

- Fortunately the bug has been resolved, apparently before it caused any harm. Cloud app and security firm Elastica said the issue affected a Salesforce sub-domain   admin.salesforce.com   and came from a failure to sanitise user-submitted inputs. The oversight means that miscreants are able to push JavaScript through a newsletter sign-up box that ought to only accept email addresses.

- This JavaScript might have been harnessed to steal cookies and session identifiers, creating a possible account hijack risk.

- More straightforwardly, an attacker might have abused the security weakness to inject pop-up windows in users browsers or otherwise redirected Salesforce users towards phishing sites. The security flaw might also created a mechanism to sling malicious scripts, according to Elastica. The vulnerability was not present in  login.salesforce.com  but in another subdomain of Salesforce, meaning it posed a lesser risk.

- We investigated and remediated a minor vulnerability impacting the blog site admin.salesforce.com, which is not connected to the Salesforce application or customer data.

## AVA: A Social Engineering Vulnerability Scanner

- First, it integrates with corporate directories such as Active Directory and social media sites like LinkedIn to map the connections between employees, as well as important outside contacts.

- Bell calls this the real org chart. Hackers can use such information to choose people they ought to impersonate while trying to scam employees.

- From there, AVA users can craft custom phishing campaigns, both in email and Twitter, to see how employees respond.

- Finally, and most importantly, it helps organizations track the results of these campaigns.

- Opinions expressed are not necessarily those of Resilient Systems, Inc.

## Linux Foundation releases PARANOID internal infosec guide

- He says the guidelines should be adjusted if they are out of step with organisational risk appetites. The first section covers buying hardware and lists SecureBoot as a critical feature, and a lack of firewire and Thunderbolt ports as as a bonus.

- Here password-protected UEFI boot mode is a must. An admins operating system distro of choice has to meet a dozen critical requirements around fast patching, verification, and native disk encryption.

- The latter must include Linux Unified Key Setup full disk encryption, including swap, an unprivileged admin group account, and lots of robust passwords. The hardened Linux geek will need to globally disable firewire and Thunderbolt modules where they exist, filter incoming ports with firewalls, disable shd, and schedule automatic updates. To be a fully-paranoid neckbeard, admins must install rkhunter and an intrusion detection system, and, crucially, maintain it (including running checks from a trusted environment). Firefox is your browser of choice for accessing trusted sites.

- Admins should outfit their Chromium plow with Privacy Badger and HTTPS Everywhere (this correspondent recommends ScriptSafe to fully ruin the shininess and ad revenues of websites). Chrome should also be dumped in a VM where possible, a configuration that is surprisingly workable if RAM-intensive, so says Ryabitsev. The doc suggests VMs to compartmentalise applications, and points to the the Qubes-OS project as a suitable environment. Password managers are a good idea; separate password managers for untrusted and trusted browsers are even better for the paranoid trophy seekers. The guide does not touch on hardware data destruction, but robotics engineer zoz has offered some tips for the slightly nervous to fully paranoid.

- The easy way is to remove disk platters with a couple of Torx screwdrivers, rubbing with a rare earth magnet, crushing in a manner offering the admin the most gratification, burning with fire, and dispersal among city limits. Truely paranoid admins seeking GCHQ Five Eyes-assured obliteration will need to dabble in thermal, serious kinetic, and electric means of hard drive destruction.
