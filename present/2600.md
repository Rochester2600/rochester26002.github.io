## Quantum Teleportation Achieved Over 7km of Cable

- picture three people involved -- Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice and Bob want to share cryptographic keys, and to do that, they need Charlie's help. Alice sends a particle to Charlie, while Bob entangles two particles and sends just one of them to Charlie. Charlie then measures the two particles he's received from each of them, so that they can no longer be differentiated -- and that results in the quantum state of Alice's particle being transferred to Bob's entangled particle. So basically, the quantum state of Alice's particle eventually ends up in Bob's particle, via a way station in the form of Charlie.

## Microsoft Signature PC Requirements Now Blocks Linux Installation: Reports

-  Microsoft Signature PC Requirements Now Blocks Linux Installation: Reports

- This user found out that his Lenovo Yoga 900 ISK2 UltraBook has the SSD in a proprietary RAID mode which Linux does not understand and the BIOS is also locked down so it could not be turned off.

- "Even worse, as the original poster said, "[t]he Yoga 900 ISK2 at Best Buy is not labeled as a Signature Edition PC, but apparently it is one, and Lenovo's agreement with Microsoft includes making sure Linux can't be installed."

- As some commenter said: "If you buy a computer with this level of lockdown you should be told.

- " There is also a report on ZDNet which looks very understanding towards Lenovo, but the fact remains: the SSD is locked down in a proprietary RAID mode that cannot be turned off.

## Uber's Terrifying 'Ghost Drivers' Are Freaking Out Passengers in China

- Several Chinese publications are reporting that "ghost drivers" are frightening Uber passengers into paying for trips they didn't take.

- Passengers in Tianjin, Qingdao, Chengdu, Beijing, Shanghai and Suzhou have been canceling Uber rides after seeing creepy driver profile pictures pop up in the app.

- According to Chinese news site Sixth Tone, the point of these ghostly profiles is to scare passengers into canceling the trip, so they are fined for a few yuan (less than a dollar), which goes to the driver.

- Other passengers have reported seeing their rides accepted, but then their trips were "started" by the driver on the app before they even get to the car.

- Passengers can however eventually be reimbursed by Uber China if they lodge a complaint.

## Hacking Wireless Tire-Pressure Monitoring System

- Research paper: "Security and Privacy Vulnerabilities of In-Car Wireless Networks: A Tire Pressure Monitoring System Case Study," by Ishtiaq Rouf, Rob Miller, Hossen Mustafa, Travis Taylor, Sangho Oh, Wenyuan Xu, Marco Gruteser, Wade Trapper, Ivan Seskar:

- The security and privacy implications of such in-car networks, however, have are not well understood as their transmissions propagate beyond the confines of a car's body.

- We show that eavesdropping is easily possible at a distance of roughly 40m from a passing vehicle.

- Further, current protocols do not employ authentication and vehicle implementations do not perform basic input validation, thereby allowing for remote spoofing of sensor messages.

- Finally, the paper concludes with a set of recommendations for improving the privacy and security of tire pressure monitoring systems and other forthcoming in-car wireless sensor networks.

## Bug that hit Firefox and Tor browsers was hard to spotnow we know why

- A recently fixed security vulnerability that affected both the Firefox and Tor browsers had a highly unusual characteristic that caused it to threaten users only during temporary windows of time that could last anywhere from two days to more than a month. As a result, the cross-platform, malicious code-execution risk most recently visited users of browsers based on the Firefox Extended Release on September 3 and lasted until Tuesday, or a total of 17 days.

- That meant an attacker who had a man-in-the-middle position and a forged certificate impersonating a Mozilla server could surreptitiously install malware on a user's machine.

- Such an attack, however, was only viable at certain periods when Mozilla-supplied "pins" expired. "It comes around every once in a while," Ryan Duff, an independent researcher and former member of the US Cyber Command, told Ars, referring to the vulnerability.

- And when pinning wasn't enforced, it was possible for man-in-the-middle attackers to use forged certificates to install malicious add-on updates when the add-on was obtained through Mozilla's add-on site.

- The irregular windows in which the vulnerability was active likely contributed to some of the skepticism that initially greeted movrcx's report and made it hard to spot the problem. "Id be lying if I said luck didnt play a significant role in the discovery of this bug," Duff wrote in the above-linked postmortem.

## Victoria Police warn of malware-laden USB sticks in letterboxes

- Police in the Australian State of Victoria have warned citizens not to trust un-marked USB sticks that appear in their letterboxes. The warning, issued today, says The USB drives are believed to be extremely harmful and members of the public are urged to avoid plugging them into their computers or other devices.  

- Upon inserting the USB drives into their computers victims have experienced fraudulent media streaming service offers, as well as other serious issues. Only the suburb of Pakenham in Victoria's capital Melbourne has experienced the dodgy stick drop, but Victoria Police nonetheless saw fit to issue a state-wide alert. The Register is utterly un-surprised that some people plugged in the drives, as we've previously reported that half of people who find a USB stick in a carpark will plug it in and a USBs-left-in-car-parks phishing scam.

- And who could forget the attempt at industrial espionage that saw USB sticks left in the parking lot of Dutch chemical giant DSM? The latter two attacks were targeted.

- Perhaps the perps behind this USB drop had a particular target in mind.

- Or perhaps USB sticks are now so cheap, and the profits to be had from cracking even home computers so large, that scattering a few dozen sticks is a crime that pays?

## Vim 8.0 released [LWN.net]

- Async I/O in particular should make a number of more complex plugins significantly less painful (and in some cases, less impossible).

-  Vim 8.0 released  Posted Sep 13, 2016 14:18 UTC (Tue) by nye (guest, #51576) [Link]   It looks like it should do, although obviously plugins will need to be updated to support it, which could take a long time.  I'm also hoping for things like being able to run pep8 when saving, which currently blocks the UI for too long to be a realistic option unless you're running on a super powerful machine.  Actually there are quite a few checkers that I have running at save, where blocking for a second or two isn't too awful, which perhaps will be able to run near-continuously in the glorious async future. 

-  Vim 8.0 released  Posted Sep 14, 2016 12:02 UTC (Wed) by jpnp (subscriber, #63341) [Link]  I don't think it was, until, frustrated by the fact that patches for features such as async were being turned down, Neovim forked the code and set about some major refactoring as well as adding new features.

- and is apparently a nicer place to develop in (the few times I've been in the Vim codebase were, thankfully, brief). 

- Large file support (as in, quickly loading and navigating them, not just loading them) has been the one feature I've found in proprietary editors that I haven't found an open source match for...

## iOS 10 Is Surfacing Hardcore Porn GIFs in iMessage

- The company's revamped iMessage -- and the inclusion of a range of extensions -- isn't rendering the best of results.

- Hours after the release of iOS 10 -- which caused issues for some users -- news outlets noticed a "highly sexual" My Little Pony GIF was appearing in searches when curious minds searched for the word "butt".

- The Verge explains the horror: A woman who emailed The Verge this afternoon says her eight-year-old daughter, while trying to send a message to her dad, was presented with "a very explicit image" of "a woman giving oral sex to a well endowed male."

- GIF search is one of the new features built into iMessage in iOS 10.

- "Reminds me of Apple's old porn problems.

## 35,000 ARRIS cable modems at risk from firmware dumper bot

- Hackers have exploited a back door in more than 35,000 ARRIS modems, making off with firmware and certificates, according to security researcher Bernardo Rodrigues. ARRIS makes cable modems and associated home networking kit.

- It recently shipped a patch to address 2015 zero day which at the time of disclosure impacted 600,000 ARRIS modems.  

- The remaining as-yet-un-patched modems are located across the United States, Mexico, and Brazil, but the number of infected devices could be much higher, according to Rodrigues, since the Luabot malware used in the attacks shutters external access to lock out rival attackers and researchers. Rodrigues identified the vulnerability which involved twin flaws, essentially a backdoor in a backdoor.

- His bug took the form of a shell within a hidden administrator feature that used a hardcoded password based on a known seed. Hackers could enter the default SSH root user password of 'arris' and then punch in the password of the day in the subsequent spawned mini_cli shell. The second-tier backdoor was based on the modem's serial number and was initially hosed-down by Arris as a low-risk flaw.  Youtube Video  Professional box-popper Rodrigues cooked up a keygen, complete with a chiptune, which would generate passwords for the backdoor-backdoor. He now says VXers have been exploiting the vulnerability using the LuaBot malware, first detailed earlier this month by "unixfreaxjp", author of industry blog Malware Must Die. "I received some reports that malware creators are remotely exploiting those devices in order to dump the modem's configuration and steal private certificates," Rodrigues says. "Some users also reported that those certificates are being sold for Bitcoin to modem cloners all around the world. "The report from [unixfreaxjp] also points that the LuaBot is being used for flooding and Distributed denial of service attacks.

- " Luabot has a detection rating on Virus Total of three from 55 anti virus engines. The Luabot author told known French security researcher x0rz he was a programmer not affiliated with any hacking group. He says he does not like the attention on his malware and says reverse engineers often bork analysis due to cross-pollination with other infections on routers. The hacker has included comments of "happy reversing" in his binaries as a note to security researchers, and claims he is not attempting to cause harm to router owners. "Internet-of-things botnets are becoming a thing: manufacturers have to start building secure and reliable products, ISPs need to start shipping updated devices and firmware, and the final user has to keep his home devices patched and secured," Rodrigues says.

## Teenager uncovers route to free Web surfing on T-Mobile network

- Jacob Ajit, a 17-year-old student at the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax, Virginia, was bored and screwing around with a smartphone that had service and a SIM for T-Mobile's prepaid phone service.

- This requires the phone to be able to connect to T-Mobile's network to do so, essentially blocking access to the rest of the Internet through a capture portal until the account is activated.

- But Ajit found that the Speedtest mobile app worked even when the phone's data plan hadn't been activatedlikely as a marketing tool to demonstrate the speed of T-Mobile's 4G network. By capturing some of the data sent to Speedtest when connected to a shared network connection through his Mac (he used mitmproxy to do so), Ajit discovered the graphics used in the Speedtest app to measure download speed were hosted on a number of different sites.

- Taking his finding to its conclusion, he set up a simple Web proxy on a remote server using Glype, again using the /speedtest directory in his URL... and it worked.

- Ars attempted to contact T-Mobile for comment on Ajit's findings, which he said he has reported to the company.

## The DNC Hack: October Surprises & The Second OPM

-   While the data may not be as invasive as an SF86, the fact of the matter is that every democrat that the DNC had access to is now up for grabs on the internet because of a hacker, or nation state, or hacker of a nation state, has dumped it all there.

- Whether it be the dump previously put on the net by Guccifer_2.0 or the last one this week, the upshot is that large chunks of raw data are out there with some kinda personal content if you are a Dem and that I think should give one pause. In a discussion I had the other day with REDACTED about the election and the mess we are in generally as a populace, the natural turn things took were pretty fucking bleak.

- Look at the choices we have and then look at all the rhetoric about Russia potentially tampering with the election on the electronic warfare level and then stop to think about what has yet to come... October.

- The October surprise though seems to be being prepped or peppered already by the likes of Guccifer 2 and @DCleaks_ never mind Wikileaks.

- With the dump Guccifer put out this week while virtually speaking at a security conference (talk about flying planes sideways stunt hacking elections!) we just have more data to use and possibly abuse that might be valuable toward affecting the election process. So when you see Mike Rogers at the podium saying Russia might attack the election electronically you might want to just yell back They already did asshat! Just sayin... K.

## De-anonymizing website visitors via FB timing attacks

- Mit einer normalen Internetverbindung sollte die Demo nur ein paar Sekunden dauern, auch in der U-Bahn funktionierte es auf dem Smartphone ziemlich schnell.

- 14.000 Postleitzahlen einen Post bei Facebook anzulegen (auch wenn ich das teilautomatisiert habe), ist die Ortserkennung hier beschrnkt auf Stdte mit mehr als 100.000 Einwohnern.

- Standardmig sind sie in allen gngigen Browsern leider immer noch aktiviert.Wer weiterhin tolle, auf den User abgestimmte Produktvorschlge bekommen mchte, kann die Einstellung ja so lassen, alle anderen sollten sie deaktivieren. Warum ist das schlimm, wenn man so genaue personenbezogene Daten von einem User herausfinden kann?

- Nun, wenn man wei, dass ein 29jhriger Mann aus Bottrop kommt, wie viele Leute bleiben dann noch brig, um die konkrete Person zu ermitteln?

- Mit jedem weiteren Kriterium sinkt die Zahl  Rasterfahndung on-the-fly fr jedermann. Soziale Netzwerke wie Facebook wissen einfach unglaublich viel ber ihre Nutzer.

## Two critical bugs and more malicious apps make for a bad week for Android

- CVE 2016-3861, it allows attackers to execute malware or escalate local privileges on vulnerable phones.

- Brand warned that it's "an extremely serious bug" because it can be exploited in a large variety of ways

- "It would also be possible to make the exploit faster by directly generating the exploit files in javascript, reducing the unnecessary network round-trips [spent] retrieving identical mp4 files."

- Cataloged as CVE-2016-3862, it can be exploited by sending a maliciously formatted jpeg image. When sent through Gmail or Google Talk, the malicious code is concealed inside Exif data embedded in the image.

## Linode fends off multiple DDOS attacks

- Cloud hosting outfit Linode has again come under significant denial of service (DoS) attack. The attacks aren't as bad as the epic events that all-but-took Linode down in January 2016, but they are coming in thick and fast.  

- Some of the attacks lasted up to eight hours. Linode's engineers appear to have successfully fought off all of the attacks, but has often warned of degraded performance to APIs or sometimes to whole data centres. The weekend attacks struck three data locations: Singapore, Atlanta and Tokyo.

- The Tokyo DoS attack was over in ten minutes.

- The other incidents ran a little longer. Linode's logs suggest it noticed and mitigated the attacks within half an hour.

- So the company has clearly armed itself with tools that allow it to deflect DoS attacks quickly and effectively. It clearly needs that capacity: The Register counts ten attacks in September alone and the month is young.

## Stealing login credentials from a locked PC or Mac just got easier

- Snatching the login credentials of a locked computer just got easier and faster, thanks to a technique that requires only $50 worth of hardware and takes less than 30 seconds to carry out. Rob Fuller, a principal security engineer at R5 Industries, said the hack works reliably on Windows devices and has also succeeded on OS X, although he's working with others to determine if it's just his setup that's vulnerable.

- In the event the machine is running an older version of Windows, the returned NTLMv1 hash can be converted to NTLM format no matter how complex the underlying plaintext password is.

- The victim then makes route decisions and starts sending the traffic it was already creating to the Armory instead of the "real" network connection.

- Seeing that the database of Responder has been modified the Armory shuts down (LED goes solid). The demo underscores the age-old maxim equating physical access with owning or "pwning" a device.

- And for that reason, a hack that surreptitiously steals the passwords of such computers in 20 seconds is noteworthy. Mubix said he's working on a follow-up post suggesting ways to prevent the attack.

## Huawei Is Building A Successor To The Google Nexus 7, Says Report

- According to reliable product leaker Evan Blass, Google is working with Huawei to produce the successor to the wildly popular Google Nexus 7.

- Evan Blass tweeted yesterday: "Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year."

- Google is undergoing the Great Hardware Unification of 2016, and according to a report from Android Police, the Nexus line is going away to make way for a unified 'Pixel' line.

- We last saw a 7-inch Google tablet in 2013, when the Nexus 7 was released as a follow-up to the original 2012 version.

- Both of these were built by Asus and were well-received thanks to their novel (at the time) 7-inch, 16:9 form factor and low price (~$230)."

## Pixellation popped: AI can ID you, even after PhotoShop phuzzing

- Pixellating images turns out to be a dodgy way of obfuscating identities, say researchers from the University of Texas and Cornell Tech who reckon computers can be trained to identify the protected people. There's an "if" here, namely that pixellation can be popped if an "attacker has a set of clear shots to practice on.

- That mightn't sound like much  a human operator could achieve the same thing  but because it's computerised, it can be automated.

- And therefore done faster, at all hours of day or night. In a paper at Arxiv, Richard McPherson and his collaborators (Reza Shokri and Vitaly Shmatikov of Cornell Tech), say pixellation (mosaicing), blurring (as used in YouTube) and even encrypting JPEG coefficients (a scheme called P3, Privacy Protecting Photo sharing) can recover image thought protected. They believe they can train artificial neural networks to successfully identify faces and recognize objects and handwritten digits even if the images are protected using any of the above obfuscation techniques.

- We do not even need to understand what exactly is leaked by a partially encrypted or obfuscated image.

- Instead, neural networks automatically discover the relevant features and learn to exploit the correlations between hidden and visible information, they write. The only difficult part, in dealing with photos, is that the attacker would need to trawl social media for a set of possible faces that may appear in a given photo. The attack can also work for recovering text or handwriting that's been obfuscated, they reckon, as long as the attacker has access to a training dataset (which exist online as as benchmarks for image recognition models). The paper includes the neural network architectures used for training the boffins' models, and they note that this would be useful as a benchmark for developers working on better ways to protect privacy in images.

## Intel Breaks Qualcomm's Hold On Apple's Baseband Chips

- The selection of Intel chip means that in newer iPhones Apple will no longer support CDMA technology popularized by Qualcomm

- The Wall Street Journal states that many industry analysts believe Intel could be supplying as many as half of of baseband chips for Apple's handsets.

- In a big blow to Qualcomm, Apple plans to incorporate Intel baseband chips into at least some models of the new iPhone 7.

## Snagging creds from locked machines  Room362

- There is probably a more elegant way to do this, but because this computer is being plugged in and taken out pretty frequently, we could run into a max in leases but most likely the file will get corrupted at some point so we just remove and re-add it. Start Responder in a screen session.

- Now, I believe there are restrictions on what types of devices are allowed to install at a locked out state on newer operating systems (Win10/El Capitan), but Ethernet/LAN is definitely on the white list. Computers are constantly creating traffic, even if you dont have any browsers or applications open, and most computers trust their local network for some reason (I know the technical bits on why, just complaining...) Network preference when there are more than gateway or network connection is based on metrics on Windows and a combination of metrics and preference on OSX, but by default wired and newer/faster always win out. 

- When the LED goes solid white the Armory has fully shutdown because of the watch script, creds achieved!.

-  The Armory is more versitile with APT package to do more fun, definitely a great way to dev the attack.

- More storage (SD based) and slightly faster processor Hak5 LAN Turtle is MUCH easier to pass off when you are trying to plug in a device during an SE attack.

## Recovering an iPhone 5c Passcode

- Remember the San Bernardino killer's iPhone, and how the FBI maintained that they couldn't get the encryption key without Apple providing them with a universal backdoor?

- Abstract: This paper is a short summary of a real world mirroring attack on the Apple iPhone 5c passcode retry counter under iOS 9.

- This was achieved by desoldering the NAND Flash chip of a sample phone in order to physically access its connection to the SoC and partially reverse engineering its proprietary bus protocol.

- By using the described and successful hardware mirroring process it was possible to bypass the limit on passcode retry attempts.

- This is the first public demonstration of the working prototype and the real hardware mirroring process for iPhone 5c.

## Bitcoin Hardware Wallet Review: Ledger May Have Caught Up to Trezor With Nano S

- Added security measures, such as the ability to visually confirm the correct receiving address on the devices display, were always the key selling point of the Trezor, but Ledger may have now caught up to its rival with the Nano S.While the Nano S does include a screen for verifying the receiving address before sending a transaction, thats only part of the reason why it is a compelling alternative to the Trezor.

- Applications are isolated from each other and from the kernel, which means that, for example, a bug in the Ethereum app cannot compromise Bitcoin-derived keys.According to Bacca, the Secure Element also protects against interdiction attacks (when packages are intercepted en route by third parties like the NSA).

- Whether a nefarious actor listens to the behavior of the chip in an attempt to deduce information or physically targets specific aspects of the chip to derail running code, a Secure Element has added protections to limit the effectiveness of an attack.In a complex active attack  where an attacker tries, for example, to dump the memory by extracting it from the chip  a Secure Element protects against those by encrypting everything in place (flash, RAM, memory buses) and features a mesh that'll detect potential intrusions into the chip structure and erase its internal cryptographic keys when it happens, Bacca explained as an example defense mechanism.Bacca discussed these issues more deeply in a presentation early last year.In general, SatoshiLabs, which is the company behind the Trezor, disagrees with the security claims surrounding the use of a Secure Element.

- Ledgers Chrome extension was mainly praised for helping users avoid address reuse and allowing multiple accounts to be created and managed.As a comparison, the myTrezor.com web wallet scored a 42 out of 100 in the OBPP report.

- We'll add BIP 39 passphrase support in a future update, mostly for privacy or plausible deniability reasons  it'll be possible to enter it directly on device or to link it to a specific PIN to work with all services that might not be aware of it, he said.Ledger also has a new hardware wallet in the works known as the Ledger Blue, which supports a variety of new features such as Bluetooth connectivity and a touchscreen display.

- In other words: Chrome now explicitly tells users non-HTTPS sites aren't private.

- If a Chrome user visits a site that isn't private -- for example, there's no HTTPS, broken HTTPS, or HTTPS only on 'checkout' pages -- Chrome now displays a mid-grey colored info box.

- Translation: Our proprietary, impossible-to-audit, running nobody-knows-what firmware microcontroller (uC) has full authority over the boot process and execution of any system and apps running on our ORWL computer.

- Translation: All the user data can be recovered by whoever has/finds a way to retrieve the key from our impossible-to-audit, impossible-to-verify uC.

- Translation: At some point in time, we will make select portions of the firmware (i.e. these portions we have authored, such as maybe the logo-displaying code) available... to select partners... using yet-to-be-determined licenses.

- Translation: The datasheet for the secure uC might never be released.

## Smartphones Can Steal 3D Printing Plans By Listening To The Printer

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from FedScoop: Smartphones equipped with special programming can become a sophisticated spy sensor capable of stealing designs from a 3D printer -- just by measuring the noise and electromagnetic radiation the printer emits.

- Researchers from the University of Buffalo recently discovered how a smartphone on a bench about 8 inches away from a 3D printer could allow someone to reconstruct a simple object being printed with 94 percent accuracy.

- The attack basically reverse-engineers the printing blueprint by reconstructing the movement of the nozzle from the electromagnetic and acoustic energy it generates while working.

- Most information came from electromagnetic waves, which accounted for about 80 percent of the useful data.

-  Wenyao Xu, assistant professor in the University of Buffalo's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, is the lead author of the study, "My Smartphone Knows What You Print: Exploring Smartphone-Based Side-Channel Attacks Against 3D Printers," which will be presented at the Association for Computing Machinery's 23rd annual Conference on Computer and Communications Security next month in Austria.

- Beats brings in more revenue from Bluetooth headphones than LG, Bose, or Jaybird, according to NPD figures released in July.

- In terms of unit sales, it controls over a quarter of the Bluetooth headphone market.

- And Apple's removal of the headphone jack is likely to give them another boost.

## Project Zero: Return to libstagefright: exploiting libutils on Android

- The technique I originally considered to do this was implemented already by NorthBit, using the metadata returned to the browser to construct an information leak; this seems to be the simplest way.

- Another possibility would be to corrupt the objects used for communication with the remote HTTP server; the mediaserver process makes HTTP requests to retrieve the media file, and we could perhaps modify the headers to leak information; but I did not follow this route.   I looked at using the metadata corruption technique they implemented, but it seemed somewhat impractical to me.

- When more track information is parsed and stored in the MetaData object, the KeyedVector backing the MetaData will expect that it needs to resize the backing storage; and will request the SharedBuffer to allocate more data; the SharedBuffer will think it has plenty of space and just carry on.   So, as we know, we can only practically use this to leak things which are aligned in the last column of our hexdump; and this is not normally where wed expect to find a vtable pointer; so we have to investigate the layout of all the objects we can create in the hope that we can find one that will place a useful pointer at an offset we can leak.

- Its no major stress from here to getting ROP execution in the mediaserver process using the same technique as my previous exploit; and from there to shellcode on Android M is simply a case of calling mprotect; which is even imported by libmedia.so.

- However, every time I tested, attempts to lookup the system_server services failed - and looking in the logs I realised that Id misunderstood the selinux policy.

## Cryptpad: a free/open, end-to-end encrypted, zero-knowledge shared text editor

-  Tools like Etherpad and Google Docs are transformative ways to collaborate on text (including code); I've used them in contexts as varied as making unofficial transcripts of statements at UN agencies to liveblogging conference presentations -- but they all share a weakness, which is that whomever owns the document server can see everything you're typing.

-   CryptPad uses a variant of the Operational transformation algorithm which is able to find distributed consensus using a Nakamoto Blockchain, a construct popularized by Bitcoin.

- and on the website, master propmaker Shawn Thorsson shares an elaborate and fearsome set of instructions for making your own gigantic, embossed battle-axe. READ THE REST

- With your subscription, you get access to 13 professionally designed WordPress themes, over 80 [...] READ THE REST

- What started as a simple idea to try out the subscription model on pet owners has since developed a cult following of dog lovers.

## 40 Percent of Organizations Store Admin Passwords In Word Documents, Says Survey

- While the IT industry is making progress in securing information and communications systems from cyberattacks, a new survey from cybersecurity company CyberArk says several critical areas, such as privileged account security,  third-party vendor access and cloud platforms are undermining them.

- An anonymous Slashdot reader shares with us the details of the report via eSecurity Planet: According to the results of a recent survey of 750 IT security decision makers worldwide, 40 percent of organizations store privileged and administrative passwords in a Word document or spreadsheet, while 28 percent use a shared server or USB stick.

- Still, the survey, sponsored by CyberArk and conducted by Vanson Bourne, also found that 55 percent of respondents said they have evolved processes for managing privileged accounts.

- Fully 79 percent of respondents said they have learned lessons from major cyberattacks and have taken appropriate action to improve security.

- Sixty-eight percent of organizations cite losing customer data as one of their biggest concerns following a cyberattack, and 57 percent of organizations that store information in the cloud are not completely confident in their cloud provider's ability to protect their data.

## People are actually drilling holes in their iPhone 7s to make a socket

- Last week YouTuber TechRax uploaded a video in which he outlined a secret hack to get a headphone jack in the iPhone 7.

- In the video, he uses a drill to forcibly create a hole in his smartphone which, as youd imagine, doesnt actually work as a headphone jack.

- Unfortunately, that joke has flown over the heads of many, and TechRax has therefore been unwittingly responsible for a number of people actually drilling holes into their iPhone 7 handsets.

- Stop the planet, I want to get off.The YouTube video has amassed over 7.5 million views since being posted online last week, with it attracting 81,000 dislikes in the process.

- The comments section is currently torn between people who are in on the joke, people who criticize TechRax for damaging his iPhone 7 (a recurring complaint is that children are starving in Africa while TechRax ruins an expensive piece of technology, but these children couldnt eat an iPhone so Im not entirely sure what the comparison is there), and most unfortunately, people who have tried the hack out for themselves.Although this is YouTube so you can never be quite sure of whether or not these folks are trolling, parsing the comments section reveals some pretty convincing complaints lobbed in TechRaxs direction.

## 150,000 IoT Devices Behind the 1Tbps DDoS Attack on OVH

-     The hosting provider OVH continues to face massive DDoS attacks launched by a botnet composed at least of 150000 IoT devices.  Last week, the hosting provider OVH faced 1Tbps DDoS attack, likely the largest one ever seen. The OVH founder and CTO Octave Klaba reported the 1Tbps DDoS attack on Twitter sharing an image that lists the multiple sources of the attack. Last days, we got lot of huge DDoS.

- You can see the simultaneous DDoS are close to 1Tbps ! said Klaba. Klaba explained that the servers of its company were hit by multiple attacks exceeding 100 Gbps simultaneously concurring at 1 Tbps DDoS attack.

- One of the attacks documented by the OVH reached 93 MMps and 799 Gbps.     Klaba speculated the attackers used an IoT botnet composed also of compromised CCTV cameras.

- Now we have more information on the   Now Klaba added further information on the powerful DDoS attacks, the CTO of the OVH claimed that the botnet used by attackers is powered by more than 150,000 Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including cameras and DVRs. The overall botnet is capable of launching attacks that exceed 1.5 Tbps.  This botnet with 145607 cameras/dvr (1-30Mbps per IP) is able to send 1.5Tbps DDoS.

- The bad news for the OVH company is that attacks are still ongoing and the size of the botnet is increasing. +6857 new cameras participated in the DDoS last 48H. added Klaba. The company was targeted by various types of traffic, including Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) traffic, a novelty in the DDoS landscape.  Unfortunately, such kind of DDoS attacks will be even more frequent, it is too easy for hackers gain control of poorly configured, or vulnerable, IoT devices.  Last week experts observed another massive DDoS that targeted the website of the popular cyber security expert Brian Krebs.

## Android Stagefright MP4 tx3g Integer Overflow

- While a wide variety of remote attack vectors exist, this particular exploit is designed to work within an HTML5 compliant browser.

- As a result, a temporary buffer is allocated with insufficient size and a memcpy call leads to a heap overflow.

- First, we use a variant of their technique to read the address of a heap buffer located adjacent to a SampleIterator object as the video HTML element's videoHeight.

- NOTE: the mediaserver process on many Android devices (Nexus, for example) is constrained by SELinux and thus cannot use the execve system call.

- Next, we read the vtable pointer from an empty Vector within        the SampleIterator object using the video element's duration.

## 19-Year-Old Jailbreaks iPhone 7 In 24 Hours

- An anonymous reader writes: 19-year-old hacker qwertyoruiop, aka Luca Todesco, jailbroke the new iPhone 7 just 24 hours after he got it, in what's the first known iPhone 7 jailbreak. Todesco tweeted a screenshot of a terminal where he has "root," alongside the message: "This is a jailbroken iPhone 7."

- He even has video proof of the jailbreak.

- Motherboard reports: "He also said that he could definitely submit the vulnerabilities he found to Apple, since they fall under the newly launched bug bounty, but he hasn't decided whether to do that yet.

- The hacker told me that he needs to polish the exploits a bit more to make the jailbreak 'smoother,' and that he is also planning to make this jailbreak work through the Safari browser just like the famous 'jailbreakme.com,' which allowed anyone to jailbreak their iPhone 4 just by clicking on a link."

- Apple responded to the news by saying, "Apple strongly cautions against installing any software that hacks iOS.

## Google rushes in where Akamai fears to tread, shields Krebs after world's-worst DDoS

- 

- Google has provided free distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) mitigation services to security publication Krebs on Security, stepping in after Akamai withdrew support. The information security site was last week hammered with a 620Gbps DDoS attack, widely rated one of the world's largest by volume of junk data.  

- Mitigation platform Akamai soaked up the attack traffic under pro bono protection it offered Krebs until it cut the site loose claiming it could no longer shield the site without impacting paying customers. Krebs went offline to shield his hosting provider and returned today under Google's free DDoS attack mitigation service Project Shield.

- Google provides the shield to verified journalists and non-profit organisations. Krebs on Security focuses on information-security-related crime and is known for revealing the suspected identities of those behind attacks. As a result it has sparked the ire of many online criminals who launch regular DDoS attacks against the site, and often mock Krebs on Security journalist Brian Krebs in crime forums. The site recently exposed vDOS a DDoS attack service, known as a booter, which provided what it called stress testing services to customers. Booters are sold as legitimate tools for admins to test their own network resilience against DDoS, but are more often than not used in illegal DDoS attacks against various sites.

- The service saw its alleged operators arrested in an FBI sting.

## Patch AGAIN: OpenSSL security fixes now need their own security fixes

- 

- Sysadmins and devs, fresh from a weekend spoiled by last week's OpenSSL emergency patch, have another emergency patch to install. One of last week's fixes, for CVE-2016-6307, created CVE-2016-6309, a dangling pointer security vulnerability.  

-  

- As the fresh advisory states: The patch applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where if a message larger than approx 16k is received, then the underlying buffer to store the incoming message is reallocated and moved. Unfortunately a dangling pointer to the old location is left, which results in an attempt to write to the previously freed location.

- This is likely to result in a crash, however it could potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code. OpenSSL 1.1.0 users need to install 1.1.0b. That one, rated critical, was turned up by Robert Swiecki of the Google Security Team. In the other bug (CVE-2016-7052), OpenSSL 1.0.2i omitted a certificate revocation list (CRL) sanity check from 1.1.0, meaning any attempt to use CRLs in OpenSSL 1.0.2i will crash with a null pointer exception. Grab OpenSSL 1.0.2j to fix that one. The latest patched code is available here or from your favorite operating system distribution.

## Microsoft launches fuzzing-as-a-service to help developers find security bugs

- At Microsoft's Ignite conference in Atlanta yesterday, the company announced the availability of a new cloud-based service for developers that will allow them to test application binaries for security flaws before they're deployed.

- Called Project Springfield, the service uses "whitebox fuzzing" (also known as "smart fuzzing") to test for common software bugs used by attackers to exploit systems. In standard fuzzing tests, randomized inputs are thrown at software in an effort to find something that breaks the codea buffer overflow that would let malicious code be planted in the system's memory or an unhandled exception that causes the software to crash or processes to hang.

- Another approach, called static code analysis (or "whiteboxing"), looks instead at the source code and walks through it without executing it, using ranges of inputs to determine whether security flaws may be present. Whitebox fuzzing combines some of the aspects of each of these approaches.

- Using machine learning techniques, the system repeatedly runs the code through fuzzing sessions, adapting its approach based on what it discovers with each pass.

- The approach is similar to some of the techniques developed by competitors in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Cyber Grand Challenge to allow for automated bug detection and patching. Microsoft Research scientist Patrice Godefroid led the development of Microsoft's internal whitebox fuzzing tool, called SAGE, which is the basis for the new service.

## OpenSSL swats a dozen bugs, one notable nasty

- 

- A dozen flaws have been patched in OpenSSL, including one high severity hole that allows denial of service attacks. The OpenSSL Project pushed patches in versions 1.1.0a, 1.0.2i and 1.0.1u, with most of the flaws flagged as low severity risks.  

-  

- The nastiest vulnerability (CVE-2016-6304) results when attackers issue a massive OCSP status request extension which exhausts memory on servers in default configuration.

- Researcher Shi Lei of vulnerability blitzkrieg house Qihoo 360 spotted that one. Admins can mitigate damage by running no-ocsp or by running older versions of OpenSSL below 1.0.1g. Another moderate severity denial of service flaw (CVE-2016-6305) is fixed in the patch run which affects 1.0 of OpenSSL. The OpenSSL project nixed risky ciphers in version 1.1 to squash the so-called Sweet32 exploit which is a birthday attack against 64-bit ciphers like Blowfish and Triple DES. Cisco said it was difficult to exploit. For a successful attack, a large amount of data has to be sent one-way during the session, and the session has to be encrypted using the same key," Borg security engineers said. "For 64-bit ciphers, it would take about 32GB of data in order to have a 50 percent probability of collision in any of the cipher blocks.

## Mozilla wants woeful WoSign certs off the list

- Mozilla wants to kick Chinese certificate authority (CA) WoSign out of its trust program. As well as being worried about the certs issued by WoSign, Mozilla accuses the company of buying another CA, StartCom, without telling anyone.  

- In this lengthy analysis posted to Google Docs, Mozilla says its certificate wonks have "... lost confidence in the ability of WoSign/StartCom to faithfully and competently discharge the functions of a CA.

- " That investigation follows on from a huge number of issues Mozilla outlines here. Those issues include WoSign's notorious error of issuing a cert for GitHub to a university student. The Mozilla engineers' report revolves around SHA-1 certificates.

- SHA-1 has been regarded as insecure for years and is therefore being deprecated by all major browsers. As part of its deprecation process, Mozilla treats new SHA-1 certs as invalid unless the issuing CA completes an approval process  and the report says both WoSign and StartCom fudged the process by backdating new SHA-1s to make it seem they were issued before the January 1, 2016 ban. It accuses WoSign of acquiring Israeli StartCom without disclosing the change of ownership, which which we believe violates section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. Although its media release says StartCom remains independent of WoSign, Mozilla says the former is using the latter's infrastructure to issue certs. As an example of the backdating, Mozilla's investigation documents certificates issued to Australian payments processor Tyro.

- It nominates a StartCom SHA-1 certificate logged into Google's Certificate Transparency project in June this year, but which Mozilla believes was backdated by StartCom. The Register has tried to contact Tyro about this certificate. There's also a smackdown for WoSign's auditors, the Hong Kong office of Ernst  Young, which is says failed to detect multiple issues they should have detected. Mozilla says it wants to distrust only newly-issued certificates to try and reduce the impact on web users, as both of these CA brands have substantial outstanding certificate corpuses. Mozilla is seeking public comment on the issue, in particular to help decide when to implement its proposed ban, and whether WoSign or StartCom need to create new roots before they re-apply to be trusted again. Interestingly, WoSign issued a media release in China (you'll need Google Translate for this link) at the beginning of last week, announcing it completed its equity investment in StartCom on September 19.

## Sad reality: It's cheaper to get hacked than build strong IT defenses

- Romanosky analyzed 12,000 incident reports and found that typically they only account for 0.4 per cent of a company's annual revenues.

- That compares to billing fraud, which averages at 5 per cent, or retail shrinkage (ie, shoplifting and insider theft), which accounts for 1.3 per cent of revenues.

- As for reputational damage, Romanosky found that it was almost impossible to quantify

- He also noted that the effects of a data incident typically don't have many ramifications on the stock price of a company in the long term

- Under the circumstances, it doesn't make a lot of sense to invest too much in cyber security.

## Introducing Docker for Windows Server 2016

-  Today, Microsoft is announcing general availability of Windows Server 2016 at the Ignite conference in Atlanta.

- With Docker Engine and containers now available natively on Windows, developers and IT-pros can begin the same transformation for Windows-based apps and infrastructure and start reaping the same benefits: better security, more agility, and improved portability and freedom to move on-prem apps to the cloud. For developers and IT-pros that build and maintain heterogenous deployments with both Linux and Windows infrastructure, Docker on Windows holds even greater significance: The Docker platform now represents a single set of tools, APIs and image formats for managing both Linux and Windows apps.

- They can even write to their respective filesystems and registries without affecting each other. With containerization, Windows IT-pros get most of the isolation and release-artifact-stability benefits of VMs, without the resource overhead and lost agility inherent in hardware virtualization. Similar to how containers on Linux can run with different security profiles, containers on Windows run in one of two isolation modes:  Windows Server Containers use the same shared-kernel process-isolation paradigm known from Linux.

- Isolation mode does give IT-pros options when choosing how to deploy containerized apps in production. Also note that, while Hyper-V is the runtime technology powering hyper-v isolation, hyper-v isolated containers are not Hyper-V VMs and cannot be managed with classic Hyper-V tools. For readers interested in details of how containers are implemented on Windows, John Starks black belt session at DockerCon 16 is a great introduction.  Building Windows Container Images Thanks to layering improvements to the Windows Registry and filesystem, docker build and Dockerfiles are fully supported for creating Windows Docker images.

- Below is an example Windows Dockerfile that Stefan Scherer has proposed for the Node.js official Docker library image.

## Docker Announces Commercial Partnership with Microsoft

-  With industry analysts declaring Windows Server with more than 60% of the x86 server market, and citing Microsoft Azure as the fastest-growing public cloud, it comes as no surprise that Microsoft, even at its current scale, is further extending its leadership as a strategic, trusted partner to enterprise IT. It is this industry leadership that catalyzed our technical collaboration in the Docker open source project back in October 2014, to jointly bring the agility, portability, and security benefits of the Docker platform to Windows Server.

- After two years of joint engineering, we are excited to unveil a new, commercial partnership to extend these benefits for both Windows developers targeting Windows Server and enterprise IT professionals. Specifically, the commercial partnership entails:  The Commercially Supported Docker Engine aka CS Docker Engine, Docker, Inc.s tested, validated, and supported package of Docker Engine, will be available to Windows Server 2016 customers at no additional cost Microsoft will provide Windows Server 2016 customers enterprise support for CS Docker Engine, backed by Docker, Inc Docker and Microsoft will jointly promote Docker Datacenter to enable IT Pros to secure the Windows Server software supply chain and manage containerized Windows Server workloads, whether on-prem, in the cloud, or hybrid.  These fruits of this partnership for the first time offer enterprise IT professionals a single platform for both Windows and Linux applications on any infrastructure, whether bare metal, virtualized, or cloud.  CS Docker Engine and Docker Datacenter for Windows Server represent a major addition that complements several other joint initiatives as depicted above.   For developers, the integration of Visual Studio Tools for Docker and Docker for Windows provides complete desktop development environments for building Dockerized Windows apps; To jumpstart app development, Microsoft has contributed Windows Server container base images and apps to Docker Hub; For IT pros, Docker Datacenter will be designed to manage Windows Server environments in addition to the Linux environments Datacenter already manages.  Availability Windows Server 2016 will be generally available in October, when Windows Server 2016 customers will be able to download the first version of the CS Docker Engine.

- Docker Datacenter for managing Windows Server containerized workloads will be available shortly thereafter.

- While the announcements today represent another significant milestone in our partnership, Docker and Microsoft are just getting started. Check out the below to learn more!

## decoder-search.py Beta

-  Ive been developing a new Python program similar to XORSearch.

- decoder-search.py does brute-forcing and searching of a file like XORSearch, but it stead of simple operations like XOR, ROL, ..., it can handle more complex translations.

- Templates for these translations have to be provided in a configuration file, for example like this: expression ((byte + %i1:1-10%) ^ %i2:1-32%) % 0x100 This template specifies a translation expression that adds a number to each byte in the file, and then XORs the sum.

- Such an encoding has been used in the last hancitor maldoc samples. Here is the result on a sample that contains an encoded EXE:  And here is the result on a sample that contains encoded URLs:  For me this tool is still in beta phase, because I might change the format of the configuration file in later versions, without providing backwards compatibility.

- You can find it in my GitHub Beta repository.

## New Part Day: Wireless BeagleBones On A Chip

-  The BeagleBone is a very popular single board computer, best applied to real-time applications where you need to blink LEDs really, really fast.

- Over the years, the BeagleBone has been used for stand-alone CNC controllers, the brains behind very large LED installations, and on rare occasions has been used to drive CRTs.

- RAM is set at 512MB, with 4GB of eMMC Flash and Debian pre-installed, and a microSD card for larger storage options.

- But when you get to the gigantic brick of resin dropped squarely in the middle of the board does the latest device in the BeagleBone family become very, very interesting.

- Its still a bit beyond the standard capabilities of OSHPark, but the design can still be cut down, and shows how this BeagleBone on a Chip can be applied to other Open Hardware projects.

## Security things in Linux v4.3

- Since there wasnt a lot of time to talk about them all, I figured Id make some short blog posts here about the stuff I was paying attention to, along with links to more information.

- Additionally, not everything I think worth mentioning here technically falls under the kernel self-protection ideal anyway  some things are just really interesting userspace-facing features. So, to that end, here are things I found interesting in v4.3: CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN Russell King implemented this feature for ARM which provides emulated segregation of user-space memory when running in kernel mode, by using the ARM Domain access control feature.

- Instead, an attacker must find areas in kernel memory that are writable (and in the case of code, executable), where they can discover the location as well.

- And as we continue to reduce the attack surface of the kernel, these opportunities will continue to shrink. While hardware support for this kind of segregation exists in s390 (natively separate memory spaces), ARM (PXN and PAN as mentioned above), and very recent x86 (SMEP since Ivy-Bridge, SMAP since Skylake), ARM is the first upstream architecture to provide this emulation for existing hardware.

- By being able to explicitly pass capabilities at runtime (instead of based on filesystem markings), this becomes much easier. For more details, the commit message is well-written, almost twice as long as than the code changes, and contains a test case.

## Guy Sims Fitch, a Fake Writer Invented by the US Government

- Theyve asked that I submit verification of identity for the editors and journalists who wrote under the name Guy Sims Fitch in the 1950s and 60s, along with documents showing that those people consent to having their information made public.

- In fact, the CIA had to acknowledge during 1977 congressional hearings that the disinformation they were helping to get published through a variety of media around the world would often find its way into American news outlets.

- We are not insulated from the rest of the world and its problems and dangers.It is good news that increased private investment overseas is being urged by American business groups as a means of replaceing aid with trade.

- Specific examples of the activities urged would be putting glass and nails on the highways, leaving water running in public buildings, putting sand in machinery, wasting electricity, taking sick leave from work, damaging sugar stalks during the harvest, etc.If real results were achieved, the Voice of America [radio network] could report these as evidence of opposition to the Castro regime through interviews with refugees and extracts from letters, Murrows memo continued.But we dont know if Murrow himself ever wrote under the name of Guy Sims Fitch.

- And in the case of Guy Sims Fitch, figuring out why the USIA was writing editorials all around the world in at least half a dozen languages to promote US investments seems like it would be valuable to our understanding of Cold War history.

## Cops blasted for relying on IP addresses to hunt down suspects

- A new white paper from the Electronic Frontier Foundation argues that police rely too heavily on IP addresses when conducting criminal investigations. The paper [PDF], written by EFF executive director Cindy Cohn along with legal fellow Aaron Mackey and senior staff technologist Seth Schoen, argues that the numerical addresses are neither accurate nor specific enough to serve as the grounds for police to conduct searches of suspected criminals.  

- Yet as law enforcement increasingly relies on electronic evidence to investigate crimes, one of the most readily available tools, Internet Protocol addresses (IP addresses), have become increasingly misused and misunderstood by law enforcement and judges alike," the authors argue. "Law enforcement too often overstates the reliability of IP address information in seeking warrants and other process (such as subpoenas), using metaphors that create a sense of certainty where it does not always exist.

- " Citing cases where individuals had been wrongly searched or arrested for crimes that were traced back to their IP address, the EFF noted that IP addresses become limited when trying to trace the activity of a specific user and machine. The white paper notes that when users share their connection via an open WiFi network or run a Tor exit node, their IP addresses can be identified as the source of the illegal activity without specifying who precisely is committing the crime. "EFF recognizes that many police already treat IP addresses as the starting point in their investigations and do more work before seeking a warrant.

- But for others in law enforcement, this is not always the case," the white paper notes. "Police must therefore understand that IP addresses alone are not always reliable enough to pinpoint an exact location or individual because the technology was never built for those functions.

- In such cases, the paper argues, police would use the IP address as a starting point and then seek additional evidence. "As with informants, the IP address information that police provide in warrant applications requires explaining the context and corroboration, including: where the address information was obtained, how that was mapped to a physical location or a person, and whether there are other facts that bear on its reliability, such as the listing of the IP address on a Tor server list," the authors argue. "Thus, these cases can provide a guide for police, prosecutors and courts in thinking about how to scrutinize IP address information contained in warrant applications."

## Report: NSA hushed up zero-day spyware tool losses for three years

- Sources close to the investigation into how NSA surveillance tools and zero-day exploits ended up in the hands of hackers has found that the agency knew about the loss for three years but didnt want anyone to know. Multiple sources told Reuters last night that the investigation into the data dump released by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers had determined that the NSA itself wasn't directly hacked and the software didn't come from exiled whistleblower Edward Snowden.

- It appears at this stage that the staffer, who has since left the NSA for other reasons, stashed the sensitive tools on an outside server  likely a bounce box  after an operation.

- It monitored the world's internet traffic to try and catch sight of the tools or someone using the software or the holes it exploited.

- Since no signs appeared the agency didnt tell anyone of the loss. According to US government guidelines the NSA is supposed to assess the seriousness of zero-day flaws it finds and inform companies if it feels they are serious enough.

- Documents obtained by the EFF stated that the NSA told manufacturers about 91 per cent of the flaws it found. That didn't happen, and a lot of security people are going to be asking why not.

## OWASP OWTF  Offensive Web Testing Framework

-  OWASP Offensive Web Testing Framework is a project focused on penetration testing efficiency and alignment of security tests to security standards like: The OWASP Testing Guide (v3 and v4), the OWASP Top 10, PTES and NIST.  The purpose of this tool is to automate the manual and uncreative parts of pen testing.

- For example, Figuring out how to call tool X then parsing results of tool X manually to feed tool Y and so on is time consuming. By reducing this burden we hope pen testers will have more time to:  See the big picture and think out of the box, Find, verify and combine vulnerabilities efficiently, Have time to Investigate complex vulnerabilities like business logic, architectural flaws, virtual hosting sessions, etc. Perform more tactical/targeted fuzzing on seemingly risky areas Demonstrate true impact despite the short time-frames we are typically given to test.  

-  This tool is however not a silver bullet and will only be as good as the person using it.

- Understanding and experience will be required to correctly interpret the tool output and decide what to investigate further in order to demonstrate the impact. Features  Web UI.

- Now configure and monitor OWTF via a responsive and powerful interface accessible via your browser. Exposes RESTful APIs to all core OWTF capabilties. Instead of implementing yet another spider (a hard job), OWTF will scrub the output of all tools/plugins run to gather as many URLs as possible. Scan by various aggression levels: OWTF supports scans which are based on the aggressiveness of the plugins/tools invoked. Extensible OWTF manages tools through plugins making it trivial to add new tools. OWTF has been developed keeping Kali Linux in mind, but it also supports other pentesting distros such as Samurai-WTF, etc. Tool paths and configuration can be easily modified in the web interface. Fastest Python MiTM proxy yet! Crash reporting directly to Github issue tracker Comprehensive interactive report at end of each scan Easy plugin-based system; currently 100+ plugins! CLI and web interface  You can download OWASP OWTF here:

## Yup, now the iPhone 7 is exploding

- While the company has certainly improved its image over the past few years, Samsung is likely most famous for being an Apple copycat.

- So whats the latest feature Apple ripped off from its top smartphone rival Samsung?

- Apparently, Apple was jealous that Samsungs exploding Galaxy Note 7 is stealing some of the iPhone 7s airtime, so it built an exploding smartphone of its own. All joking aside  and before other sites catch wind of this story and go crazy with it  this clearly appears to be an isolated incident, at least for the time being. The image above was posted by Reddit user kroopthesnoop on Wednesday, and it shows a matte black iPhone 7 Plus that certainly looks like it exploded.

- Unlike Samsungs somewhat widespread Galaxy Note 7 problem that was due to a battery defect, however, this iPhone exploded while in transit, according to the phones owner.

- When he received the iPhone he ordered and took it out of the box, this is what he found. Details are scarce for the time being.

## Verizon Technician Is Accused of Selling Customers' Call Records and Location Data To Private Investigator

- The Associated Press reports:  [Daniel Eugene Traeger] logged into one Verizon computer system to gain access to customers' call records, authorities said.

- He used another company system known as Real Time Tool to "ping" cellphones on Verizon's network to get locations of the devices, according to the plea agreement.

- "Between April 2009 and January 2014, the defendant was paid more than $10,000 in exchange for his provision of confidential customer information and cellular location data to the PL, an unauthorized third party," court records state.

- Though Traeger was based in the Birmingham area, the court records do not indicate whether the information that was sold involved Verizon Wireless customers in Alabama or elsewhere.

- He faces up to five years in prison, but prosecutors are recommending a lesser sentence since he accepted responsibility, according to terms of the plea agreement.

## D-Wave's 2,000-Qubit Quantum Annealing Computer Now 1,000x Faster Than Previous Generation

- This is because qubits can hold a value of 0, 1, or a superposition of the two, making quantum systems able to deal with much more complex information.

- The new generation also comes with control features, which allows users to modify how D-Wave's quantum system works to better optimize their solutions.

- These control features include the following capabilities: The ability to tune the rate of annealing of individual qubits to enhance application performance; The ability to sample the state of the quantum computer during the quantum annealing process to power hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms that were not previously possible; The ability to combine quantum processing with classical processing to improve the quality of both optimization and sampling results returned from the system.

- The company is also training the first generation of programmers to develop applications for D-Wave quantum systems. Last year, Google said that D-Wave's 1,000 qubit computer proved to be 100 million times faster than a classical computer with a single core: "We found that for problem instances involving nearly 1,000 binary variables, quantum annealing significantly outperforms its classical counterpart, simulated annealing.

- It is more than 10^8 times faster than simulated annealing running on a single core," said Hartmut Neven, Google's Director of Engineering.

## Crypto guru Matt Green asks courts for DMCA force field so he can safely write a textbook

- Assistant Professor Matthew Green has asked US courts for protection so that he can write a textbook explaining cryptography without getting sued under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Green, who teaches at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, is penning a tome called Practical Cryptographic Engineering that examines the cryptographic mechanisms behind the devices we use every day, such as ATM machines, smart cars, and medical devices.

- Section 1201 prohibits the circumvention of copyright protection systems installed by manufacturers, and comes with penalties including heavy fines and possible jail time.

- They are possibly right, but thats not the point of this lawsuit  the real goal is the destruction of the DMCA. As Cory Doctorow explained at last years DEF CON, supporters of the DMCA are smart about what cases they choose to prosecute.

- Doctorow opined that the case went ahead because the entertainment companies knew it would be a slam dunk  the magazine had limited funds and the court would be protested by ugly-looking hackers. By contrast, the Recording Industry Association of America backed down in its lawsuit against Princeton professor Edward Felten over his cracking of the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a watermarking system for CDs.

- Felten was due to present a paper on the technology and was promptly sued, but the RIAA dropped its case, in part due to worries that a jury wouldnt stomach censoring an academic. So the EFF has decided to support two actions against the DMCA: Green and the case of researcher Andrew Huang, who wants to make an open-source computer that would allow commercial videos to be edited.

## Vue 2.0 is here

- The official guide has been fully updated and is available at vuejs.org/guide.Ever since the work on 2.0 started back in April, the core team has made significant contributions to API design, bug fixes, documentation and TypeScript typings (yes, vue core, vue-router and vuex 2.0 all have TypeScript typings shipped in the npm packages), and the community also provided extremely valuable feedback on API changes  a big thank you to everyone involved!Whats New in 2.0PerformanceBased on 3rd party benchmark, lower is betterThe rendering layer has been rewritten using a light-weight Virtual DOM implementation forked from snabbdom.

- The new rendering layer provides significant performance improvements compared to v1, and makes Vue 2.0 one of the fastest frameworks out there.

- In addition, it requires minimal effort in terms of optimization because Vues reactivity system is able to precisely determine components that need to be re-rendered in a large and complex component tree.Its also worth mentioning that the 2.0 runtime-only build weighs at only 16kb min+gzipped, and totals at 26kb even with vue-router and vuex included, on par with the v1 core alone!Render FunctionsDespite the rendering layer overhaul, Vue 2.0 maintains a largely 1.0 compatible template syntax with only minor deprecations.

- The tool is not able to catch every deprecation, but it will help you get a good head start for sure.One More Thing...The engineers at Alibaba, the biggest e-commerce company in China, have been working on a project called Weex, which renders components written in a Vue-inspired syntax into native mobile UI.

- But soon, Vue-inspired will become Vue-powered  we have started an official collaboration to make Vue 2.0 the actual JavaScript runtime framework for Weex.

## Fake Cellphone Emergency Alerts About Zombies and Nuclear Attacks Predicted

- "No matter how solid the system is, history reveals that false alarms -- of zombies, nuclear attacks, missing children -- are inevitable," warns an essay at Medium.

- An anonymous Slashdot reader summarizes the article: New York's police department is hailing emergency alerts as "the future" of government communications to citizens.

- But could the same system be used by scammers directing millions of people to a malware-installing site, or "a terrorist intent on causing mass panic (i.e., 'Tsunami imminent, evacuate immediately')...

- The article runs through great moments in the history of false alerts -- including a 1971 incident where the national warning system mistakenly sent out the pre-nuclear attack warning, "normal broadcasting will cease immediately," and warnings in 2013 about zombie attacks in Montana, New Mexico, and Michigan.

- "To tell anybody that an agency is immune to these attacks would be a grave injustice," said the IT overseer at Iowa's Department of Public Safety.

## Wells Fargo started demanding fraud of its employees in 1998; Illinois cuts Wells off from state business

-  Now, an investigative report from Public Citizen examined the bank's own investor releases and found that the crazy sales-quotas (8 "financial products" per customer") and insane pressure to meet them (daily, per-employee reports on the number of financial products sold to Wells customers) began no later than 1998, meaning that the bank's internal fraud investigation should stretch back, at a minimum, 18 years.

-  Despite the wrist-slap the bank got from its regulator for opening 2,000,000 fake accounts in its customers' names, things are not going well for the firm.

- Connecticut hasn't gone that far, but it did take Wells out of the running for a major bond issue and gave the business to Morgan Stanley.

-  Alaska and Oregon remain committed to giving Wells the people's money to handle, but it's hard to imagine that position holding for much longer.

- With 40mm drivers, powerful circuitry, and memory foam padded circumaural ear cups, these are clearly super high-quality headphones.

## 90 Cents of Every 'Pay-For-Performance' Dollar for CEOs Are Paid for Luck

- Related research from the Program on Corporate Governance includes Paying for Long-Term Performance by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried (discussed on the Forum here). 						It is well-known that CEOs are sometimes rewarded for luck.

- This result is robust, and stems from the fundamental fact that chance plays a dominant role in determining firm performance. The large pay-for-luck component implies that, perhaps in contrary to widespread belief, standard option-based compensation does not constitute a strong motivational force for the manager.

- We show that for standard non-indexed at-the-money options and realistic parameters the increase is only about 12% relative to the case of exerting no effort.

- It seems likely that other factors, such as ego, self-fulfillment, and the desire not to be perceived as lazy, are likely much more effective motivating forces.

- It is thus hard to justify the current norm of granting options at-the-money and not indexing them to the industry or market returns. The full paper is available for download here.

## "Why do you work in security instead of something more lasting ?"

-  This post grew out of a friend on Facebook asking (I paraphrase) "why do you spend your time on security instead of using your brainpower for something more lasting ?".

- Now, the 2 dozen is bullshit, but what is true that in all the noise  hype, I have met a number of very fun, unconventional, and deeply insightful thinkers of very different backgrounds.

- Many exploits require considerable inventiveness, and non-obvious / creative ways of solving problems; they are sometimes like a good joke / magic trick: With an unexpected twist that makes you laugh in disbelief. Tolerance of non-conformism and diverse educational backgrounds.

- With all it's problems and biases, the part of the community I grew up with did not care about gender, skin color, or parental income - everybody was green writing on a black screen. Intellectual honesty.

- When we first met in undergraduate math class, I described what I do for a living to him (reading code for subtle mistakes), and he said "that sounds like one of the worst imaginable jobs ever".

## Pennsylvania's Voting Machines Are Running Windows XP

-  Pennsylvania's Voting Machines Are Running Windows XP  (cbsnews.com) 

- Slashdot reader rmurph04 writes: As reported by CBS News, the battleground state of Pennsylvania might as well have a target on its back as Election Day nears, the cybersecurity company Carbon Black warned in a new report released Thursday.

- Across the state, most Pennsylvania counties use particularly high-risk electronic voting machines that leave behind zero paper trails, which could be useful to audit the integrity of votes cast.

- In addition, many of these machines -- called "direct-recording electronic" machines -- are running on severely outdated operating systems like Windows XP, which has not been patched by Microsoft since 2014.  According to the survey more than one in five registered U.S. voters may stay home on Election Day because of fears about cybersecurity and vote tampering.

- Respondents believe a U.S. insider threat poses the most risk (28%), followed by Russian hackers (17%) and then the candidates themselves (15%).

## Record-breaking DDoS reportedly delivered by >145k hacked cameras

- Last week, security news site KrebsOnSecurity went dark for more than 24 hours following what was believed to be a record 620 gigabit-per-second denial of service attack brought on by an ensemble of routers, security cameras, or other so-called Internet of Things devices

- Now, there's word of a similar attack on a French Web host that peaked at a staggering 1.1 terabits per second, more than 60 percent bigger.

- He said the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks were delivered through a collection of hacked Internet-connected cameras and digital video recorders. With each one having the ability to bombard targets with 1 Mbps to 30 Mbps, he estimated the botnet had a capacity of 1.5 Tbps.

## iPhone exploit bounty surges to an eye-popping $1.5 million

- A controversial broker of security exploits is offering $1.5 million for attacks that work against fully patched iPhones and iPads, a bounty that's triple the size of its previous one.

- Zerodium also doubled, to $200,000, the amount it will pay for attacks that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in Google's competing Android operating system

- Last year, Zerodium offered $1 million for iOS exploits, up to a total of $3 million

- Prices are directly linked to the difficulty of making a full chain of exploits, and we know that iOS 10 and Android 7 are both much harder to exploit than their previous versions

## ORWL  The first open source, physically secure computer

- It verifies the integrity of all firmware prior to boot, controls the power to rest of the Intel platform that runs the operating system, interfaces directly to an OLED display and NFC and BLE gateway for communicating with the secure key fob, and constantly monitors a dedicated inertial measurement unit, the active mesh (see below), the internal temperature, and input power voltage for any tampering.

- The battery itself is projected to last about six months without being connected to power. This chip was chosen because it is powerful (108 MHz Cortex M3) and offers the highest level of security, with features that you simply cannot reproduce with general purpose microcontrollers.

- Upon any tampering, the secure microcontroller instantly erases the encryption key, causing all data on the SSD to be irrevocably lost. Enveloping Active Mesh The entire ORWL system is encased in an active clamshell mesh formed by laser direct structuring (LDS), a technique for creating a resin material with finely printed circuitry designed to shatter when drilled.

- Within ORWL itself, a NXP CLRC663 chipset is used for NFC communciation and is controlled directly by the Maxim secure microcontroller. Communication between key fob and computer is encrypted and codes (including UUID) are synchronously updated on a regular basis.

- For ease of assembly, the screws are all identical: black, same length, with a Torx T8 head. Up to three bare ORWLs without any enclosures can be mounted to a specially made 1U rackmount chassis.

## Dear Cloudflare, Please Stop Doing Business With ISIS

- I decided to circle back to the site to see what has been going on with it as I originally was kinda meh about it.

- When I looked today I noticed some things that perhaps I missed before, the primary point being that this site is being hosted/protected by Cloudflare.

- What we have here is a new hybrid of darknet onion hidden site and clearnet hosted and DDoS protected content by Cloudflare.

- Of course a sustained attack on the onion server might do the trick but whos got time for that huh?

- The fact of the matter is all their shit is out there and protected by a firm that doesnt seem to give one crap about what they are hosting and protecting as long as they get paid. MEANWHILE IN OPSEC NEWS... These nitwits are commenting and leaving their hotmal, yahoo, and gmail addresses.

- This was achieved by desoldering the NAND Flash chip of a sample phone in order to physically access its connection to the SoC and partially reverse engineering its proprietary bus protocol

- By using the described and successful hardware mirroring process it was possible to bypass the limit on passcode retry attempts

## Alleged hacker Lauri Love to be extradited to US

-  Alleged hacker Lauri Love to be extradited to US

-      Media caption"I really worry for the toll it's taking on my health, and my family's," said Lauri Love An autistic man suspected of hacking into US government computer systems is to be extradited from Britain to face trial, a court has ruled.Lauri Love, 31, who has Asperger's syndrome, is accused of hacking into the FBI, the US central bank and the country's missile defence agency.Mr Love, from Stradishall, Suffolk, has previously said he feared he would die in a US prison if he was extradited.A judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court made the extradition ruling.Follow updates on this story and other Suffolk news 

-  Earlier, his lawyer said his alleged hacking had "embarrassed" US authorities.Tor Ekeland said the US government "had very, very bad security and these hacks utilised exploits that were publicly-known for months". 

-  Image caption  Lauri Love spoke to members of the press outside Westminster Magistrates' Court before the hearing  

- Mr Love's lawyers said he could face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of the hacking offences.Earlier he stood in the dock as district judge Nina Tempia ruled he could be extradited to the US, where he could face trials in three different states.He was first arrested at home in Suffolk in 2013 and had computer equipment seized by British police, who then released him on bail.He was not charged in the UK, where the investigation into him was dropped.Mr Love's defence team argues his depression and Asperger's syndrome mean he should not be sent abroad, but US prosecutors say he is using his mental health issues as an excuse to escape justice.In England and Wales, the maximum sentence for crimes such as those of which Mr Love is accused is two years and eight months.

## Team CARAMBA

- In comparison, the "real" record for discrete logarithm is 768 bits (announced this spring) and required 10 times as much computational power.

- We chose the prime number which defines the problem to be solved in a special way, so that the computation can be made much more efficient.

- Our computation raises questions about some Internet standards that contain opaque, fixed primes.

- Discrete log is the computational hardness assumption underlying Diffie-Hellman key exchange and DSA digital signatures.

- If you are a developer or standards committee member, use verifiable randomness to generate any fixed cryptographic parameters, and publicly document your seeds.

## Senate Republicans were skimmed for six months, quietly fix store  nighly secure

- And subsequently sold on the dark web for $30.Update Oct 6th: The Republicans have rushed to secure their store today.

- And we have two Russian credit card harvesters with the rather boring names jquery-cloud.net (March) and jquery-code.su (October).Follow the moneyThe older harvester jquery-cloud.net was registered in December 2015 by an American lady with a Chinese fax number and a fake email address.

- The newer harvester, jquery-code.su, is registered anonymously per 24th of August.Both domain names are hosted by a company called Dataflow, as is shown by the nameservers and IP addresses.

- Curiously, the Dataflow network and the jquery-cloud.net domain name were created in the same week:route:          80.87.205.0/24 descr:          DDoS Protected Network DATAFLOW.SU origin:         AS203624 mnt-by:         MNT-DATAFLOWSU created:        2015-12-28T22:37:25Z A hornets nestDataflow has a Russian language website but is registered in Belize on November 3rd, 2015.

## Qubes OS 3.2 has been released

- We now use this management functionality for basic system setup during installation, for preparing our automatic tests, and for applying various custom configurations.

- In the future, we envision a simple GUI application allowing users to download ready-to-use Salt recipes for setting up various things, for example:

- The price we pay for this, however, is increased attack surface on the backend, which is important in the event that several USB devices of different security contexts are connected to a single controller.

- While we hope the new default desktop environment will provide a better experience for all users, Qubes 3.2 also supports KDE, awesome, and i3 window managers.

- Existing users on Qubes 3.1 may choose to perform an in-place upgrade, though a clean installation is recommended.

## These diabetes pumps obey unencrypted radio commands  which is, frankly, f*%king stupid

- Johnson  Johnson's Animas division has issued a letter [PDF] warning diabetes patients using its OneTouch Ping insulin pump that the device could be triggered remotely. Discounting the possibility of an attack as "extremely low," the company nonetheless says that "a person could potentially gain unauthorized access to the pump through its unencrypted radio frequency communication system.

- A 2013 article in the journal Clinical Toxicology says insulin dosing errors represent one of the most dangerous medication issues because of the risk of hypoglycemia. The Animas letter advises customers who are concerned about the flaw to disable the pump's radio as a precaution.

- "Animas continues to work with the appropriate regulatory bodies and security experts on this issue as we are always evaluating ways to further ensure patient safety and enhance security," the company said. On its website, Animas cites a study that suggests its device performs better than the competing Medtronic Paradigm Bolus Wizard.

- But the two devices have something in common: In 2011, cybersecurity researcher Jay Radcliffe revealed flaws in several Medtronic insulin pump models.

- " Following the vulnerabilities revealed in 2011 and the 2012 demonstration of a pacemaker hack by Barnaby Jack at the Ruxcon Breakpoint security conference in Melbourne, Australia, the US Food and Drug Administration in 2013 began formulating cybersecurity guidance for medical device makers.

## Mastercard rolls out pay-by-selfie across Europe

- Javvad Malik, security advocate at enterprise security tools firm AlienVault, said that selfie pay is seemingly an attempt to bridge the gap between a fully authenticated method, such as chip and PIN  and unauthenticated payments methods such as contactless. The use of a selfie as an authentication mechanism may seem like something that a millennial cooked up whilst browsing Instagram one night, Malik said, however, payments have always been about risk management.

- Rather, the controls needed should be sufficient to keep fraud within tolerances whilst providing customers with a convenient experience, he added. Robert Page, lead penetration tester at Redscan struck a more cautious note. User passwords are typically the easiest point of attack in computer systems and this is driving increased adoption of biometric authentication systems, Page said.

- Voice recognition has the benefit of near-ubiquity in some companies, where the majority of people have a phone, but has proven unreliable, unable to authenticate when there is background noise. Passwords remain very common because they always work, but of course can be stolen or discovered.

- Phone apps can detect your heart rate by the pulsing flush of your skin; keyboard clacking patterns can distinguish you just like your fingerprint.

- Combined with whether your location is 'typical' or changes too quickly, identity systems can flag suspicious behaviour and prevent unwarranted access while it is happening, he concluded.

## Stingray manuals detail how police can spy on phones

- So too have law enforcement agencies at every level, across the country, evaded almost all attempts to learn how and why these extremely powerful tools are being used  though court battles have made it clear Stingrays are often deployed without any warrant.

- The San Bernardino Sheriffs Department alone has snooped via Stingray, sans warrant, over 300 times. Richard Tynan, a technologist with Privacy International, told The Intercept that the manuals released today offer the most up-to-date view on the operation of Stingrays and similar cellular surveillance devices, with powerful capabilities that threaten civil liberties, communications infrastructure, and potentially national security.

- He noted that the documents show the Stingray II device can impersonate four cellular communications towers at once, monitoring up to four cellular provider networks simultaneously, and with an add-on can operate on so-called 2G, 3G, and 4G networks simultaneously. There really isnt any place for innocent people to hide from a device such as this, Tynan wrote in an email. As more of our infrastructure, homes, environment, and transportation are connected wirelessly to the internet, such technologies really do pose a massive risk to public safety and security.  

- And the Harris software isnt just extremely powerful, Tynan added, but relatively simple, providing any law enforcement agent with a modicum of computer literacy the ability to spy on large groups of people:  The ease with which the StingRay II can be used is quite striking and there do not seem to be any technical safeguards against misuse.

- They make clear the capability of those devices and the Stingray II to spy on cellphones by, at minimum, tracking their connection to the simulated tower, information about their location, and certain over the air electronic messages sent to and from them.

## AI Can Recognize Your Face Even If Youre Pixelated

- Instead, the team found that mainstream machine learning methodsthe process of training a computer with a set of example data rather than programming itlend themselves readily to this type of attack. The techniques were using in this paper are very standard in image recognition, which is a disturbing thought, says Vitaly Shmatikov, one of the authors from Cornell Tech.

- Since the machine learning methods employed in the research are widely knownto the point that there are tutorials and training manuals onlineShmatikov says it would be possible for a bad actor with a baseline of technical knowledge to carry out these types of attacks.

- But for most of the researchers tests, they still identified the obfuscated text or face in more than 50 percent of cases.Richard McPherson, Reza Shokri, and Vitaly Shmatikov The researchers were able to defeat three privacy protection technologies, starting with YouTubes proprietary blur tool.

- If the computers had been randomly guessing to identify the faces, shapes, and numbers, however, the researchers calculated that the success rates for each test set would have been at most 10 percent and as low as a fifth of a percent, meaning that even relatively low identification success rates were still far better than guessing. Even if the groups machine learning method couldnt always penetrate the effects of redaction on an image, it still represents a serious blow to pixelation and blurring as a privacy tool, says Lawrence Saul, a machine learning researcher at University of California, San Diego.

- But based on their current findings, he argues that more practical application would likely be possible. The researchers larger goal is to warn the privacy and security communities that advances in machine learning as a tool for identification and data collection cant be ignored.

## Security company finds five zero-day flaws in EMC management console

- Digital Defense announced today that it privately revealed a set of five "zero-day" vulnerabilities in Dell EMC's vApp Manager for Unisphere for VMAX, a Web application used to manage all of EMC's storage platforms.

- The flaws would allow an attacker with access to the network storage devices to send malicious Adobe Flash Action Message Format (AMF) messages to the Web application server running on the storage system.

- That means attackers could run arbitrary commands against the storage system and potentially gain complete control of the storage devices or shut them down. Weaknesses were found in how Unisphere for VMAX, which usually runs on a "virtual appliance" on a VMware server, used the AMF protocol to send messages to five different interfaces on the Unisphere Web application server, sometimes without requiring authentication.

- Attackers that managed to exploit a connected Web server or other system in the data center would be able to take advantage.

- In a worst-case scenario, an attacker could both steal large amounts of corporate data and bring storage systems offline.

## 4Chan is on Death's Door

- Almost everything else is unmoderated, including posting non-consensual sexual imagery, threatening to kill people, and even hacking private citizens' data and releasing it.

-  In one horrific example, a 4chan user murdered a woman in Port Orchard, Washington and uploaded pictures of her body to the site.

-   With such a culture, 4chan has understandably had difficultly finding companies willing to advertise with them.

-  In the blog post, Nishimura then laid out 4chans three dire choices for survival:  4chan could halve its traffic cost by limiting the size of uploadable images, using slower servers to limit traffic, thus making the experience slower, or closing some popular boards  those dedicated to pornography, for example. 4chan could greatly expand their use of ads, which generally come from non-reputable sources and could include malware. More users could support the site using 4chan Pass, a paid feature which makes uploading images faster, but which has not been successful at offsetting costs thus far.

- You also have to determine what liability, if any, a service provider could have. On Twitter, infamous pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli teased 4chan users by offering to join the board of the site.

## Grand jury subpoena for Signal user data

- In the "first half of 2016" (the most specific we're permitted to be), we received a subpoena from the Eastern District of Virginia.

- The subpoena required us to provide information about two Signal users for a federal grand jury investigation.

- We've designed the Signal service to minimize the data we retain about Signal users, so the only information we can produce in response to a request like this is the date and time a user registered with Signal and the last date of a user's connectivity to the Signal service.

- It originally included a broad gag order that would have prevented us from publishing this notice, but the ACLU represented us in quickly and successfully securing our ability to publish the transcripts below.

- We're committed to treating any future requests the same way: working with effective and talented organizations like the ACLU, and publishing transcripts of our responses to government requests here.

## Introducing a new kind of Wi-Fi system

- Whether youre video chatting with mom, binge-watching the latest series, or simply getting work done, strong and reliable Wi-Fi is key to staying connected.Today, were excited to introduce Google Wifi, a new connected Wi-Fi system designed to give you a fast signal in every room, on every device. 

- Walls and distance make it difficult for a single device to send a strong signal to every corner of your home, resulting in slow Wi-Fi and dead zones.Last year, we introduced OnHub with partners TP-LINK and ASUS to create a better Wi-Fi experience, focusing on design and simplicity.

- These days, Wi-Fi has to be able to support lots of devices at the same time, and stand up to high-bandwidth activities like streaming video or gaming  in every room of your house.

- Google Wifi comes with Network Assist technology, which works behind the scenes to keep your Wi-Fi fast so you dont have to figure out how to adjust your router.

- For example, it has settings for easily controlling cloud management and industry-leading security features such as wireless encryption, verified boot, and auto updates to keep your network safe and secure.

## Show HN: Cypht  Unique Open Source Webmail

- Unless you are one of my daughters, in which case it is your father's webmail.

- Cypht does not replace your existing accounts - it combines them into one.

- And it's also a news reader.Unread messages from 9 E-mail accounts in one viewThe driving force behind Cypht development is to provide combined views for multiple accounts, but it's also a standard E-mail client that lets you browse and manage IMAP folders (or POP3 inboxes), and send outbound messages with SMTP.Cypht is an application built entirely of plugins, or as we call them, module sets (which is obviously way cooler sounding than plugins), that are executed by the framework.

- Modules provide a flexible way to add new features or customize the program without hacking the code.Cypht is Open Source (GPL V2), and written in PHP and JavaScript.

- If you are looking for a lightweight webmail solution for an ISP, school, business, or just personal use, I hope that Cypht can help!Have a question or comment?

## Security things in Linux v4.8

- Here are a bunch of security things Im excited about in Linux v4.8: SLUB freelist ASLR Thomas Garnier continued his freelist randomization work by adding SLUB support. x86_64 KASLR text base offset physical/virtual decoupling On x86_64, to implement the KASLR text base offset, the physical memory location of the kernel was randomized, which resulted in the virtual address being offset as well.

- Yinghai Lu, Baoquan He, and I landed a series of patches that ultimately did this (and in the process fixed some other bugs too).

- This expands the physical offset entropy to roughly $physical_memory_size_of_system / 2MB bits. x86_64 KASLR memory base offset Thomas Garnier rolled out KASLR to the kernels various statically located memory ranges, randomizing their locations with CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY.

- Im looking forward to more plugins! If youre on Debian or Ubuntu, the required gcc plugin headers are available via the gcc-$N-plugin-dev package (and similarly for all cross-compiler packages). hardened usercopy Along with work from Rik van Riel, Laura Abbott, Casey Schaufler, and many other folks doing testing on the KSPP mailing list, I ported part of PAX_USERCOPY (the basic runtime bounds checking) to upstream as CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY.

- Adding this logic will require some reorganization of usercopy code to add some new APIs, as PAX_USERCOPYs approach to handling special-cases is to add bounce-copies (copy from slab to stack, then copy to userspace) as needed, which is unlikely to be acceptable upstream. seccomp reordered after ptrace By its original design, seccomp filtering happened before ptrace so that seccomp-based ptracers (i.e. SECCOMP_RET_TRACE) could explicitly bypass seccomp filtering and force a desired syscall.

## Yahoo secretly built a tool to scan all email in realtime for US spies

-  As far as we know, the move was unprecedented in US tech history, and it triggered the departure of then-CSO Alex Stamos (previously), now CSO for Facebook.

-   The demand to search Yahoo Mail accounts came in the form of a classified directive sent to the company's legal team, according to the three people familiar with the matter.

- But some former government officials and private surveillance experts said they had not previously seen either such a broad directive for real-time Web collection or one that required the creation of a new computer program.

- Its mouthpiece doesnt stick out like most vapes, but is cleverly built into the design, featuring a small slit to inhale out of.Even though the Pax 2 is [...] READ THE REST

## Hiding root with suhide

- The installer script just edits a few files inside  initramfs (boot image ramdisk): init.zygote.rc, init.zygote32.rc, init.zygote64.rc, init.zygote64_32.rc.

- Be design, the runtime linker is going to link this library into the process before anything else, even before libc.so; the details are not in scope for this post.

- As ChainFire himself explains, this is a cat and mouse game, but ultimately 'detectors' have more chances to win.

- Ultimately, things like SafetyNet will leverage their privileged position and utilize hardware attestation, making it really hard for bypasses to follow - TrustZone rootkits excluded, I suppose.

- Some easy picks: The suhide shared library is left mapped into the process space of all apps, blacklisted or not, and setresgid() remains hooked.

## Source Code for IoT Botnet Mirai Released  Krebs on Security

- The source code that powers the Internet of Things (IoT) botnet responsible for launching the historically large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against KrebsOnSecurity last month has been publicly released, virtually guaranteeing that the Internet will soon be flooded with attacks from many new botnets powered by insecure routers, IP cameras, digital video recorders and other easily hackable devices. The leak of the source code was announced Friday on the English-language hacking community Hackforums.

- The malware, dubbed Mirai, spreads to vulnerable devices by continuously scanning the Internet for IoT systems protected by factory default or hard-coded usernames and passwords. The Hackforums post that includes links to the Mirai source code. Vulnerable devices are then seeded with malicious software that turns them into bots, forcing them to report to a central control server that can be used as a staging ground for launching powerful DDoS attacks designed to knock Web sites offline. The Hackforums user who released the code, using the nickname Anna-senpai, told forum members the source code was being released in response to increased scrutiny from the security industry. When I first go in DDoS industry, I wasnt planning on staying in it long, Anna-senpai wrote.

- Today, max pull is about 300k bots, and dropping. Sources tell KrebsOnSecurity that Mirai is one of at least two malware families that are currently being used to quickly assemble very large IoT-based DDoS armies.

- Only changing the default password protects them from rapidly being reinfected on reboot. In the days since the record 620 Gbps DDoS on KrebsOnSecurity.com, this author has been able to confirm that the attack was launched by a Mirai botnet.

- GRE lets two peers share data they wouldnt be able to share over the public network itself. One security expert who asked to remain anonymous said he examined the Mirai source code following its publication online and confirmed that it includes a section responsible for coordinating GRE attacks. Its an open question why anna-senpai released the source code for Mirai, but its unlikely to have been an altruistic gesture: Miscreants who develop malicious software often dump their source code publicly when law enforcement investigators and security firms start sniffing around a little too close to home.
