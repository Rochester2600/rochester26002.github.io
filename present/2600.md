## Statement

-  Over the past several days, a number of people have made serious, public allegations of sexual mistreatment by former Tor Project employee Jacob Appelbaum.

-  That said, after we talked with some of the complainants, and after extensive internal deliberation and discussion, Jacob stepped down from his position as an employee of The Tor Project. We have been working with a legal firm that specializes in employment issues including sexual misconduct.

- Out of respect for the individuals involved, we do not expect results to be made public. People who have information to contribute are invited to contact me.

- We recognize that many people in the information security and Internet freedom communities don't necessarily trust law enforcement.

- To that end, we will be working earnestly going forward to develop policies designed to set up best practices and to strengthen the health of the Tor community. In our handling of this situation, we aim to balance between our desire to be transparent and accountable, and also to respect individual privacy.

## Olympic Athletes To Sport Visa's New Payment Ring In Rio

- An anonymous reader writes from a report via Engadget: Visa is introducing a new ring at the Olympic Games in Rio that will let people pay for things by waving their hand -- no phone, wallet, or battery is needed.

- There will be 20 sizes available during its trial run where it will be available exclusively for employees and partners, as well as the 45 athletes sponsored by Visa.

- The athletes inspired the creation of the ring, as wallets and typical wearables can be an annoyance to them when they're constantly changing uniforms.

- As for security, the ring can be deactivated from a smartphone, and thanks to tokenization, sensitive data is replaced by a digital identifier that can be used to process payments, so thieves won't be able to use it. There has been some controversy surrounding the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.

- Some doctors have warned that the games could spark a "full-blow public health disaster" with the spread of the Zika virus.

## FBI Developing Software To Track, Sort People By Their Tattoos

- An anonymous reader writes: According to an Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) investigation, the FBI is working to create software with government researchers that will allow law enforcement to sort and identify people based off their tattoos.

- The advanced tattoo recognition technology aims to determine "affiliation to gangs, sub-cultures, religious or ritualistic beliefs, or political ideology" and decipher tattoos that "contain intelligence, messages, meaning and motivation."

- Such research first originated at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2014, and used a database of prisoner's tattoos.

- What some may view as even more unnerving is that the EFF investigation claims the researchers disregarded basic ethical government research standards, especially those relating specifically to prisoners.

- The EFF argues that a database that sorts citizens based on their tattoos may or may not reflect their religious or political beliefs, social affiliations, or interests.

## TeamViewer Hacked? It Certainly Looks Like It

- TeamViewer denies it has been hacked. In the past 24 hours, weve seen a spike in complaints from people who say their PCs, Macs and servers were taken over via the widely used remote-control tool on their machines.

- Even users with strong passwords and two-factor authentication enabled on their TeamViewer accounts say they were hit. It appears miscreants gained control of victims TeamViewer web accounts, and used those to connect into computers, where they seized web browsers to empty PayPal accounts, access webmail, and order stuff from Amazon and eBay. Hackers got everything from me, Doug, an Idaho-based Twitch streamer who was looking forward to celebrating his birthday today with his wife and two kids, told The Register. They remote connected in at 5AM MT, went into my Chrome and used my PayPal to buy about $3k worth of gift cards.

- And yes, I had two-factor authentication. Over on Reddit, people were lining up with tales of their systems being compromised via TeamViewer, sparking fears the platform had been hacked.

- In a statement bizarrely dated last week but referencing todays events, the biz instead blamed careless use of passwords by its customers.

- While many suppliers have proper security means in place, others are vulnerable, the company said. We will have to see over the next few days if TeamViewer suddenly has a change of heart and becomes a little more forthcoming about the details of an intrusion (if indeed there was one). As usual they are fingering users, with some vague statement about weak passwords or re-used passwords from other breaches. Source: The Register

## Stealth Falcon: New Malware from (Probably) the UAE

- This report describes a campaign of targeted spyware attacks carried out by a sophisticated operator, which we call Stealth Falcon.

- We discovered this campaign when an individual purporting to be from an apparently fictitious organization called "The Right to Fight" contacted Rori Donaghy.

- Donaghy has written critically of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government in the past, and had recently published a series of articles based on leaked emails involving members of the UAE government.

- Circumstantial evidence suggests a link between Stealth Falcon and the UAE government.

- We traced digital artifacts used in this campaign to links sent from an activist's Twitter account in December 2012, a period when it appears to have been under government control.

## Identifying People from their Driving Patterns

- With 90 minutes driving data or monitoring more car components, they could pick out the correct driver fully 100 percent of the time.

- The paper: "Automobile Driver Fingerprinting," by Miro Enev, Alex Takahuwa, Karl Koscher, and Tadayoshi Kohno.

- Abstract: Today's automobiles leverage powerful sensors and embedded computers to optimize efficiency, safety, and driver engagement.

- In the present study, we experimentally investigate the potential to identify individuals using sensor data snippets of their natural driving behavior.

- More specifically we record the in-vehicle sensor data on the controller area-network (CAN) of a typical modern vehicle (popular 2009 sedan) as each of 15 participants (a) performed a series of maneuvers in an isolated parking lot, and (b) drove the vehicle in traffic along a defined ~50 mile loop through the Seattle metropolitan area.

## RSA Keys Can Be Harvested With Microphones

- The team recommends encryption software writers build in "blinding" routines that insert dummy calculations into cryptographic operations. After discussions with the team, GNU Privacy Guard now does this.

- Researchers have now demonstrated that even with modern laptop, desktop, and server computers, an inexpensive attack can harvest 4,096-bit encryption keys using a parabolic microphone within 33 feet

- or even from 12 inches away, using a cellphone microphone.

- In both cases it took an hour of listening to get the 4,096-bit RSA key... As a computer's processor churns through the encryption calculations, the machine emits a high-frequency "coil whine" from the changing electrical current flowing through its components...

## Yahoo Becomes First Company To Disclose FBI National Security Letters

- Yahoo has disclosed receipt of three national security letters (FBI requests for data that Yahoo is typically barred from sharing) and published redacted copies of the letters online for anyone to see.

- The company says that the move "marks the first time any company has publicly acknowledged receiving an NSL following the reforms of the USA Freedom Act."

- The bill was created last year allowing companies to gag orders relating to National Security Letters.

- Engadget reports: It takes some doing to get permission to acknowledge the receipt of a letter, too -- Yahoo says that the FBI needs to review if the nondisclosure provision is still necessary for each specific NSL before allowing a company to publish it, and even then certain information needs to be redacted before being made available to the public.

- Still, when companies do get these gag orders lifted, it allows them to notify the investigated parties that the FBI was looking into their data, and it's a big win for transparency overall.

## There's a Stuxnet Copycat, and We Have No Idea Where It Came From

- Now, researchers have disclosed a piece of industrial control systems (ICS) malware inspired heavily by Stuxnet.

- Although the copycat malware -- dubbed IRONGATE by cybersecurity company FireEye -- only works in a simulated environment it, like Stuxnet, replaces certain types of files, and was seemingly written to target a specific control system configuration.

- [...] IRONGATE works within a simulated Siemens environment called PLCSIM, used for testing programs before they are pushed out into the field.

- Like Stuxnet, IRONGATE replaces a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), a small collection of code that can be used by different programs at the same time, with a malicious one of its own.

- IRONGATE's DLL records five seconds of traffic from the Siemens' system to the user interface, and replays it over again, potentially tricking whoever is monitoring the system into thinking everything is fine, while the malware might manipulate something else in the background.Dark Reading's coverage on this is also worth a read.

## Errata Security: Etherium/TheDAO hack simplified

- Instead, a script is used, written in  a bitcoin-specific programming language that can do things like add, multiply, and compare numbers.

- This includes your share of unspent Ethereum coins, but also tokens representing returns on investments you were part of, but which haven't yet paid out.

- It's tacit acknowledgement that TheDAO deserves special treatment that would not be given to smaller makers of contracts that have similar recursion bugs.

- TheDAO was created by people who are hopelessly naive about investing, who then put the system in the hands of trained monkeys.

- If the hacker hadn't put a stop to this nonsense, it would have slid into some sort of Ponzi scheme, getting its creators arrested a couple years from now.  Update: The hacker is bribing the miners not to fork [*], by promising to give the miners a third of Etherium.

## HTTP Header Injection in Python Urllib

- Obviously this kind of attack scenario could be very handy against internal, unauthenticated REST, SOAP, and similar services.

- Typically this service is deployed on application servers to speed up certain operations or share data between multiple instances without having to rely on slower database calls.

- Since Redis provides a TCP protocol very similar to memcached, and it also allows one to submit many erroneous commands before correct ones, the same attacks work in terms of fiddling with an application's stored data. In addition, it is possible to store files at arbitrary locations on the filesystem which contain a limited amount of attacker controlled data.

- Stated that issue is related to a general header injection bug, which has been fixed in recent versions.

- We can't continue to make the same bad assumptions of a decade ago and expect security to improve.

## Detecting Incognito Mode and Using It in Google Tag Manage

- Heres a great addition to your bag of tricks: a custom HTML  / Javascript Tag to detect  if a visitor is browsing your site in anonymous or incognito mode. Update: this turns out to be very Chrome specific.

- What is incognito mode? Browsing Incognito, or Private mode allows you to visit a website as normal, with the exception that your browsing software tries to wipe all permanent information from your computer after the session is done.  It doesnt leave any cookies Browser history is not stored Caching is disabled  Very useful if you are shopping for gifts for your spouse on a shared computer and you dont want to spoil the surprise by being retargetted  Why should I care? Users browsing incognito come and leave without cookies, so you cannot measure loyalty (return visits), and its essentialy fruitless to try to retarget them for anything.

- They will definitely not be recognised again when they re-visit your site. For some sites, this analytics problem might be bigger than for others, but its always nice to know how big the potential problem is. How to detect it? This answer on stackoverflow learned me that the window.RequestFileSystem function exists, but returns an error in incognito mode.

- is to fire a Google Analytics non-interactive event that also sets a custom session dimension, so you can easily make an advanced segment or custom report in Google Analytics. Heres the code.

-   Questions, additions, tip? Please leave a reply to this post or send a tweet to @zjuul  much appreciated.

## Apple Announces Its New Desktop OS macOS Sierra Featuring Siri, Apple Pay

- After playing with the names of cats and a few California landmarks, Apple at WWDC 2016 announced that its desktop operating system will now be called macOS -- and its first version update is macOS Sierra. It comes with a range of new features including Siri, the digital voice assistant.

- The move comes roughly a year and a half after Microsoft brought its Cortana virtual assistant to desktop platform Windows 10.

- Sierra also supports Apple Pay payment service via Safari web browser.

- Ars Technica reports about some other features of macOS Sierra:  Universal Clipboard answers a longstanding complaint of Mac and iOS users -- copying and pasting now works automatically between an iOS device and a desktop Mac device.

- Another new feature called Optimized Storage can sweep through old documents and files and push them to iCloud, clearing up local disk space for other uses.

## Let's Encrypt lets 7,600 users... see each other's email addresses

- Free certificate authority Let's Encrypt has spaffed the email addresses of up to 7,618 users to each other in an email informing them of updates to its subscriber agreement. In a post apologising for the error, the service noted that the incident wasn't as bad as it could have been, affecting only 1.9 per cent of the 383,000 users it had intended to email.  

- As the announcement explained, the blooper was committed "via an automated system which contained a bug that mistakenly prepended between 0 and 7,618 other email addresses to the body of the email.

- " "Each email mistakenly contained the email addresses from the emails sent prior to it," added Let's Encrpt, "so earlier emails contained fewer addresses than later ones.

- " The mistake, which isn't the most severe CA issue we've seen in recent times (and on a completely unrelated note, Symantec has bought Bluecoat) is the most significant to affect the business since its open beta launch last December. All the same, the HPE-backed Let's Encrypt stated: "We take our relationship with our users very seriously and apologize for the error.

- We will update this incident report with our conclusions."

## Man-in-the-middle biz Blue Coat bought by Symantec: Infosec bods are worried

- Analysis Symantecs deal to to buy Blue Coat, the controversial web filtering firm, for $4.65bn will bolster its enterprise security business. But some security experts are concerned about the potential for conflict of interest created by housing Symantecs digital certificate business and Blue Coats man-in-the-middle SSL inspection technologies under the same roof.

- One of its products is an SSL Visibility Appliance, which sits in the middle of encrypted traffic flows in order to identify threats (such as botnet communications, data exfiltration by hackers and so on). Blue Coat technology masquerades as legit websites while Symantec, who bought VeriSign's certification business six years ago, is the biggest provider of SSL certificates. Last month Blue Coat was accused of misusing an intermediate certificate authority, backed by root certificate authority Symantec.

- It also added that Symantec maintained full control of the private key, an assurance weakened by the imminent acquisition of Blue Coat by Symantec. The conflict between being simultaneously a certificate authority and certificate exploiter is huge, said Rob Graham of Errata Security, the developer of BlackICE intrusion prevention software.

- The real authorities (Microsoft, Google, Firefox, Apple) have been lax, letting CAs slide, but this time they might do something.

- On the other hand, Blue Coat is a natural fit for AV [anti-virus], letting customers AV scan things otherwise encrypted with SSL. We like the management so much, we bought the company Blue Coats web gateway appliances will be added to Symantecs existing corporate-focused email and endpoint security as well as its consumer-focused Norton anti-virus software. Traditionally Symantecs security sales were split more or less evenly between corporate and consumers sales through its Norton line. Consumer sales have become a legacy business for Symantec because Microsoft has improved its security defences, freemium anti-virus software firms such as AVG and Avast are gaining big market share, and competitors and new entrants have outflanked the company in the mobile security software market. Acquiring Blue Coat will mean that 62 per cent of Symantec's revenues will come from enterprise security and this will position it better to compete with other enterprise security heavyweights such as FireEye, Check Point Software and Palo Alto Networks. Although the shift towards the enterprise strategy is clear, Symantec has no immediate plans to sell its consumer unit, which remains profitable, Reuters reports. Symantec sold its Veritas enterprise software storage business for $7.4bn to a group led by Carlyle Group back in January as part of the same strategy of focusing on the enterprise security software market.

## Goodbye Obamaberry, hello Obamadroid

- Until recently, Obama continued to carry a BlackBerry handset, but mobile device technology shifts have finally caught up with the White House.

- Sadly, the Obamaberry is no more. In an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Barack Obama noted that he now carries a secure "smartphone" that is so locked down that he compared it to an infant's toy phone.

- While Obama didn't mention the type of handset he now carries, there's only one mobile device supported by the Defense Information Systems Agencythe agency that provides the White House with communications services.

- And the S4, layered with services managed by DISA, is the first commercial phone to get approval to connect to the Secret classified DOD SIPRNet network. DISA has been working with vendors and the National Security Agency's Information Assurance Directorate to develop a Top Secret-capable mobile device for use by the Defense Department and the national leadership both on the move and within secure facilities.

## Apple quietly launches next-gen encrypted file system

- It didn't get any airtime at the big opening day of the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), but excitement is building around Apple's next-generation file system. Early specs show the system will bring your hard drive into the modern era, most notably by supporting native encryption.

- It will also time-stamp files by nanoseconds (rather than seconds), making it better for modern databases, and take snapshots of the file system, massively reducing the time needed to make backups.  

- Other interesting features include crash protection, space sharing  which will enable much more flexible partitioning  optimization for solid-state hard drives, and a better system for cleaning up deleted files. In short, the new Apple File System (APFS) can be expected to bring significant advances in speed and efficiency, and the updating of Apple's file sharing technology, which hasn't changed in nearly 20 years (others, of course, have developed more modern systems that are now 10 years old). APFS' preliminary information has been released to developers, and sessions on it will take place this week at WWDC.

- It is scheduled to ship sometime in 2017, meaning that the company may be able to boast big performance improvements in its products toward the end of that year.

- Yep, you will have to buy more Apple gear: a new watch to go with your new phone to sync with your new laptop.

## Firefox Finally Confirms 'Largest Change Ever' Featuring Electrolysis In v48

- Mozilla has announced that Electrolysis (e10s) will be available to users starting Firefox 48.

- The foundation finds it the most significant Firefox change since the browser's inception.

- From a ZDNet report: With Electrolysis, Firefox can use child processes for content (tabs), media playback and legacy plug-ins.

- Eric Rahm has run some browser tests with Electrolysis, and says: "Overall we see a 10-20 percent increase in memory usage for the 1 content process case (which is what we plan on shipping initially).

- With 8 content processes, Rahm says: "we see roughly a doubling of memory usage on the TabsOpenSettled measurement.

## Severe Chrome Bug Allowed Arbitrary Code Execution

-  

-  Severe Chrome Bug Allowed Arbitrary Code Execution  (talosintel.com) 

- An anonymous reader quotes an article from Softpedia: Google has recently patched a high severity security bug in the Chrome browser that allowed crooks to send malicious code to your browser and take over your entire system...  Cisco's Aleksandar Nikolic was the researcher that discovered and reported the issue to Google, who even awarded him $3,000 for his efforts. 

- Chrome's built-in PDF reader PDFium used an OpenJPEG library to parse JPEG2000 files, and in Chrome it was lacking a crucial heap overflow check, according to a post on the Talos security blog.

- "By simply viewing a PDF document that includes an embedded jpeg2000 image, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's system.

## Mozilla will fund code audits for open source software

- We want to see the numerous companies and governments that use open source join us and provide additional financial support. Projects that want Mozillas help must be open source/free software and must be actively maintained, but they have a much better probability to being chosen if the software is commonly used and is vital to the continued functioning of the Internet or the Web.

- Heres a short answer: We believe our model of support is different from and complementary to CIIs, Mozilla noted. We view CII as focused on necessary, deeper-dive investments into the core OS security infrastructure, like in OpenSSL.

- Focusing on more point-in-time solutions, the SOS Funds audit and remediation methodology targets a different class of OSS projects with lower-hanging fruit security needs.

- To have substantial and lasting benefit in tackling such a significant issue as open source security, we need a broad range of solutions, including investment, audits, education, best practices, and a host of others.

- We believe the SOS Fund, alongside CII and other efforts, can help catalyze industry momentum to strengthen open source security.

## Tor onion hardening will be tear-inducing for feds  The Register

- 

- The University of California wants to defeat deanonymisation with a hardened version of the Tor browser. The uni boffins are with the Tor Project testing an address space layout randomisation (ASLR) -esque technique dubbed Selfrando.  

- It is hoped the technique described in the paper Selfrando: Securing the Tor Browser against De-anonymisation Exploits [PDF] will help to frustrate deanonymisation efforts by government agencies. Selfrando, currently under testing in hardened Tor versions, is described as an "enhanced and practical load-time randomisation technique" that defends against exploits, namely that allegedly used by the FBI. "Our solution significantly improves security over standard ASLR techniques currently used by Firefox and other mainstream browsers," the boffins say. "It has negligible run-time overhead, a perfectly acceptable load-time overhead, and it requires no changes to protect the Tor Browser. "Moreover, Selfrando can be combined with integrity techniques such as execute-only memory to further secure the Tor Browser and virtually any other C/C++ application.

- " The nine-strong research team is composed of Mauro Conti; Stephen Crane; Tommaso Frassetto; Andrei Homescu; Georg Koppen; Per Larsen; Christopher Liebchen; Mike Perry, and Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi. They cite the 2013 attacks in which the FBI compromised Tor hidden services servers to deliver an exploit to de-anonymise users. The exploit abused an use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox to gain arbitrary code execution. "The main payload of the exploit collected the MAC address and the host name from the victim machine and sent the data to an attacker-controlled web server, bypassing Tor," they write. "That message also included a unique ID provided by the booby-trapped page in order to correlate a specific user to a specific visit.

- " The team will now work to improve Selfrando's operating specific features including thread-local storage support, something relied on in Firefoxs default heap allocator jemalloc. Tor Browser developers have expressed desire to use that new allocator.

## Comparing Messaging Apps

- Comparing Messaging Apps

- Michah Lee has a nice comparison among Signal, WhatsApp, and Allo.

- In this article, I'm going to compare WhatsApp, Signal, and Allo from a privacy perspective.

- While all three apps use the same secure-messaging protocol, they differ on exactly what information is encrypted, what metadata is collected, and what, precisely, is stored in the cloud - and therefore available, in theory at least, to government snoops and wily hackers.

- EDITED TO ADD (6/25): Don't use Telegram.

## Hackers peer into Uber passenger privates, find and plot trips on maps

- 

- Three hackers have found eight holes in Uber that can reveal user e-mail addresses, and found more than 1000 of valid coupon codes including one giving drivers $100 extra in fare rides. The flaws have been reported to Uber which is working through to develop fixes.  

- The team of Vitor Oliveira (@r0t1v), Fabio Pires (@fabiopirespt) , and Filipe Reis (@fjreis) of Portugal-based consultancy Integrity described six of the since patched flaws. They kept details of the remaining holes under wraps until Uber issues fixes. "After a couple of hours, we found out two open redirects that we reported right away," the hackers say. "From a pentesters view, the security team takes this program very seriously by trying to resolve all the issues as fast as they can.

- " The team describe in detail how they chained the vulnerabilities to create more elaborate and dangerous attack scenarios, gaining access to personal information, device data, and trip histories for drivers and riders. They abused the Uber help section to find user email addresses, peered into requests during fare splits to find a passenger's picture, UUID, and phone number, and find driver and passenger trip details including the full directions of fares which can be plotted on a map. Oliveira, Pires, and Reis found a litany of discount coupons using brute force checks that Uber failed to rate-limit.

- Of those, the most valuable was a $100 Emergency Ride Home code that if applied would hand drivers a further $100 on top of regular fares. The team did not reveal how much they received as part of Uber's bug bounty cash rewards but applauded Uber for its responsiveness.

## Godless apps, some found in Google Play, can root 90% of Android phones

- Godless has struck hardest at users in India, Indonesia, and Thailand, but so far less than 2 percent of those infected are in the US. Once an app with the malicious code is installed, it has the ability to pull from a vast repository of exploits to root the particular device it's running on.

- Trend Micro Mobile Threats Analyst Veo Zhang wrote: Godless is reminiscent of an exploit kit, in that it uses an open-source rooting framework called android-rooting-tools.

- The remaining exploits are deprecated and relatively unknown even in the security community. In addition, with root privilege, the malware can then receive remote instructions on which app to download and silently install on mobile devices.

- Even worse, these threats can also be used to install backdoors and spy on users. The first Godless apps stored the rooting exploits in a binary file called libgodlikelib.so directly on an infected device.

- The client can also leave feedback in Google Play to fraudulently improve certain apps rankings. More recent Godless apps download the rooting exploit and payload from the server located at hxxp://market[.]moboplay[.]com/softs[.

## withdk/badusb2-mitm-poc

- So how is this any different from existing USB hardware implants like the Rubber Ducky, or keyloggers

- Firstly, the devices I've seen can only achieve one or two attack classes such as eavesdropping or message fabrication

- BadUSB2 can eavesdrop, replay, modify, fabricate, exfiltrate data and BadUSB in one device

- Furthermore, when combining these attack classes really interesting attack scenarios begin to surface.

- Secondly, keyboard emulation devices register as an additional USB device making them easy to detect and block, i.e. why do I now have two keyboards attached!?

- BadUSB2 is an INLINE hardware implant giving it the stealth of a hardware keylogger but far more capabilities as mentioned above

## Coinbase adds support for PayPal and Credit Cards

-   One of our objectives at Coinbase is to add as many funding mechanisms as possible to make exchanging digital currency easy.

- As a step in that direction, Coinbase now accepts PayPal (for bitcoin sells) and credit cards (for bitcoin buys). Thousands of Coinbase users use PayPal for their fiat currency transactions around the world.

- Through this integration, Coinbase users are now able to sell BTC and have their USD funds deposited to a PayPal wallet.

- In the future, we hope to add support for other countries, and to support buys through PayPal as well. As you may recall, we launched debit card buys a few months ago.

- Well invite more users to each service over the next few weeks, and well be expanding to more countries in the coming months. To get started, visit the payment methods page on Coinbase.com or tap "Settings" and then "Payment Methods" on iOS or Android. Your feedback is important to us.

## PayPal Dumped Cloud Company After It Refused To Monitor Customers' Files

-    dropped it as a customer because it refused the payment companys demands to spy on its users data. Seafile GmbH informed its customers on Saturday that they would no longer be able to pay for the service using PayPalthe only payment method that the company had in place. Were looking into alternative payment services, but currently were running a cloud service and not getting paid, CEO Silja Jackson told Fortune.  Get Data Sheet, Fortunes technology newsletter. Seafile was founded in 2009 by students at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and has in the last couple years gained enough traction in Germany to form a subsidiary there. The company claims a total of 250,000 users, many in universities.

- It offers an open-source file-synchronization system that organizations can install on their own serversfor a fee, if they want enterprise featuresand last October the firm decided to also start offering a paid version thats hosted on Seafiles German servers, for individuals and small businesses. According to Jackson, PayPal contacted Seafile in early June with a questionnaire about its service, and by posting a notice on Seafiles PayPal account to say it was violating an unspecified part of PayPals terms of use. Jackson said her team got the feeling that PayPal classified Seafile as a service for illegal file-sharing.

- She said the company explained to PayPal that it did not offer free accounts and that customers needed to disclose their address when signing up. According to Seafile, PayPal then demanded that Seafile monitor its customers data traffic and files for illegal content, and send the payment firm detailed statistics about the types of files synchronized over the service. In our opinion and our lawyers opinion, that would violate privacy laws, said Jackson.

- But we decided this morning to offer the service for free until we find a solution...When we have a different payment solution, those who want can start paying us, and the rest can terminate their accounts. PayPal told Fortune that it did not comment on specific merchant accounts, to respect the privacy of our customers and for confidentiality reasons. However, the company said it takes its legal obligations seriously. To meet our compliance obligations, we periodically review the operations of our file sharing merchants, PayPal said.

- Merchants who do not meet the requirements of our review may no longer be allowed to use PayPals services. UPDATE: PayPal then sent a follow-up statement noting that its policies regarding file sharing services dont focus on encryption alone. In our role as a global payments provider we must look at the full details of a services operations and compliance, including how the company addresses the laws and regulations related to the sharing or dissemination of illegal content as well as the policies of PayPals processing banks and card networks, it said.

## Mark Zuckerberg's Twitter and Pinterest password was 'dadada'

- Mark Zuckerbergs Twitter and Pinterest accounts were hacked over the weekend. The breach apparently happened after the Facebook bosss login details were exposed via the recent LinkedIn password dump.  

- " Richard Parris, chief exec at digital identity firm Intercede, commented: Reports that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerbergs social media accounts have been hacked should concern us all.

- If Mr Social Medias accounts can be compromised, with all of the knowledge and resources he and his team have available, we should all be taking notice.

- In fact, we should all be very angry  the vast majority of the recently reported account compromises appear to relate to leaked usernames and passwords. Its been demonstrated time after time that the simple username and password combination is a fundamentally flawed approach to internet security, but that is typically all we are offered to protect our identity and our data, he added. Stephen Cox, chief security architect at SecureAuth, argued that the breach highlighted security shortcomings even with stronger two-step verification, where users need to use a code submitted to a pre-registered mobile phone as well as passwords in order to log into online accounts. The news that Mark Zuckerbergs Twitter and Pinterest accounts have been breached following the LinkedIn attack goes to show the serious extent to which password re-use, and simple forms of authentication, can have huge knock on effects to online security, Cox said. It also serves as a reminder that two-step verification, which LinkedIn supports for all of its users, is not enough in this age of rapidly advancing attacker capability.

- We must innovate in our approach to authentication, taking us far beyond traditional username and password and even vanilla two-factor approaches.

## Chrome's PDF reader has arbitrary code execution flaw

- 

- A Researcher at Cisco's Talos limb have discovered an arbitrary code execution flaw in PDFium, the PDF reader installed by default in Google's Chrome browser. CVE-2016-1681, discovered by Talos' Aleksandar Nikolic, means that PDF that includes an embedded jpeg2000 image can trigger an exploitable heap buffer overflow.  

- The flaw looks like it is down to a tiny error by Chrome's developers, as Nikolic writes that An existing assert call in the OpenJPEG library prevents the heap overflow in standalone builds, but in the build included in release versions of Chrome, the assertions are omitted. That omission means that when PDFium invokes the OpenJPEG library, it can create a buffer overflow.

- Once that's happened, bad guys can go to town with their own code. Nikolic writes that Google has fixed the flaw, with a single line of code that changed an assert to an if. You can take advantage of that change by simply keeping Chrome up to date: version 51.0.2704.63 makes the change to knock the bug on the head.

- Chrome auto-updates unless instructed to do otherwise, so most users will be protected. Google acted with impressive speed after learning of the bug: Nikolic says Talos reported the flaw on May 19th and that Google fixed it on May 25th.

## Analysis of Twitter.com Leak

- This data set was provided to us by a user who goes by the alias "Tessa88@exploit.im", and has given us permission to name them in this blog. LeakedSource is a search-engine capable of searching over 1.8 billion leaked records -- an aggregation of data from hundreds of disparate sources.

- If your personal information appears in our copy of the Twitter credentials, or in any other leaked database that we possess, you may remove yourself for free Since embarking on this ambitious project just a handful of months ago, we have processed an unbelievable amount of data.

- Some browsers store passwords as "blank" if you don't enter a password when you save your credentials. The top email domains don't match up to a full database leak, more likely the malware was spread to Russians. Also we triple checked, Mark Zuckerberg isn't in this data set.

- Remember that Twitter probably doesn't store the passwords in plaintext, Chrome and Firefox did. For subscribed LeakedSource users, we are only displaying the first 3 characters of passwords, with a form that will allow you to validate if yours was leaked until Twitter responds to us.

- Anybody can verify that this form does not transmit any password information to LeakedSource, the verification is done by your browser.

## Your DNS Provider Should Not Be Your Registrar

- Note: This article references events that happened in December 2014.

- Hopefully, by time you're reading this DNSimple will have recovered from their DDoS-powered outage.

- The cheapest insurance you can buy is to host your nameservers and your registrar at different companies. That way, if your registrar gets attacked it's no big deal because they're not involved with your day-to-day name resolution, and if your nameservers are attacked you can easily change them.

- Splitting your DNS services between two or more companies adds a tiny bit of one-time overhead to setting up a new domain name, but the peace of mind this strategy buys is worth it.

-  Pete Keen writes at PeteKeen.net about topics ranging from Ruby to Arduino and everything in between.

## APFS in Detail

- Its a stand-alone, from-scratch implementation (an earlier version of this post noted a dependency on Core Storage, but Dominic set me straight).

- Apple will be delivering APFS broadly with 3-4 years of development so will need to accelerate quickly to maturity.  Paying Down Debt HFS was introduced in 1985 when the Mac 512K (of memory!

- Wikipedia lists nanosecond timestamps, checksums, snapshots, and sparse file support among those missing features.

- In general it first brings the derelict building up to code. Compression is an obvious gap in the APFS feature list that is common in many file systems.

- To appeal to Dominics BeOS nostalgia I even recalled my job interview with Be in 2000 when they talked about how compression actually improved overall performance since data I/O is far more expensive than computation (obvious now, but novel then).

## Anti-if: The Missing Patterns

- The first problem with if statements is that they often make it easy to modify code in bad ways

- The second problem with if statements is when they are duplicated. This means means a domain concept is missing

- The third problem with if statements is that you have to simulate execution in your own head. You must beome a mini-computer. Thats taking away from your mental energy,

- Pattern 1: Boolean Params

- Pattern 2: Switch to Polymorphism

- Patten 3: NullObject/Optional over null passing

- Patten 4: Inline statements into expressions

- Pattern 5: Give a coping strategy

## Intel Release New Technology Specifications to Protect Against ROP Attacks

- What makes it hard to detect or prevent ROP/JOP is the fact that attacker uses existing code running from executable memory.

- Based on prior experience with defining instruction set extensions, and enabling challenges associated with a new ISA, we set goals to have an ISA for ROP/JOP prevention that is transparent to most well designed/implemented software requiring minimal to no changes; yet allow opt out capability for SW that requires changes.

- We also wanted to ensure that software enabled for CET works on legacy platforms without changes (albeit with no security benefits).

- Finally, and most importantly, we wanted to address all known ROP/JOP attacks. While we include a brief description of CET here, there is no substitute for careful reading of the complete specification.

- Thus if ENDBRANCH is not target of indirect branch or jump, the CPU generates an exception indicating unintended or malicious operation.

## Confessions of a $20K bootcamp graduate

- The second 6 weeks youre basically learning on your own.The material is divided in sprints, you have to understand and remember the topic in 2 days, hacking through it, while paired with another student.

- After a 2 day sprint you see a rushed video youre supposed to learn from, if you need help during the sprints you get in queue to get help from a recent graduate who himself barely knows the material to help you.To resume: Youre getting an hour long lecture, after which you have two days to work on the new topic, after which you get a 1h long video of the instructor explaining how he would have solved the assignment.

- I even had an interview where the interviewer happened to be a hack reactor graduate, he was complaining about the latter.The idea itself is becoming outdated. They just updated their outcomes data going from 99% of grads find a job in 3 months, to 98% of grads find a job in 6 month that just does not seem reasonable by any standards.Another observation, most people who get in, are already qualified people, with top university degrees.

- Publish numbers like 99% get a job or 3% acceptance rate by manipulating the fine print.TL,DR.Hack Reactor is not the best learning program out there, theyre trying to save a concept that was working 2 years ago and that is no more.

- I encourage all recent Hack Reactor graduates to write about their own experiences to raise awareness about the program.Nori Maki Arare

## Myth debunking: WebViews suck, everything should be native

- Then wait for the confounded looks on their face and the subtle ouch, sorry nodding of the head.The reason people feel that way is because weve been conditioned to think the right way to build apps is by making everything a native screen.

- Webviews are wonderful and offer us incredible scale, flexibility, freedom, and happiness.200 screens, 2 programmers, 1 designer, 40 hour weeks, 3 vacations, 1 sabbaticalBeing a small company is something we hold dear at Basecamp  its a core value of the company.But Basecamp 3 is not a small app  its feature set is both broad and deep.

- And on launch day, we had full coverage of Basecamp 3, on-time, in-scope, and without burning anyone out.If your app is moderately large, and keeping your team small and sane is something your team values, you need webviews.Programmer happiness and native level-upsOne argument the all-native camp makes is that native screens are simply better all around.

- Turbolinks Android takes care of the rest  providing you with everything you need for ultra-fast page loads from a single, low-memory webview instance.Scaling our apps with independent, complementary teamsWebviews give us immediate and amazing scale across platforms.

- No team is ever stymied in deploying new stuff to customers, and every platform, including our Android app, automatically improves.So there you have it  weve reaped a bunch of amazing benefits from webviews, a component that gets more scorn than love in the Android world.But remember, one size does not fit all.

## Police use new device to seize money in bank accounts or on prepaid cards

- Now, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol has a device that also allows them to seize money in your bank account or on prepaid cards.

- called an ERAD, or Electronic Recovery and Access to Data machine, and state police began using 16 of them last month.

- If a trooper suspects you may have money tied to some type of crime, the highway patrol can scan any cards you have and seize the money.

- "We're gonna look for different factors in the way that you're acting, Oklahoma Highway Patrol Lt. John Vincent said

- "If you can prove can prove that you have a legitimate reason to have that money it will be given back to you.

- ERAD Group Inc., $5,000 for the software and scanners, then 7.7 percent of all the cash the highway patrol seizes.

## Facing Data Deluge, Secret U.K. Spying Report Warned of Intelligence Failure

- from the Service being unable to access potentially life-saving intelligence from data that it has already collected. A draft copy of the report, obtained by The Intercept from National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, is marked with the classification U.K.

- An investigation into the incident found that the two perpetrators were well-known to MI5, but the agency had missed significant warning signs about the men, including records of phone calls one of them had made to an al Qaeda-affiliated radical in Yemen, and an online message in which the same individual had discussed in graphic detail his intention to murder a soldier. The new revelations raise questions about whether problems sifting through the troves of data collected by British spies may have been a factor in the failure to prevent the Rigby killing.

- One of its main functions is to act as a kind of intermediary, managing the highly sensitive data-sharing relationships that exist among British telecommunications companies and law enforcement and spy agencies. Perhaps the most important program the Centre helps deliver is code-named PRESTON, which covertly intercepts phone calls, text messages, and internet data sent or received by people or organizations in the U.K. who have been named as surveillance targets on warrants signed off by a government minister. A top-secret 2009 study found that, in one six-month period, the PRESTON program had intercepted more than 5 million communications.

- GCHQs definition of metadata is broad and also encompasses location data that can be used to track peoples movements, login passwords, and website browsing histories, as The Intercept has previously revealed. The MILKWHITE program was developed as early as September 2009, and it seems to have been operational under both the Labour and the Conservative-Liberal Democrat governments of that period.

- The compromise review recently announced is a poor substitute and without the time and technical expertise, will struggle to address this issue of national importance. GCHQ declined to answer questions for this story.

## Who Blames the Victim?

- the more strongly you privilege loyalty, obedience and purity

- as opposed to values such as care and fairness

- the more likely you are to blame the victim.

- Other people privilege loyalty, obedience and purity. These are binding values, as they promote the cohesion of your particular group or clan.

## Barium-144 Nucleus Is Surprisingly Pear Shaped

- Moreover, it may be more distorted than theorists expected, a finding that could challenge current nuclear structure models.   The most direct test of whether a nucleus is pear shaped is to look for so-called octupole transitions between nuclear states, which are suppressed in more symmetric nuclei.

- Using this method, researchers have confirmed that radium-224, radium-226, and a few other heavy nuclei are pear shaped.

- But until now, there were no techniques that allowed a sufficient number of the short-lived barium isotopes to be prepared and studied before they decayed.   A team of scientists from the US, the UK, and France used Argonne National Labs CARIBU fission source and ATLAS accelerator to prepare a beam of  144Ba, which they collided with a lead foil to kick the nuclei into excited states.

- By analyzing the spectrum of gamma rays emitted by the nuclei, the researchers found that the strengths of several octupole transitionsand hence the distortionwere more than twice the values predicted by nuclear structure models.

- But its too soon to say because the experimental uncertainty in the measured distortion is still large.   This research is published in Physical Review Letters.   Jessica ThomasDirect Evidence of Octupole Deformation in Neutron-Rich Ba144B.

## Facebook uses location to suggest new friends

- Thanks to tracking the location of users smartphones, the social network may suggest you friend people youve shared a GPS data point with, meaning your friend suggestions could include someone whose face you know, but whose name you didnt until Facebook offered it up to you. Last week, I met a man who suspected Facebook had tracked his location to figure out who he was meeting with.

- We show you people based on mutual friends, work and education information, networks youre part of, contacts youve imported and many other factors. One of those factors is smartphone location.

- Or if you meet awesome new people at a party, but forget to exchange numbers, last names, or Snapchat handles, Facebook could make new friendships happen by surfacing those party-goers to you.

- Those are best case scenarios. But there are plenty of scenarios in which Facebook casually connecting you with people because your phones were in the same place at the same time could end disastrously.

- Imagine going to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and then getting Friend suggestions the next day for members of the group along with their full names and profile information.

## Selfrando: Q and A with Georg Koppen

- We also have a working product, Tor Browser, that easily reaches 1 to 2 million users, with testing channels where one can try new defenses first and refine them as needed, as we are doing with the Selfrando project.

- A more conservative approach is pointing to Tor browser version 7.0. Thats a pretty long time from now (next Spring!)

-  Selfrando's development is good so far and the browser integration work has not been so tricky; the main problem is being confident enough that it does not break some random user setups while everything is fine and working on our testing machines. Specifically, we need more experienced people running Linux 64-bit operating systems to download and try our hardened nightly builds.

- Obviously, these are test versions of the Tor Browser--we're trying to look for bugs. Will there will be future collaborations with these researchers? To port Selfrando to Windows and OSX and make it available to our users, yes! How do you feel about the fact that the research community is teaming up with Tor to strengthen Tor browser against attacks? I think this is great as it gives us another valuable ally to make our users safer.

- And in the longer run, all other users with "normal" browsers could benefit from that, too.         ______________________________________________________________ The researchers behind Selfrando will present their project in July at the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium in Darmstadt, Germany. An advance copy of their research paper is available here. Selfrando is available for use in other open-source projects on Github.

## US border authority seeks travellers' social media details

-   

- Travellers seeking visa waiver entry to the US may soon be asked to list their social media profiles - if a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposal is enacted.An update to application forms would ask users to identify what social networks they use and their "social media identifier" such as a username.However, revealing this information would be "optional".The changes would affect Esta and Form I-94W applications.The proposal was added to the Federal Register by Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part of the DHS, last Thursday.

- Any data travellers choose to share will be used "for vetting purposes, as well as applicant contact information", the proposal states.Public comment - which must be submitted by post - will be sought for 60 days before the CBP considers it further.Profiles, please"It's very hard to see travellers not filling out this item - even though it's optional - as they may fear not getting entry into the country," commented Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Centre for Democracy and Technology.                                                                                                    Mr Hall, who spotted the notice last week, added that he feels the measure could make it harder for people to enter the US."Democracy in general requires having spaces free from government scrutiny and increasingly social life happens online," he told the BBC."We would have a poor society if people were chilled from participating in social activity online so I really hope they rethink this.

- " 

- A spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents pointed out that the proposal was not guaranteed to go ahead."Just as with any change in entry requirements, the DHS will need to balance security issues against the need to encourage people to visit their country," he added.Last year, MSNBC published a memo in which it appeared that officials dropped a plan to vet visa - not visa waiver - applicants' social media activity.Recently, the United States updated its policy on visa waiver programs regarding visitors who had a second citizenship in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Sudan - or who had visited those countries within the last five years.Such individuals must now apply for a visa instead.

## Project Zero: A year of Windows kernel font fuzzing #1: the results

- Last but not least, the two powerful virtual machines executing programs describing glyph outlines in the TrueType and OpenType formats have proven vastly useful for creating reliable exploitation chains, thanks to the ability to perform arbitrary arithmetic, bitwise and other operations on data in memory.

-  In the context of vulnerability hunting, however, FreeType is a relatively easy target  its open-source nature enables very convenient source code manual auditing with full understanding of the underlying logic, makes it possible to employ static analysis algorithms, and allows us to compile in any kind of instrumentation into the final binary, with low runtime overhead (as compared to DBI).

-  With this in mind, we started a Windows kernel font fuzzing effort in May 2015, in an attempt to take what was previously known on the subject, and push each part of the process a bit forward, optimizing them or trying to achieve maximum effectiveness.

- It's also worth noting that while the elevation of privileges scenario is mitigated in Windows 10 by the architectural shift to performing font rasterization in a user-mode process with restricted privileges, an RCE in the context of that process is still a viable option (although much more limited than directly compromising the ring-0 security context).  Collisions  There is no better validation of the value of any particular defensive bug hunting effort, than observing your reported bugs colliding with weaponized exploits used in the wild (bonus points for 0-days utilized to harm users).

-  On an unrelated note, the case is a great example of how just reading the official specification carefully may hand you a critical vulnerability with very little effort and no auditing or fuzzing involved whatsoever.

## Australian 'Bitcoin founder' quietly bidding for patent empire

- It forms the core of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by maintaining a decentralized record of all transactions.Proponents say it has the potential to disrupt financial services by making payments and the settling of securities transactions, in particular, far cheaper.Patents that Wright has applied for range from a mechanism for paying securely for online content to an operating system for running an "internet of things" on blockchain.

- A patent schedule, one of a number of documents relating to the applications shown to Reuters by a person close to the EITC Holdings, outlines plans to apply for about 400 in total.

- "SATOSHI NAKAMOTO"?The London Review of Books (LRB) on Saturday ran an article by novelist and journalist Andrew O'Hagan quoting associates of Wright's as saying that they were working on filing several hundred patents.

- Wright failed to persuade a skeptical bitcoin community in May that he was Nakamoto, performing a U-turn on his promise to provide further proof and saying that he lacked the "courage" to put "years of anonymity and hiding behind" him.

- He has since kept a low profile and declined interviews.While there is no conclusive proof about his authorship of bitcoin, documents seen by Reuters suggest that Wright has had a deep association with the cashless money system since long before it went live.

## Wormable remote code execution flaws discovered in Symantec/Norton antivirus

-   The problem with both of these solutions is that theyre hugely complicated and prone to vulnerabilities; its extremely challenging to make code like this safe.

-   On Linux, Mac and other UNIX platforms, this results in a clean heap overflow as root in the Symantec or Norton process.

-   Symantec has implemented an I/O abstraction layer that exposes the PowerPoint streams stored in a Compound File via a stdio-like interface.

-   I wrote a simple test case that triggers the vulnerability, and it crashes reliably with the Aggressive mode, but didnt work in the default configuration.

-   All PROT_EXEC mappings on Norton Antivirus use ASLR on Windows, but the decomposer library is part of a 32-bit process.

## SMS Spoofing with Python for Good and Evil

- I was an excitable graduate going through the second puberty of discovering that if you propositioned customers in the right way, a small percentage of them would buy your stuff. Having been reasonably successful with personalized emails, it seemed that SMS was fair game as an extension.

- Fuck, Dominos and Royal Mail do it, and theyre only partially more time-relevant than a sale on a website you bought a novelty Luis Suarez biting bottle opener from two years ago.

- Sublime.  Turned out he was really ill and I made a basic arithmetic error which resulted in the texts continuing through the night instead of being spread over a couple of hours, so that was rather less funny than it could have been, but I was hardly to know that at the time.

- Now we know. Here you have a trivially simple method of injecting legit-looking messages into text conversations with anyone, providing you know how your target stores the spoofee sender in their contacts.

- How many friendships and/or relationships have fallen afoul of a simple misunderstanding, a simple miscommunication, one statement taken the wrong way, such as could be easily achieved through the above means? How many fledgling romances need a seductive kick-start to get them over the stalemate of shyness? Given that your communication is limited to one-way, what series of messages should you go with for maximum impact, and maximum imperviousness to whatever the replies might be? Could you even construct some confusing pseudo-two-way thing, if you knew the numbers of both parties?

## Google's version of the W3C's video DRM has been cracked

-  This DRM system uses two pieces: the EME component, which handles key exchanges and other high-level functions, and a "Content Decryption Module," which converts the scrambled video received by the computer into an unscrambled form for playback in the browser.

- David Livshits, a security researchers at Ben-Gurion University and  Alexandra Mikityuk from Berlin's Telekom Innovation Laboratories, discovered a vulnerability in the path from the CDM to the browser, which allows them to capture and save videos after they've been decrypted.

-  Under German law -- derived from Article 6 of the EUCD -- Mikityuk could face criminal and civil liability for revealing this defect, as it gives assistance to people wishing to circumvent Widevine.

- As many esteemed security researchers from industry and academe told the Copyright Office last summer, they routinely discover bugs like this, but don't come forward, because of the potential liability from anti-circumvention law.

## How Signal Beats WhatsApp

- Which is why it was huge news among encryption advocates when the company a year and a half ago announced a partnership with Open Whisper Systems to integrate the Signal protocol into its product.

- Google isnt releasing details  how the encryption works, if its possible for users to independently verify that its secure, or if metadata of the calls will be retained on Googles servers  until its publicly released. Allo and Duo will both be covered under Googles privacy policy.

- The server responds with the contacts that you have in common and then immediately discards the query, according to Marlinspike. If you back up your phone to your Google or iCloud account, Signal doesnt include any of your messages in this backup.

- If you install WhatsApp, chances are a lot of your contacts are already using it, and you can begin having encrypted conversations with minimal effort. Signal also has fewer features and gets improved at a slower pace than its corporate competitors.

- WhatsApp has a desktop version that works regardless of the type of phone you use. Marlinspike told me that Open Whisper Systems has three full-time staff: two software developers and one person who handles user support and project management.

## Chatbot lawyer overturns 160,000 parking tickets in London and New York

- Photograph: Alamy   An artificial-intelligence lawyer chatbot has successfully contested 160,000 parking tickets across London and New York for free, showing that chatbots can actually be useful. Dubbed as the worlds first robot lawyer by its 19-year-old creator, London-born second-year Stanford University student Joshua Browder, DoNotPay helps users contest parking tickets in an easy to use chat-like interface. The program first works out whether an appeal is possible through a series of simple questions, such as were there clearly visible parking signs, and then guides users through the appeals process. The results speak for themselves.

- In the 21 months since the free service was launched in London and now New York, DoNotPay has taken on 250,000 cases and won 160,000, giving it a success rate of 64% appealing over $4m of parking tickets. I think the people getting parking tickets are the most vulnerable in society.

- I think theyre being exploited as a revenue source by the local government, Browder told Venture Beat. The bot was created by the self-taught coder after receiving 30 parking tickets at the age of 18 in and around London.

- The process for appealing the fines is relatively formulaic and perfectly suits AI, which is able to quickly drill down and give the appropriate advice without charging lawyers fees.     Joshua Browder (@jbrowder1) June 26, 2016 It always brightens my day to receive these emails.

- But having started with parking tickets, Browders next challenge for the AI lawyer is helping people with flight delay compensation, as well as helping the HIV positive understand their rights and acting as a guide for refugees navigating foreign legal systems. At the same time, Browder is exploring a developer platform that only requires legal knowledge, not a coding background, which could spawn further useful chatbots to help dispense simple legal advice without exorbitant fees. At the very least, Browders robot lawyer shows that chatbots can be used for more than just ordering pizza or being spammed by news organisations.  Move over, chatbots: meet the artbots Meet our experimental Guardian Sous-Chef Facebook messenger bot

## hashcat v3.00

- This was often very frustrating for new users who may have been following along with a tutorial for the wrong application.  Developers no longer need to back-port one hash-mode from hashcat to oclHashcat or vice versa.

-  To make it even easier for everyone to compile hashcat from sources (which hopefully also increases the number of commits from the community), I've decide to add a target for a native build.

- That was always a problem with NVML provided by the Nvidia drivers; we had to manually symlink them to get them working.  The installed library does not need to be of the same version as the one used by the person who compiled the hashcat binary.

- For example, if you remember this error you know what I'm talking about: Quote:./oclHashcat64.bin: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenCL.so.1: version 'OPENCL_2.0' not found (required by ./oclHashcat64.bin)  Package maintainers should now have a really easy job.

- To prevent users sending in invalid "bug" reports related to performance, I decided to add the clock and memory rate of the current GPU to the status display.

- The entire database of 427 millions password that were stolen years ago from the once great social network MySpace is now available online for anyone to see.

- Thomas White, an independent security researcher who goes under the handle TheCthulhu, posted it on his site on Wednesday.

- Eventually data will make it to the complete blatant clear web, just sometimes we get it first, a LeakedSource operator told me in an online chat.

## StartEncrypt considered harmful today - Computest

-  Recently, one of our hackers (Thijs Alkemade) found a critical vulnerability in StartComs new StartEncrypt tool, that allows an attacker to gain valid SSL certificates for domains he does not control.

- In the current age of surveillance and cybercrime, this is a great step forwards, since it enables website owners to provide their visitors with better security at small effort and no cost. However, there is a lot that can go wrong with the automated issuance of SSL certificates.

- If the proof is found, the API returns a certificate to the client, which then installs it in your config. However, it appears that the StartEncrypt tool did not receive proper attention from security-minded people in the design and implementation phases.

- This opens up the possibility of a Duplicate-Signature Key Selection attack, just like what Andrew Ayer discovered in the ACME protocol while LetsEncrypt was in beta, see also this post.

- Although they appreciated the issues for the impact they had and were swift in their response, it is apparent that too little attention was paid to security both in design (allowing the user to specify the path) and implementation (for instance in following redirects, static linking against a vulnerable library, and so on).

## Alarm systems alarmingly insecure. Oh the irony | Pen Test Partners

- Grade 2 means that it is suitable for domestic premises and lower risk commercial. We cant link to the standard, because you need to pay for it unfortunately. This states two important figures on jamming (or intentional interference):  Requirement for the detection of a failure of periodic communication i.e.

- It can be done cheaper though  A simple OOK transmitter, modulated using a 555 timer would do the job for proactive jamming. If we want to do reactive packet or bit jamming, then we can use a CC1110 board, and program it with custom code.

- Its not just burglars anymore; mischief makers all over the Internet love playing with anything connected. They will quite happily spend a lot more time and effort than you might think to achieve these goals. From LED traffic signs, to billboards, to heating controllers, to PA systems, to baby monitors.

- You can no longer assume your attacker is unskilled and only has a multimeter at their disposal.  Your wider network is at risk Along with DVRs and IP cameras, alarms are now often powerful embedded computers.

- It has been considered broken for hundreds of years. Better still, the encryption key used for this cipher is the same across every single device. The real kicker though is that there is no way to update the firmware remotely, leaving the devices with little chance of being fixed. What should you do? If you already have a wireless alarm, dont panic.

## Google Found Disastrous Symantec and Norton Vulnerabilities That Are 'As Bad As It Gets'

- Google's Project Zero team has discovered a heap of critical vulnerabilities in Symantec and Norton security products.

- The flaws, the team says, allow hackers to completely compromise people's machines by simply sending them malicious self-replicating code through unopened emails or un-clicked links.

- Dan Goodin, reporting for Ars Technica:The flaws reside in the engine the products use to reverse the compression tools malware developers use to conceal their malicious payloads.

- Because Symantec runs the unpackers directly in the operating system kernel, errors can allow attackers to gain complete control over the vulnerable machine.

- Tavis Ormandy, a researcher with Google's Project Zero, said a better design would be for unpackers to run in a security "sandbox," which isolates untrusted code from sensitive parts of an operating system.

## Google's 'FASTER' 9000km, 60Tbps Transpacific Fiber Optics Cable Completed

- An anonymous reader writes from a report via 9to5Google: Google and an association of telecom providers have announced that the FASTER broadband cable system that links Japan and the United States is now complete.

- The system is the fastest of its kind and stretches nearly 9,000 km across the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, starting in Oregon and ending in two landing spots in Japan.

- At 60 terabits per second, FASTER will help "support the expected four-fold increase in broadband traffic demand between Asia and North America."

- The system uses a six-fiber pair cable and the latest 100Gbps digital coherent optical transmission technology.

- The service is scheduled to start on June 30, 2016, and will help increase the connectivity between Google's data centers scattered around the globe.

## Tesla driver killed in crash with Autopilot active, NHTSA investigating | The Verge

- The company revealed the crash in a blog post and says it informed the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the incident and said NHTSA is investigating. The accident occurred on a divided highway, when a tractor trailer drove across the highway perpendicular to the Model S. Neither the driver, who is ultimately responsible for the vehicles actions even with Autopilot on, nor the car noticed the big rig or the trailer "against a brightly lit sky" and brakes were not applied.

- The NHTSA investigation, Tesla says, is a "preliminary evaluation" to determine if the Autopilot system was working properly. In the blog post, Tesla reiterates that customers are required to agree that the system is in a "public beta phase" before they can use it, and that the system was designed with the expectation that drivers keep their hands on the wheel and that the driver is required to "maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle.

- " Some autonomous driving experts have criticized Tesla for introducing the Autopilot feature, with a Volvo engineer saying the system "gives you the impression that it's doing more than it is."

- That is not the case, and the driver is ultimately responsible for the actions of the vehicle, even with Autopilot active.

- Volvo has said that it will take full legal liability for all its cars when they are operating in fully autonomous mode, and plans to launch a limited trial of its autonomous Drive Me technology next year. Developing...

## Secret Rules Make It Pretty Easy for the FBI To Spy on Journalists

- The classified rules, obtained by The Intercept and dating from 2013, govern the FBIs use of National Security Letters

- which allow the bureau to obtain information about journalists calls without going to a judge or informing the news organization being targeted

- the NSL targets a journalist in order to identify confidential news media sources. In that case, the general counsel and the executive assistant director must first consult with the assistant attorney general for the Justice Departments National Security Division.

- But if the NSL is trying to identify a leaker by targeting the records of the potential source, and not the journalist, the Justice Department doesnt need to be involved.

## How to Break Open the Web: a report on the first Decentralized Web Summit

-  June's Decentralized Web Summit at San Francisco's Internet Archive was a ground-breaking, three-day combination of workshops, lectures, demos and a hackathon, all aimed at figuring out how to restore the decentralized character of the early internet -- and keep it that way.

-  In a long, thoughtful report on the event, Dan Gillmor and Kevin Marks write insightfully about the forces massed on both sides of this movement, and where it might all end up.

- Or we can look for ways to reclaim controldeclining to rely so much on centralized services, and using encryption and the new decentralized tools, such as the already-working IndieWeb, as they become available.

- If youve got a coding career on your mind, few programming disciplines will take you farther than a commanding knowledge of the Python language, which is not to be mistaken for parseltongue.

- New platforms, languages, and processes materialize all the time, so staying on top of all that innovation is a tall order.Whether youre brushing up on new tricks, starting from scratch, or just looking to make your own website a little jazzier, Rob Percivals new Complete Web Developer Course 2.0 (now [...] READ THE REST
