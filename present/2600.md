## In first, U.S. judge throws out cell phone 'stingray' evidence

- a federal judge has suppressed evidence obtained without a warrant by U.S. law enforcement using a stingray

- rights were violated when the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration used such a device without a warrant to find his Washington Heights apartment.

- The DEA had used a stingray to identify Lambis' apartment as the most likely location of a cell phone identified during a drug-trafficking probe.

- doing so constituted an unreasonable search.

## Edward Snowden's New Research Aims To Keep Smartphones From Betraying Their Owners

- But at the same time, as Intercept points out, they become especially potent tracking devices that can put users in mortal danger by leaking their location.

- "We have to ensure that journalists can investigate and find the truth, even in areas where governments prefer they don't," Snowden told Intercept.

- From the Intercept article: Snowden and Huang have been researching if it's possible to use a smartphone in such an offline manner without leaking its location, starting with the assumption that "a phone can and will be compromised."

- In other words, they want to build an entirely separate tiny computer that users can attach to a smartphone to alert them if it's being dishonest about its radio emissions.

- Plans are for the device to also be able to sound an audible alarm and possibly to also come equipped with a "kill switch" that can shut off power to the phone if any radio signals are detected.Wired has a  detailed report on this, too.

## Verizon To Disconnect Unlimited Data Customers Who Use Over 100GB/Month

-  Verizon To Disconnect Unlimited Data Customers Who Use Over 100GB/Month

- Verizon Wireless customers who have an unlimited data plan and use significantly more than 100GB a month will soon be disconnected from the network unless they agree to move to limited data packages that require payment of overage fees.

- Ars Technica reports: Verizon stopped offering unlimited data to new smartphone customers a few years ago, but some customers have been able to hang on to the old plans instead of switching to ones with monthly data limits.

- Verizon has tried to convert the holdouts by raising the price $20 a month and occasionally throttling heavy users but stopped that practice after net neutrality rules took effect.

- "These users are using data amounts well in excess of our largest plan size (100GB).

## Police 3D-Printed A Murder Victim's Finger To Unlock His Phone

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: Police in Michigan have a new tool for unlocking phones: 3D printing.

- According to a new report from Flash Forward creator Rose Eveleth, law enforcement officers approached professors at the University of Michigan earlier this year to reproduce a murder victim's fingerprint from a prerecorded scan.

- Because the investigation is ongoing, details are limited, and it's unclear whether the technique will be successful.

- Still, it's similar to techniques researchers have used in the past to re-create working fingerprint molds from scanned images, often in coordination with law enforcement.

- This may be the first confirmed case of police using the technique to unlock a phone in an active investigation. Apple has recently changed the way iOS manages fingerprint logins.

## 'The Hillary Leaks' - Wikileaks Releases 19,252 Previously Unseen DNC Emails

- Reader schwit1 writes: The state department's release of Hillary emails may be over, but that of Wikileaks is just starting.

- Moments ago, Julian Assange's whistleblower organization released over 19,000 emails and more than 8,000 attachments from the Democratic National Committee.

- This is part one of their new Hillary Leaks series, Wikileaks said in press release.:"Today, Friday 22 July 2016 at 10:30am EDT, WikiLeaks releases 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the top of the US Democratic National Committee -- part one of our new Hillary Leaks series.

- They purportedly come from the accounts of seven key DNC staffers: Andrew Wright, Jordon Kaplan, Scott Comer, Luis Miranda, Robert Stowe, Daniel Parrish and Allen Zachary.

- Many of the emails exchanged between top DNC officials are simply the text of news articles concerning how establishment democrats can "deal" with the insurgent left-winger. Update: 07/22 17:41 GMT by   :Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for the leak.

## BitCluster Brings a New Way to Snoop Through BitCoin Transactions

- If youre a thrifty person you might think you can get one wallet and use it for years. That might be true of the sweaty alligator-skin nightmare youve had in your back pocket for a decade now. Its not true when it comes to digital bits

- People who dont generate a new wallet for every transaction weaken their BitCoin anonymity and this weakness is the core of BitClusters approach.

- The uniqueness of that signed address can be tracked across those multiple transactions

- Both Ransomware and illicit markets can be observed using this technique

## Sources: Cyanogen Inc. is undergoing major layoffs, may "pivot" to apps

- According to one source, the systems and QA teams in Palo Alto and Seattle have been heavily cut, with Cyanogen's smaller offices in Lisbon and India reportedly being essentially gutted.

- Community support members were allegedly removed, too. We have been told by several sources that the company plans to undergo some sort of major strategic shift, with one claiming that this involves a "pivot" to "apps."

- Those who did show up were the unlucky ones: they had generic human resources meetings rather ominously added to their calendars last night.

## Glassdoor Exposes 600,000 Email Addresses

- web site where users anonymously review their employer has exposed the e-mail addresses -- and in some cases the names -- of hundreds of thousands of users

- On Friday, the company sent out an email announcing that it had changed its terms of service. Instead of blindly copying email recipients on the message, the company pasted their addresses in the clear. Each message recipient was able to see the email addresses of 999 other Glassdoor users...

## 9th Circuit: Its a crime to visit a website after being told not to visit it

- If Im reading it correctly, it says that if you tell people not to visit your website, and they do it anyway knowing you disapprove, theyre committing a federal crime of accessing your computer without authorization. I think this decision is wrong, and that it has big implications going forward.

- Power just changed IP addresses and continued operating. Facebook then sued, claiming that Powers conduct violated the CFAA, a somewhat similar California unauthorized access statute and the CAN-SPAM Act.

- We therefore hold that, after receiving written notification from Facebook on December 1, 2008, Power accessed Facebooks computers without authorization within the meaning of the CFAA and is liable under that statute. As I read the courts opinion, the main issue is state of mind.

- Similarly, for Power to continue its campaign using Facebooks computers, it needed authorization both from individual Facebook users (who controlled their data and personal pages) and from Facebook (which stored this data on its physical servers). I explained my problem with this kind of analogy in my recent article Norms of Computer Trespass. As I see it, the problem is that the trespass norms of private spaces like homes or commercial stores cant be blindly applied to a public website.

- I gather that as long as you phrase the notice as a command to cease and desist, rather than as just general terms of use, it becomes legally binding. One question is whether you can read the decision more narrowly to apply only to accessing an account rather than visiting a website.

## Software Flaw Puts Mobile Phones and Networks At Risk Of Complete Takeover - Slashdot

- Dan Goodin, reporting for Ars Technica: A newly disclosed vulnerability could allow attackers to seize control of mobile phones and key parts of the world's telecommunications infrastructure and make it possible to eavesdrop or disrupt entire networks, security experts warned Tuesday.

- The bug resides in a code library used in a wide range of telecommunication products, including radios in cell towers, routers, and switches, as well as the baseband chips in individual phones.

- Although exploiting the heap overflow vulnerability would require great skill and resources, attackers who managed to succeed would have the ability to execute malicious code on virtually all of those devices.

- The code library was developed by Pennsylvania-based Objective Systems and is used to implement a telephony standard known as ASN.1, short for Abstract Syntax Notation One."The vulnerability could be triggered remotely without any authentication in scenarios where the vulnerable code receives and processes ASN.1 encoded data from untrusted sources," researchers who discovered the flaw wrote in an advisory published Monday evening.

- "These may include communications between mobile devices and telecommunication network infrastructure nodes, communications between nodes in a carrier's network or across carrier boundaries, or communication between mutually untrusted endpoints in a data network.

## US standards lab says SMS is no good for authentication

- America's National Institute for Standards and Technology has advised abandonment of SMS-based two-factor authentication. That's the gist of the latest draft of its Digital Authentication Guideline, here.

- The change was first foreshadowed in May, with the agency now kicking off the first round of public comments for the document. For now, NIST says a service still using SMS verification needs to confirm that it's sending messages to a mobile number and not a VoIP service. The body also says users need better protection against having messages hijacked, for example by an attacker persuading the service provider that the number has changed: Changing the pre-registered telephone number SHALL NOT be possible without two-factor authentication at the time of the change, the document states [NIST's caps - Ed]. The guideline, officially Draft NIST Special Publication 800-63B, is a public preview.

- NIST says it's chosen that terminology, rather than its usual submission process, because it's let the body put the documents up on GitHub to gather preliminary responses. Were calling it a public preview because some of our agency partners (and NIST itself) have formal processes for public drafts.

- This lets us do things differently, NIST writes. The agency notes that the GitHub process won't replace public comment, but is instead additive to the existing open and transparent process ... We will maintain our tradition of extended public comment after this process comes to a close. During the GitHub comments process, NIST wants a focus on technical and procedural input rather than grammar or formatting discussions. The GitHub repo for the Digital Authentication Guidelines is here.

## Everything You Need To Know About Web Shells

- And various other mentions here and there. Now, Acunetix has come out with a great, really comprehensive 5 part article about web shells which covers:  Part 1  An introduction to web-shells Part 2  Web-shells 101 using PHP Part 3  Keeping web-shells under cover Part 4  Web-shells in action Part 5  Detection  Prevention  Which covers pretty much everything apart from the really advanced stuff, an introduction and then obviously PHP as its still the most widespread language for commonly installed CMS packages (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal etc), then hiding your web shells, what you can do with web shells and finishing with detecting and preventing the installation of web shells. A web-shell is a malicious script used by an attacker with the intent to escalate and maintain persistent access on an already compromised web application.

- The common functionality includes but is not limited to shell command execution, code execution, database enumeration and file management. From  Part 1 And the series to conclude: As we have seen, coding and using a web-shell is not difficult.

- Unfortunately, many web servers are setup in such a way where even a simple script is enough to cause significant damage.

- Some web-shells are very sophisticated and they are almost impossible to be detected, even with behavioral analysis. Having said this, early on in this article series, we had established that web-shells are post-exploitation tools.

- So yah, read all 5 parts and youll have to been to Web Shell starter school. Then go and explore this repo to find all kinds of web shells in different languages  https://github.com/tennc/webshell Enjoy!

## Yahoo Cuts $4.8B Deal to Sell Core Business to Verizon

- Including the severance, she will have received cash and stock compensation worth about $218 million during her time at Yahoo, according to Equilars calculations.Created by two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo was originally a hand-selected directory to the nascent World Wide Web, but it quickly expanded its ambitions.Yahoo is where you start, Jeff Mallett, the companys first chief operating officer, explained during a 1996 interview with a job candidate, Dan Finnigan.

- Mr. Finnigan, now the chief executive of Jobvite, said that he was skeptical of Yahoos quest to dominate every category of content, but he later joined the company to run its HotJobs division.Google, which emerged a few years later, used a superior, more automated approach to indexing the web.

- She acquired dozens of companies, including the blog network Tumblr. Although those initiatives bore little fruit, Yahoo had one major asset that kept investors placated.

- Jeffrey C. Smith, the chief of the hedge fund Starboard Value, began agitating for a sale of Yahoos core business, which would skirt the Alibaba tax issues.

- A version of this article appears in print on July 25, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Yahoo, a Star of the Early Web, Is Selling Its Business to Verizon.

## Nexus phones now identify suspected spam callers

- Today, were beginning to update your Google Phone app with spam protection on #Nexus and #AndroidOne devices to warn you about potential spam callers and give you the ability to block and report these numbers.

- If you already have Caller ID turned on, spam protection will be available on your phone once your app updates to the latest version.

- Call metadata for a specific phone need not be stored, just compared in real time.If you're using Caller ID in the Google Phone app, you're already sending the incoming number to Google for identification.

- But like... do your research when you make personal attacks on people's character because they said something you couldn't refute with facts.

- Go to your call logs, long press the number you want to block and it should be an option there?

## NIST Prepares To Ban SMS-Based Two-Factor Authentication

- An anonymous reader writes: "The U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) has released the latest draft version of the Digital Authentication Guideline that contains language hinting at a future ban of SMS-based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)," reports Softpedia.

- The guideline recommends the usage of tokens and software cryptographic authenticators instead.

- Even biometrics authentication is considered safe, under one condition: "Biometrics SHALL be used with another authentication factor (something you know or something you have)," the guideline's draft reads. The NIST DAG draft reads in part: "If the out of band verification is to be made using a SMS message on a public mobile telephone network, the verifier SHALL verify that the pre-registered telephone number being used is actually associated with a mobile network and not with a VoIP (or other software-based) service.

## Wikileaks Proves Primary Was Rigged: DNC Undermined Democracy

- We begin our series today with 20 thousand emails from the top of the DNC.

- Instead of treating Sanders as a viable candidate for the Democratic ticket, the DNC worked against him and his campaign to ensure Clinton received the nomination. One email from DNC Deputy Communications Director Eric Walker to several DNC staffers cites two news articles showing Sanders leading in Rhode Island and the limited number of polling locations in the state: If she outperforms this polling, the Bernie camp will go nuts and allege misconduct.

- Theyll probably complain regardless, actually. Instead of treating Sanders with impartiality, the DNC exhibits resentful disdain toward him and the thousands of disenfranchised voters he could have brought into the party. Wondering if theres a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess, wrote DNC Deputy Communications Director Mark Paustenbach to DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda, in response to backlash over DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz shutting off the Sanders campaigns access to voter database files. Another chain reveals MSNBCs Chuck Todd and DNC staff members discussing how to discredit MSNBCs Mika Brzezinskis call for Wasserman Schultz to resign. Most of the emails released come from seven prominent DNC staff members: senior adviser Andrew Wright, national finance director Jordon Kaplan, finance chief of staff Scott Comer, Northern California finance director Robert Stowe, finance director of data and strategic initiatives Daniel Parrish, finance director Allen Zachary and Miranda. The release provides further evidence the DNC broke its own charter violations by favoring Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee, long before any votes were cast. Over the past several weeks, Guccifer 2.0 released several internal memos showing DNC staff strategizing to make Clinton the presidential nomineeas early as March 2015.

- Regardless of the fundraising tactics, because both major campaigns didnt agree to use the joint fundraising committee super-PAC with the DNC, the DNC should have recused itself from participating with just the Clinton campaign. The Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0 leaks are the perfect end to a Democratic primary that undermined democracy at every possible opportunity while maintaining plausible deniability. The partys rules, including the use of super delegateswho disproportionately endorsed Clinton before the primaries beganare intended to provide the Democratic Party leverage over the election process.

- Heading into the Democratic National Convention, voters are beginning to understand that their voices are of little concern to the leadership. SEE ALSO: WERE STILL WAITING ON CLINTONS WALL STREET SPEECH TRANSCRIPTS

## Snowden designs device to warn when an iPhone is ratting out users

-  Mobile devices have without a doubt brought convenience to the masses, but that benefit comes at a high price for journalists, activists, and human rights workers who work in war-torn regions or other high-risk environments.

- Once built, the "field-ready" accessory would monitor various radio components inside the phone to confirm they're not transmitting data when a user has put the device into airplane mode.

- The hardware is designed to be independent from the mobile device, under the assumption that malware-infected smartphones are a fact of life in high-risk environments. Detecting intoxicated smartphones "Malware packages, peddled by hackers at a price accessible by private individuals, can activate radios without any indication from the user interface," Huang and Snowden wrote in a blog post published Thursday.

- Rather than monitor the nearfield communication function that enables Apple Pay, the pair decided to largely disable it by disconnecting its antenna under the assumption that it's not something journalists in conflict zones will need.

- Should attacks be developed that can exploit the much more limited NFC capabilities, the Introspection Engine could be updated to disable them altogether. The design was presented Thursday at the MIT Media Labs Forbidden Research event.

## Softbank to buy ARM Holdings for 24bn

- It's hard to exaggerate just how important ARM is to the UK tech sector - and the shock many are feeling this morning at the news that it is about to lose its independence.

- ARM Holdings is arguably the most precious jewel in the crown of British technology, its microchip designs are used in billions of devices.Sources close to the deal say the Japanese company considers ARM well placed to exploit the so called "internet of things" which may see microchips embedded in whole new categories of household and business devices.Prime Minister Theresa May recently questioned whether foreign takeovers of UK firms are always in the national interest.

- However, Softbank has committed to doubling the size of ARM's UK-based workforce over the next five years and new Chancellor Philip Hammond welcomed the deal.That allure has been boosted by the fall in the value of the pound since Brexit - making UK targets cheaper and many industry watchers are predicting a new wave of foreign takeovers.

- He was responsible for selling Pilkington, another blue chip UK company, to Nippon Sheet Glass in 2006.'Attractive destination'Prime Minister Theresa May said the deal between Softbank and ARM Holdings showed the UK economy could be successful after the country voted to leave the European Union.A spokeswoman for the prime minister said Mrs May believed the deal was in the country's national interest - a gauge that she will use to assess any future foreign takeovers.

- Dan Ridsdale, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said "An increase in inbound merger and acquisition activity was one of the obvious consequences of Brexit and weakened sterling, but few expected it to manifest itself so quickly or at so large a scale.

## WikiLeaks fights The Man by, er, publishing ordinary people's personal information

- WikiLeaks prides itself on taking on The Man by finding and publishing information that the world's most powerful organizations want to keep hidden. Unfortunately, on Friday, WikiLeaks took a swing at The Man by standing on the heads of thousands of innocent citizens whose personal details it has published, including their names, home addresses, phone numbers, and even credit card, social security and passport numbers.  

- Just to make it even easier for identity thieves, the veritable goldmine of personal information is provided online in plain text and is even searchable. The records are included in nearly 20,000 emails sent by senior operatives in the Democratic National Committee's campaign and communications department between January and May of this year.

- None of these should surprise you. A significant chunk of the files are simply mailing list-style emails providing news highlights, or calendar items for long-past events. If anything, the release shows that the people whose accounts were compromised, including communications director Luis Miranda, national finance director Jordon Kaplan and finance chief of staff Scott Comer, are very careful about not sharing confidential information over email. And then Unfortunately, the database theft also scooped up automated messages sent through the Democrats.org signup and contribution page.

- Those emails provide the personal details of people who have contributed to the campaign  even if it was just $5. It is regrettable that this sensitive information was stored in plain text in such a way that, by one means or another, it could be obtained by WikiLeaks.

- That is something Democrat officials will have to explain. That aside, far from exposing the corruption of high politics  which, presumably, is what WikiLeaks intends  its data dump has put ordinary citizens at the very real risk of having their identities stolen. By simply searching on obvious keywords like "contribution" or "passport" or "SSN," it is possible to instantly track down a wealth of information on over a thousand individuals. Perhaps in the world of WikiLeaks boss Julian Assange, anyone who contributes to a political party is by definition a part of the vast global conspiracy and deserves to be exposed to the kind of risks to their financial well-being that those unlucky souls will now almost certainly experience. But for everyone else, it looks as though WikiLeaks has been grossly irresponsible and, frankly, idiotic, not to screen, review or filter this information before publishing.

## Feds Seize KickassTorrents Domains and Arrest Owner In Poland

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Federal authorities announced on Wednesday the arrest of the alleged mastermind of KickassTorrents (KAT), the world's largest BitTorrent distribution site.

- According to a Department of Justice press release sent to Ars Technica, Vaulin was arrested on Wednesday in Poland.

- "Vaulin is charged with running today's most visited illegal file-sharing website, responsible for unlawfully distributing well over $1 billion of copyrighted materials," Assistant Attorney General Caldwell said in the statement.

- "In an effort to evade law enforcement, Vaulin allegedly relied on servers located in countries around the world and moved his domains due to repeated seizures and civil lawsuits.

- " KickassTorrents added a dark web address last month to make it easier for users to bypass blockades installed by ISPs.

## A Quick, Simple Guide to Tor and the Internet of Things (So Far)

-  "The Internet of Things" is the remote control and networking of everyday devices ranging from a family's lawn sprinkler or babycam to a corporation's entire HVAC system. Tor Project contributor  Nathan Freitas, Executive Director of The Guardian Project, has developed a new way to use Tor's anonymous onion services to protect the "Internet of Things."

-  The system uses Home Assistant, a free, open-source platform built on Python, that can run on Raspberry Pi and other devices.

- It easily can be set up to control and network peoples Internet of Things home security systems, toasters, thermostats, smart lightbulbs, weather sensors and other household appliances.

- Instead of a hackable, single point of failure, attackers must contend with the global network of  thousands of Tor nodes. "Too many 'Things' in our homes, at our hospitals, in our businesses and throughout our lives are exposed to the public Internet without the ability to protect their communication.

- Tor provides this, for free, with real-world hard ended, open-source software and strong, state of the art cryptography," said Nathan Freitas, Executive Director of the Guardian Project. Networked sensors and the Internet of Things are projected to grow substantially, and this has the potential to drastically change surveillance.

## Intel's SGX tiptoes towards Linux

- Intel has fulfilled a promise made in April to open-source a Linux driver for its SGX technology. SGX  Software Guard Extensions  first landed in 2013, and allows programmers to lock up code and data inside containers enforced by the CPU.

- Back in April, Chipzilla promised an SGX SDK for Linux, and a few weeks ago  with so little fuss we overlooked it  it made good over at GitHub. The current implementation is very Alpha-looking, with just one distribution anointed to run SGX  Ubuntu 14.04-LTS 64bits.

- Intel notes that the driver isn't yet incorporated into the Linux main tree. SGX is designed to get around the problem that any encrypted data has to be decrypted at some point, so programs can operate on it (homomorphic encryption gets around this, but at a huge performance hit).

- With SGX running, data and runtime code are put in 'enclaves' that are invisible even to processors with root-level privilege. It's not perfect  in February, MIT's Victor Costan and Srinivas Devadas pulled apart how SGX obtains its certificates. There's also been criticism (for example the discussion starting here at the Linux Kernel Mailing List about its status in the kernel), but perhaps with the code under GPL 2, perhaps developers will feel more comfortable with it.

## Tor veteran Lucky Green exits, torpedos critical 'Tonga' node and relays

- Bridge Authorities are part of the infrastructure that lets users get around some ISP-level blocks on the network (not, however, defeating deep packet inspection).

- They're also incorporated in the Tor code, meaning that to remove a Bridge Authority is going to need an update. The shutdown is to take place on August 31. Lucky Green's message to the community reads as follows:  Given recent events, it is no longer appropriate for me to materially contribute to the Tor Project either financially, as I have so generously throughout the years, nor by providing computing resources.

- Nonetheless, I feel that I have no reasonable choice left within the bounds of ethics, but to announce the discontinuation of all Tor-related services hosted on every system under my control.

- Most notably, this includes the Tor node "Tonga", the "Bridge Authority", which I recognize is rather pivotal to the network

- In addition to Tonga, I will shut down a number of fast Tor relays, but the directory authorities should detect that shutdown quickly and no separate notice is needed here.

-   A former NASA intern uploaded the thousands of lines of assembly code to GitHub, working from a 2003 transcription made from scans inherited by MIT from a Colorado airplane pilot, and developers are already using GitHub to submit funny issue tickets for the 40-year-old code -- for example, "".

## Infected Pokemon GO APK Carries Dangerous Android Backdoor

-  Infected Pokemon GO APK Carries Dangerous Android Backdoor

- An anonymous reader writes: Users eager to get their hands on the new Nintendo mobile gaming app Pokemon GO, downloading unofficial copies of the game are opening themselves up to hackers who are circulating malicious versions of the Android APK.

- A remote access tool (RAT), known as DroidJack (or SandroRAT), has been added to some APK files, allowing third parties to gain full control over the users' mobile devices.

- Permissions granted to the dodgy app include; directly calling phone numbers, reading phone status' and identities, editing and reading text messages, sending SMS messages and recording audio.The problem is that Pokemon Go is not officially available in every region, and the Google PlayStore doesn't let people in an unsupported region download the app.

- While we do not condone downloading installation files of Android apps and games from unofficial stores, APKMirror is one of the few places that we would suggest our readers to check as it has a very commendable track record.

## PSA: Pokemon Go Has Full Access To Your Google Account Data

- It can read your email, location history, documents and pretty much every else associated with your Google account.

- Given the nature of the game, it's understandable for it to request a lot of permissions, as it needs your precise location, ability to access the camera and motion sensors, read and write the SD card, and charge you money when you run out of Pokeballs or eggs.

- But full access to your Google account is pushing it, even if Niantic or Nintendo has no malicious intentions.

- If you're concerned about these permissions, you can always sign-up using a Pokemon Trainer account, assuming the servers are permitting. Google describes full account access as such: "When you grant full account access, the application can see and modify nearly all information in your Google Account (but it cana(TM)t change your password, delete your account, or pay with Google Wallet on your behalf).

- This 'Full account access' privilege should only be granted to applications you fully trust, and which are installed on your personal computer, phone, or tablet.

## CloudFlare, We Have a Problem

- Back in 2011, when I ran AnonNews.org, I had to cope with frequent DDoS attacks - not all that surprising, given that it was a very popular news site and community for Anonymous, which was seeing the peak of its media coverage at the time.

- You can't protect the rest of your infrastructure (mailservers, chat servers, gameservers, and so on), and even for your web-based services, CloudFlare will kick you off the Free and Pro plans if you get attacked too much and they can figure out that you are the target.

- I'm involved in ArchiveTeam, essentially a loose collective of archivists that try to preserve culture and knowledge on an ever-rotting web - the rotting usually being a result of service providers throwing away user data on 2 weeks notice because it's no longer profitable to them, not really caring about the consequences for the users.

- This is not really surprising, given the mess of peering agreements in Asia; using CloudFlare just means you're adding an additional hop to go through, which increases the risk of ending up on a strange and slow route.

- And this is the problem with CloudFlare in general - you can't usually make things faster by routing connections through somewhere, because you're adding an extra location for the traffic to travel to, before reaching the origin server.

## Why do Pokemon avoid black neighborhoods?

-  The crowdsourced database that was use to seed locations to catch Pokemon in Pokemon Go came from early augmented reality games that were played by overwhelmingly affluent (and thus, disproportionately white) people, who, in an increasingly racially segregated America, are less and less likely to venture into black neighborhoods, meaning that fewer Pokemon-catching landmarks have been tagged there.

-  This wasn't as glaring a problem while the landmark database was being used with Ingress, Pokemon Go's predecessor, because the players were affluent (and this overwhelmingly white).

- Now that Pokemon Go has given AR its breakthrough moment and a more diverse player-base, the sampling bias in the creation of its underlying database is unmissable.

-   A 2015 Pew poll shows that gaming crosses demographic lines among young people.

-  Network effects, which can reinforce racial segregation, were a major force behind the spread of Ingress; some 11 percent of players received their access codes from friends.

## Fake Pokemon Go app on Google Play infects phones with screenlocker

- Still, it continues to run in the background and surreptitiously clicks on ads in an attempt to generate revenue for its creators. "This is the first observation of lockscreen functionality being successfully used in a fake app that has landed on Google Play," Eset malware researcher Lukas Stefanko wrote in Friday's post.

- "It is important to note that from there it takes just one small step to add a ransom message and create the first lockscreen ransomware on Google Play.

- " Eset discovered two other fake Pokemon Go apps inhabiting Google Play, one named "Guide  Cheats for Pokemon Go" and the other "Install Pokemongo."

- Last week, researchers from security firm Proofpoint discovered a backdoored version of the Pokemon Go app for Android.

- The continued presence of malicious apps inside the official Android marketplace underscores the significant limits of Google's attempts to detect malicious or abusive behavior before admitting titles. People who want to run Pokemon Go on their Android phone should download the app only from Google Play, and even then, they should closely inspect the publisher, the number of downloads, and other data for signs of fraud before installing.

## Bitcoin Price Climbs Over 50% in First Half of 2016

- Chinese exchanges OKCoin and Huobi continued to dominate trading activity, as they accounted for more than 93% of all transactions. Market sentiment was bullish during the period, as figures provided by full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub show that 66% of positions were long. Past that, confidence, meaning the percentage by which a particular days position sizes were larger than average, was 74% during the six-month time frame. Ether rising Bitcoin was not the only digital currency that enjoyed notable gains. Ether, the digital asset on the ethereum platform, surged from $0.92 on 1st January to $12.42 on 30th June, a gain of roughly 1,250%, Poloniex figures reveal. The digital currency, which has seen less adoption than bitcoin but seems to be quickly making progress, rose to an all-time high of $21.40 at 05:00 UTC on 17th June, but fell more than 50% to $10.00 by 16:00 UTC the next day. Ethers price benefited greatly near the beginning of the year with the release of Homestead, the first "production version" of the platform, Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin leveraged trading platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk. The digital currency enjoyed tailwinds as a result of the ethereum development team delivering a working protocol.

- While it took bitcoin a total of six years to hit the milestone of 100 million transactions, the digital currency reached 140 million transactions during the first half of 2016, Lee stated. Past that, he described rising price stability as "a reflection of greater adoption". Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, added further insight, emphasizing that while bitcoin was more esoteric when it first came into existence, it has been making inroads into the mainstream.

- The digital currency is receiving "more and more publicity," he stated. Still, this sentiment is not without its challengers. Tim Swanson, director of research for banking consortium R3, for example, has taken issue with the opaque nature of adoption numbers in the industry, and overall lack of visibility on key metrics. External influences One development that may have fueled the rising adoption of bitcoin is concerns about yuan devaluation. The Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) sharply devalued the Chinese yuan in August 2015.

- This move triggered bitcoins breakout, said Hayes, as the central bank kept reducing the value of Chinas currency over the next 10 months. Bitcoin benefited from fears of Chinese savers that their purchasing power would drastically decrease, he stated.

- Hayes added that the PBOC began closing the easy ways through which capital leaves China. Another variable that analysts singled out as helping push bitcoin prices higher was the Brexit, when on 23rd June, British voters approved the UKs departure from the 28-nation European Union. While more than one expert has pointed to this event as affecting bitcoin prices, Enneking said that it had less of an effect than past macroeconomic events. For instance, he indicated that events in Greece in 2015 and China in 2013 "paled in comparison" to price moves observed as a result of the Brexit. The halving In addition to yuan devaluation and the Brexit, one event that generated significant visibility during the first half of 2016 was the halving. Bitcoin miners compete to create blocks in the blockchain by verifying transactions, and every time a miner generates one of these blocks, it receives a reward.

## A Bit on Certificate Transparency Gossip

- The point of CT Gossip is to detect Certificate Transparency logs that have misbehaved (either accidentally, maliciously, or by having been compromised.)

- O is chosen to be a disk space size large enough that client developers or server operators are scared off of deploying Gossip.

- For example, sustaining a BGP hijack of Twitter or Facebook's routes for more than a short period of time would be both noticeable and potentially damaging politically.

- So here's what to do with this math: I can use this method to figure out what the probability of sending an item will need to be, to defend against an attacker using the definition of winning we define above.

- In the future, it may be possible for servers to supply SCTs with Inclusion Proofs to recent STHs; this would allow clients to discard data more aggressively.

## draft-ietf-trans-gossip-03

- The logs in Certificate Transparency are untrusted in the sense that
   the users of the system don't have to trust that they behave
   correctly since the behavior of a log can be verified to be correct.

- This document tries to solve the problem with logs presenting a
   "split view" of their operations.  It describes three gossiping
   mechanisms for Certificate Transparency: SCT Feedback, STH
   Pollination and Trusted Auditor Relationship.

## Why OnionScan Should Worry You

- the mission of OnionScan is to find out information about anonymous communities.

- We don't set up malicious hidden services directories to harvest new addresses.

- We don't exploit vulnerabilities in the services we scan

- We don't store the information we find

- OnionScan has been able to demonstrate consistent failings in security in a large number of onion services.

## Meet Riffle, the next-gen anonymity network that hopes to trounce Tor

- snoop-proof and faster and more reliable against attack than Tor

- Each node can mathematically prove that data passing through it hasn't been meddled with

- each Riffle client sends an initial message to all nodes in the mesh simultaneously to establish that mathematical proof

- if just one of the computers routing a Riffle connection remains uncompromised, that one machine will detect when the mathematical proof has been broken

- Riffle uses a technique called a verifiable shuffle. Because of the onion encryption, the messages that each server forwards look nothing like the ones it receives,

- with Riffle, users send their initial messages to not just the first server in the mixnet but all of them, simultaneously

- PS: A Tor core developer claims to have already broken Riffle.

## Password Sharing Is Now a Crime

- At issue is language in the CFAA that makes it illegal to access a computer system "without authorization."

- For you and me, this case means that unless Netflix specifically authorizes you to share your password with your friend, you're breaking federal law.

- While the majority opinion said that the facts of this case "bear little resemblance" to the kind of password sharing that people often do, Judge Reinhardt's dissent notes that it fails to provide an explanation of why that is.

- Using an analogy in which a woman uses her husband's user credentials to access his bank account to pay bills, Judge Reinhardt noted: "So long as the wife knows that the bank does not give her permission to access its servers in any manner, she is in the same position as Nosal and his associates."

- As a result, although the majority says otherwise, the court turned anyone who has ever used someone else's password without the approval of the computer owner into a potential felon.

## iOS version of Pokemon Go is a possible privacy trainwreck [Updated]

-   If you sign in to Pokemon Go on iOS, you may be giving it more access than it needs.

-  Update: Niantic has confirmed in a statement that the Pokemon Go app requests more permissions than it needs but that it has not accessed any user information.

- Once we became aware of this error, we began working on a client-side fix to request permission for only basic Google account information, in line with the data we actually access.

- You can check on and revoke permissions for Pokemon Go and any other external app on this page. We've independently verified that the game requests full account access on iOS, but the Android version doesn't appear to have the same problem; you can sign in with Google, but the app doesn't show up on the permissions page.

- Andrew Cunningham It's very likely that this is an oversight or an error rather than an intentional, malicious move on Niantic's part, but we've contacted the company for more information and will update the article if we receive a response.

## Researchers Discover Tor Nodes Designed to Spy on Hidden Services

- Researchers Discover Tor Nodes Designed to Spy on Hidden Services

- These nodes then attacked the hidden services by making connections to them and trying common exploits against the server-software running on them, seeking to compromise and take them over.

- The researchers used "honeypot" .onion servers to find the spying computers: these honeypots were .onion sites that the researchers set up in their own lab and then connected to repeatedly over the Tor network, thus seeding many Tor nodes with the information of the honions' existence.

- This attack was already understood as a theoretical problem for the Tor project, which had recently undertaken a rearchitecting of the hidden service system that would prevent it from taking place.

- No one knows who is running the spying nodes: they could be run by criminals, governments, private suppliers of "infowar" weapons to governments, independent researchers, or other scholars (though scholarly research would not normally include attempts to hack the servers once they were discovered).

## 20-year-old Windows bug lets printers install malwarepatch now

- The failure makes it possible for attackers to use several different techniques that deliver maliciously modified drivers instead of the legitimate one provided by the printer maker.

- This situation comes to life because we end up delegating the responsibility of holding the driver safely to the printer, and those devices might not be as secure or impregnable as one would hope.

- In an advisory accompanying Tuesday's patch Microsoft rated the code-execution vulnerability critical for all supported Windows versions.

- Vectra said the vulnerability dates back to Windows 95. A word of caution to those concerned about this vulnerability: Moore said Tuesday's update doesn't close the code-execution hole, but rather it merely adds a warning as part of the update. "Knowing how most users respond to warnings, this doesn't seem like an effective approach," he said. On the brighter side, code-execution attacks won't work in enterprise settings that use Microsoft's Active Directory unless administrators have modified default settings.

- "Convincing someone to add a printer might be tricky, but there may be other ways to drive that behavior through other network attacks, such as by hijacking HTTP requests and telling the user to do so.

- Some Turkish users were able to update their social media accounts likely through a VPN or other anonymizing service.

- One user posted a video on Twitter that shows what appears to be a fighter jet flying very low over the Turkish capital of Ankara; another user has tweeted a video of a helicopter opening fire in Turkey.

- The Associated Press reports that Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, has confirmed the coup by a group within Turkey's military. The following statement from the group was reportedly read on local television: "Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and the general security that was damaged.

-   UPDATE 7/15/16: Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued a statement in a FaceTime call to CNN Turk urging Turkish citizens to take to the streets to defend "Turkish democracy."

## Why Bitcoin's Halving Was a Boring Vindication

- When the last bitcoin is released in 2140, there will be a total of 21m total bitcoin in the market, though many will not be in circulation due to loss. Heading into the event, there were predictions on what would happen, with some speculating that the price would drop immediately after to others suggesting worst-case scenarios. But what has become clear, at least in the first week after halving, is that halving was just another day for bitcoin. Price unaffected One of the primary expectations leading up to halving was that the price would drop due to an expected rumor-and-event cycle, whereby traders would accumulate the asset, riding the excitement up until the actual halving took place, at which point they would exit positions. Petar Zivkovski, the director of operations at WhaleClub, for example, predicted that the smart money  institutions, professional traders, and other knowledgeable bitcoin traders  would sell their bitcoin holdings at the event. The day before halving, the price of bitcoin dropped by close to 10%, from $674 to $618, according to CoinDesks USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

- If the price continues to stay relatively constant after halving, with the number dropped to 12.5 BTC, miners were either not selling all of their coins when they were receiving 25 BTC, or the smart money is selling, offsetting the cut in new supply. A similar behavior occurred when bitcoin last halved on 28th November, 2012, when the price was $12.35.

- The price increased by approximately a $1 over the next month, a relative calm despite the predictable nature of the approaching halving.

- Only a few minutes later, when F2Pool sealed the 420,000th block, it earned 12.5 BTC, valued at approximately $8,125. Miners effectively saw their revenue cut in half, which was to be expected.

- And while it did drop, from 1,600 petahash/second to a little under 1,400 petahash/second, this is well within the fluctuation of hashing power over the past few months. Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, told CoinDesk that efficiency is what matters for bitcoin mining. He explained: "For us, the halving didn't surprise us at all.

## 15-year-old security hole HTTPoxy returns to menace websites  it has a name, logo too

- If you're running PHP or CGI, you should block the Proxy header now,

- The Apache Software Foundation, Red Hat, Ngnix and others have rushed to warn programmers of the so-called httpoxy flaw,

- Basically, you abuse the Proxy HTTP header in a request to the application to set a common environment variable called HTTP_PROXY on the application's server. The app then, due to a naming conflict, uses the proxy server defined by that variable for any of its outgoing HTTP connections.

- potentially gain remote code execution.

## OpenSSH has user enumeration bug

- A bug in OpenSSH allows an attacker to check whether user names are valid on a 'net-facing server - because the Blowfish algorithm runs faster than SHA256/SHA512.

- If you send a user ID to an OpenSSH server with a long (but wrong) password  10 kilobytes is what Harari mentions in his post  then the server will respond quickly for fake users, but slower for real users.

## How Bitcoin's Second Halving Came and Went, and Not Much Happened

- Asked by Bitcoin Magazine, BitFury acknowledged it has not switched off any mining gear, and supposedly is just having a slight unlucky streak.

- (Daniel Masters, who runs a New Jersey-based Bitcoin hedge fund, isreported to have bought a part of KnCMiner's business, which may explain why the pool seems to still mine blocks.

- The resulting drop in hash rate, and subsequent slowdown of block creation, could cause the network to become congested, they warned.

- In a worst-case scenario, they worried, this could even lead to downward spiral of decreased usability, a falling exchange rate, and, therefore, even more miners shutting down.Another described threat concerned an increased risk of a 51 percent attack.

- This would open up the possibility of miners blocking or even reversing transactions.Of course, since neither hash rate (nor price) dropped much at all, the downward spiral-scenario did not play out at all.

## How I made LastPass give me all your passwords

-  Note: This issue has already been resolved and pushed to the Lastpass users.   Stealing all your passwords by just visiting a webpage.

- Thats what I thought too before I decided to check out the security of the LastPass browser extension.   For those who dont know, LastPass is one of the worlds most popular password managers.   I started by noticing that the extension added some HTML code to every page I visited, so I decided to dig into how that worked.

- Since the code only URL encodes the last occurence of @, the actual domain is treated as the username portion of the URL. Too bad to be true? Below you see that the extension would fill my form with the stored credentials for twitter.com.

- After that I could simply go through other commonly used sites and extract credentials for those too.      I reported this to LastPass through their responsible disclosure page and the report was handled very professionally.

- They are still much better than the alternative (password reuse).   Although, taking a second to disable autofill functionality is a good move because this isnt the first autofill bug weve seen, and I doubt it will be the last.   Also, this would not work if multi factor authentication was on, so you should probably enable that as well. Updates Update #1 2016.07.28: There has been a lot of comments regarding the reward Mathias received from Lastpass.

## Malicious computers caught snooping on Tor-anonymized Dark Web sites

- Both SQL and XSS exploits can reveal a wealth of sensitive information on servers containing administration or configuration errors or vulnerabilities that aren't publicly known.

- Professor Noubir presented his findings on Friday at the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium in Germany along with Amirali Sanatinia, a PhD student who also participated in the research. The research is only the latest indication that Tor can't automatically guarantee the anonymity of hidden services or the people visiting them.

- In a paper accompanying Friday's presentation, the researchers from Northeastern wrote: Most of the visits were just querying the root path of the server and were automated.

- For example, we had queries for description.json, which is a proposal to all HTTP servers inside Tor network to allow hidden services search engines such as Ahmia, to index websites.

- Additionally, we detected other attack vectors, such as SQL injection, targeting the information_schema.tables, username enumeration in Drupal, cross-site scripting (XSS), path traversal (looking for boot.ini and /etc/passwd), targeting Ruby on Rails framework (rails/info/properties), and PHP Easter Eggs (?=PHP*-*-*-*-*). The paper also contains a detailed description of the way the researchers deployed their network of honions. "The Tor Project people are aware of this problem and have been working on resolving it," Noubir told Ars.

## Show HN: Accelerating SHA256 by 100x in Golang on ARM

- To be fair, the default implementation for Go on ARM is not accelerated in any way (unlike for instance for Intel CPUs where there is an assembly version).

- If it had been in assembly the difference would be quite a bit smaller, but in our view still minimally a factor 10x due to the new sha256h, sha256h2, sha256su0, and sha256su1 instructions.As you can maybe derive from the name of the minio/sha256-simd repo, yes, we are working on adding SIMD (AVX2, AVX and SSE flavors) support for SHA256 on Intel, so stay tuned for that.

- Linux 4.4 has added support for this but so far we have not been able to identify any CPUs that will actually run this code.

- If you do, please let us know and with wider support we would actually be interested in adding this to minio/sha256-simd.Finishing off, the asm2plan9s tool that we initially developed to assist in minio/blake2b-simd is being extended with ARM support (in addition to Intel that is already available).And sharp readers may have noticed that there is one more interesting feature for ARMv8 which is PMULL (polynomial multiplication).

- We use this technique at Minio for the XL version to guarantee additional safety and protection against bit rot.

- It wasnt long before nearly all the keys were made available for 3D printing and, last week, security researchers released the final key. At last weeks HOPE Conference in New York, hackers calling themselves DarkSim905, Johnny Xmas, and Nite 0wl explained how  and why  they cracked the TSA keys. This was done by legally procuring actual locks, comparing the inner workings, and finding the common denominator.

- What were doing here is literally cracking physical encryption, and I fear that metaphor isnt going to be properly delivered to the public. The keys, should you be interested, are here and can be printed on a 3D printer. The TSA, for their part, doesnt care, telling The Intercept that The reported ability to create keys for TSA-approved suitcase locks from a digital image does not create a threat to aviation security.

- These consumer products are peace of mind devices, not part of TSAs aviation security regime. In other words, you might as well not use locks at all.

## Bunnie and Snowden Explore IPhones Hackability

-  [Bunnie Huang] and [Edward Snowden] have teamed up to publish a paper exploring the possibility of introspection on the iPhone. A rendering of the proposed introspection device attached to an iPhone6 The idea is that phones are increasingly complex and potentially vulnerable to all kinds of digital surveillance.

- Even airplane mode is insufficient for knowing that your phone isnt somehow transmitting information.

- The paper looks at the various radios on the iPhone, going so far as opening up the device and reading signals at each of the chips for cell, WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, and NFC to determine whether the chip itself is doing anything, regardless of what the screen says.

- This introspection can then be used to be confident that the phone is not communicating when it shouldnt be. The paper goes on to propose a device that they will prototype in the coming year which uses an FPC that goes into the phone through the SIM card port.

- It would contain a battery, display, buttons, multiple SIM cards, and an FPGA to monitor the various buses and chips and report on activity. Significant hacking of an iPhone will still be required, but the idea is to increase transparency and be certain that your device is only doing what you want it to.

## Tor inquiry: Many people reported being humiliated by Appelbaum

-  The Tor Project said Wednesday that its internal investigation has been completed into allegations of sexual misconduct allegedly perpetrated by one of its most prominent staffers, who has since left the organization. In a statement, Executive Director Shari Steele wrote that the inquiry concluded that "many people inside and outside the Tor Project have reported incidents of being humiliated, intimidated, bullied, and frightened" by Jacob Appelbaum, a now-ex-member of Tors "Core Team," adding, "and several experienced unwanted sexually aggressive behavior from him.

- " The Tor Project is the Massachusetts-based nonprofit that maintains Tor, the well-known open source online anonymity tool. Steele added, "The investigation also identified two additional people as having engaged in inappropriate conduct, and they are no longer involved with the Tor Project.

- " Kate Krauss, the group's spokeswoman, declined to tell Ars who those people are. In June 2016, Appelbaum, one of Tors most public-facing developers, denounced the accusations, calling them a "calculated and targeted attack has been launched to spread vicious and spurious allegations against me.

- " "I want to be clear: the accusations of criminal sexual misconduct against me are entirely false," he wrote on Twitter at the time.

- He has not posted on Twitter since June 6, 2016. Earlier this month, the Tor Project announced an entire revamp of its board of directors, replacing the leadership with more tech and privacy-minded people than before. Steele also wrote Wednesday that the Tor Project has now created a "anti-harassment policy, a conflicts of interest policy, procedures for submitting complaints, and an internal complaint review process" in response to the Appelbaum fiasco.

## ThreatConnect Follows Guccifer 2.0 to Russian VPN Service

- We quickly found more evidence to support our previous research that Guccifer 2.0 maintains Russian origins.  In the figure above, the current domain resolution for vpn-service[.

- All of the Elite VPN Service nodes offered in their web interface and the IP address used by Guccifer 2.0 to communicate via email returned the same SSH fingerprint.

- This raises our confidence in our assessment that using the Elite VPN service is a practice that the actors behind Guccifer 2.0 leverage in an effort to hide their true identities.

- ]34 VPN IP is exclusively used by the individuals or organization behind Guccifer 2.0, there are some significant leads  phone numbers, websites, and previous malicious activity  that may help us identify more information about those actors.

- Finally, as the actors behind Guccifer 2.0 continue to develop the persona, we would expect to see the their OPSEC practices similarly develop to reduce the amount of visibility we can gain into their operations.

## In 2016 Your Wireless Keyboard Security Still SUCKS  KeySniffer

- And youd be wrong  two-thirds of wireless keyboards, from MAJOR manufacturers are not even vaguely secure.  It turns out, in 2016 when cryptography is mainstream, open-source and fairly easy to implement with proven libraries for every language  wireless keyboards still communicate in plain text. Millions of low-cost wireless keyboards are susceptible to a vulnerability that reveals private data to hackers in clear text. The vulnerability  dubbed KeySniffer  creates a means for hackers to remotely sniff all the keystrokes of wireless keyboards from eight manufacturers from distances up to 100 metres away. When we purchase a wireless keyboard we reasonably expect that the manufacturer has designed and built security into the core of the product, said Bastille Research Team member Marc Newlin, responsible for the KeySniffer discovery.

- In 2010, the KeyKeriki team exposed weak XOR encryption in certain Microsoft wireless keyboards.

- Both of those took advantage of shortcomings in Microsofts encryption. The KeySniffer discovery is different in that it reveals that manufacturers are actually producing and selling wireless keyboards with no encryption at all.

- Bluetooth keyboards and higher-end wireless keyboards from manufacturers including Logitech, Dell, and Lenovo are not susceptible to KeySniffer. Bastille notified affected vendors to provide them the opportunity to address the KeySniffer vulnerability prior to going public on Tuesday.

- Unless you have a HTPC or home-media center, you probably have an el-cheapo wireless keyboard on that. But youre also not typing sensitive information on it (apart from your Netflix login) so it doesnt really matter. Source: The Register

## British Spies Used a URL Shortener to Honeypot Arab Spring Dissidents

-  Illustration: Shaye Anderson A shadowy unit of the British intelligence agency GCHQ tried to influence online activists during the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests and the 2011 democratic uprisings largely known as the Arab Spring, as new evidence gathered from documents leaked by Edward Snowden shows.

- I was able to uncover it because I was myself targeted in the pastThe project is linked to the GCHQ unit called the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group or JTRIG, whose mission is to use "dirty tricks" to destroy, deny, degrade [and] disrupt enemies by discrediting them, according to leaked documents.

- According to agency documents published by The Intercept, one of the strategies for measuring the effectiveness of an operation is to check online to see if a message has been understood accepted, remembered and changed behaviour.

- I suppose anything could happen at this point.  Screenshot from whyweprotest.net. A TANGLED WEB  The URL shortener had no new activity on Twitter in 2010, and was next seen in 2011 predominantly by an account tweeting about Syria during the Arab Spring called access4syria.

- GCHQ, when asked to comment on whether it created the uncovered accounts and lurl.me, and what procedures and policies were in place to ensure oversight of undercover activity carried out by JTRIG, the agency provided its boiler-plate response.

## Google Play Rolls Out Family Sharing

- Google on Wednesday announced a new Google Play feature dubbed Family Library that allows up to 6 people to share apps, movies, books purchases

- The feature will allow users to share apps, games, movies, TV shows or books from Google Play on Android devices. Movies, TV shows and books can be shared on iOS platforms and the Web. After a user signs up for the Family Library, the person adds up to five family members and decides on the credit card that will be used for the families purchases

- The feature is strikingly similar to an option in Apple's App Store that does the same thing.

## Docker Built-In Orchestration Ready for Production: Docker 1.12 Goes GA

- Docker 1.12 adds the largest and most sophisticated set of features into a single release since the beginning of the Docker project

- A swarm is a decentralized and highly available group of Docker nodes. Each node is a self-contained orchestration subsystem that has all the inherent capabilities needed to create a pool of common resources to schedule Dockerized services

- enabling the operator to choose which nodes are managers and which are workers

- In production environments, we strongly recommend having nodes designated as either managers or workers

- one of swarm modes security advances is that worker nodes do not have access to information in the datastore or the Service API.

- Manager to Manager Communication: Always Available Quorums

## Protocol Buffers v3.0.0 released

- The main intent of introducing proto3 is to clean up protobuf before pushing the language as the foundation of Google's new API platform.

- message TestMessage { reserved "foo", "bar"; }   Added a deterministic serialization API (currently available in C++).

- The deterministic serialization is, however, NOT canonical across languages; it is also unstable across different builds with schema changes due to unknown fields.

- persistent storage in a canonical form, fingerprinting, etc, should define their own canonicalization specification and implement the serializer using reflection APIs rather than relying on this API. Added a new field option "json_name".

- Annotated APIs are experimental and are subject to change in a backward incompatible way in future releases. Introduced zero-copy serialization as an ExperimentalApi

## Yet another Android side channel: input stealing for fun and profit

- We found that software on your smartphone can infer words you type in other apps by monitoring the aggregate number of context switches and the number of hardware interrupts.

- These are readable by permissionless apps within the virtual procfs filesystem (mounted under /proc).

- a curious app can monitor these global files as a user types on the phone and try to work out the words

- We looked at smartphone keyboards that support gesture typing

- Google should simply disable access to all procfs files, rather than just the files that leak information about individual apps. Meanwhile, if youre developing apps for privacy or anonymity, you should be aware that these risks exist.

## Data of 200 Million Yahoo Users Pops Up for Sale on the Dark Web

- In total, this hacker sold the personal details of over 800 million users, and probably more. Data breach dates back to 2012 According to the listing's descriptions, Peace says the data is old, approximately from 2012, the same year when Marissa Mayer was named Yahoo's CEO.

- Since nobody knows Verizon's plan for Yahoo, the hacker's probable plan is to monetize the user accounts before they lose any more value, in the case Verizon decides to ditch them or integrate them into other services. In a conversation with Softpedia about his recent Dark Web listing, Peace told your reporter that "I am not aware when Marissa Mayer started working, however in 2012 is when the database was dumped by [the] same [R]ussians of linkedin, vk, tumbr etc etc.

- For some records, there is also a backup email addresses, country of origin, and ZIP code for US users. Since the passwords are MD5-encrypted, Yahoo users are in a world of trouble right now, since MD5 hashes can be decrypted almost instantly these days, meaning their passwords are practically exposed as cleartext. Softpedia has reached out to Yahoo regarding the incident.

-  Peace made over $65,000 from his data dumps In conversations with other hackers on TheRealDeal, your reporter was told that many of today's Dark Web sellers are now actively seeking to make their listings public to the press, taking inspiration from Peace. The reason behind their approach is simple and has to do with the huge media coverage that has boosted Peace's sales.

- "65k [USD] including the other breaches," he also added. If confirmed, the Yahoo breach will no doubt bring the same attention from the media as the other breaches, and it will certainly help Peace net over $100,000 in just two-three months. Right now, we recommend users to follow Yahoo's advice and change their account passwords just in case their data was included in the records sold by Peace. UPDATE [August 2, 2016]: We were made aware of a similar report on Peace's Yahoo listing from Motherboard.

## The Chip Card Transition In the US Has Been a Disaster

- Ian Kar, writing for Quartz: Over the last year or so in the U.S., a lot of the plastic credit cards we carry around every day have been replaced by new one with chips embedded in them.

- The chips are supposed to make your credit and debit cards more secure -- a good thing!

- -- but there's one little secret no one wants to admit: The U.S.'s transition to chip cards has been an utter disaster.

- They're confusing to use, painstakingly slow, less secure than the alternatives, and aren't even the best solution for consumers.

- And on top of that, even though many retailers now have chip reading machines, some of them ask us just the opposite -- they say not to insert the card, and just swipe.

## QRLJacking Attack Can Bypass Any QR Login System

- SQRLs or Secure, Quick, Reliable Logins: "[As detailed by Seekurity Labs researcher Mohamed A. Baset], QRLJacking (i.e. Quick Response Code Login Jacking) is a method for tricking users into effectively logging into an online account on behalf of the attacker by making them scan the wrong QR code,"

- In a Facebook post, Baset says he tested his attack on sites such as WhatsApp, WeChat, Line, Weibo, QQ Instant Messaging, QQ Mail, Alibaba, and more,"

- The crook can modify these login details, add the data belonging to his PC, relay the data from his phone to the default login server, and access the victim's account from his PC.

- The QRLJacking attack is nothing more than a social engineering attack that works by requesting a QR code for the service the victim is trying to log in to and modifying the QR code to send the confirmation message to the attacker's computer.

- This attack needs both the attacker and the victim to be online at the same time, and can be defeated by any user that pays attention to the URL

## Donald Trump Signs Pledge To Crack Down On Internet Porn

- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has pledged to crack down on Internet pornography via corporate partnerships -- and he could possibly establish a federal commission on the harmful effects of porngraphy, a nonprofit announced Monday.

- PCWorld reports: Enough is Enough, a nonprofit dedicated to confronting online pornography, child pornography, child stalking and sexual predation, published Trump's signed pledge on Monday.

- Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton refused to sign the pledge, Enough is Enough said, though her campaign told EiE that she supported its goals.

- "Preventing the sexual exploitation of youth online requires a multi-faceted holistic strategy with a shared responsibility between the public, industry, and government," Donna Rice Hughes, the chief executive of Enough is Enough, said in a statement.

- For nearly two decades, bi-partisan government commissions, task forces, Internet safety groups, and researchers, who have recognized the significant risks associated with unfettered Internet access by youth, and have called upon the government and law enforcement to take aggressive action.

## A Famed Hacker Is Grading Thousands of Programs

- It may also push software makers to improve their code to avoid a low score and remain competitive. There are applications out there that really do demonstrate good [security] hygiene ... and the vast majority are somewhere else on the continuum from moderate to atrocious, Peiter Zatko says.

- ) The technique involves, in part, analyzing binary software files using algorithms created by Sarah to measure the security hygiene of code.

- Theyre the things that make software better than it used to be. Modern compilers of Linux and OS X not only add protective features, they automatically swap out bad functions in code with safer equivalent ones when available.

- The Zatkos venture could fill that gap, Wysopal says. Two years ago, Mudge says someone from the White House technology office approached him about helping to set up a government program to evaluate software.

- Theyve also had interest from AIG and other insurers who want to use the data to do risk-assessments of companies seeking cyber insurance. But there is at least one downside to scoring software like this: Attackers can use it to gauge where they should focus their energy to find vulnerabilities, targeting low-scoring applications.

## Sex offenders banned from Pokemon Go in New York

- In fact, they aren't allowed to play any "internet enabled gaming activities."

- Protecting New Yorks children is priority number one and, as technology evolves, we must ensure these advances don't become new avenues for dangerous predators to prey on new victims," Governor Cuomo said.

- "These actions will provide safeguards for the players of these augmented reality games and help take one more tool away from those seeking to do harm to our children.

- The focus on Pokemon Go is due to the fact that players  many of them kids  are encouraged to walk along urban streets, sometimes near residential addresses of sex offenders.

- Its a subscription service that delivers 10 games directly to our inboxes each monthall of them ours to keep forever, no strings attached.

## Reverse engineering and removing Pokemon GOs certificate pinning

- After spending so many years reverse engineering PowerPC executables on the Xbox 360 platform, I quickly got the hang of ARM and am happy to share some important information that will aid the Pokemon GO dev community. By now, you have probably noticed you can no longer MITM HTTPS requests between your Android device and the Niantic Labs/Pokemon GO servers.

- It is recommended you use a throwaway account when you need to MITM, just in case there are any custom/secret APK modification checks. If you log in using Google... Due to an Android security feature, you may be unable to log in to Pokemon GO using your Google account with a patched APK. Reverse engineering the certificate pinning Note: These steps are only valid for Pokemon GO version 0.31.0. If you arent interested in learning how this was done and just want to patch your APK, scroll down to Patching the APK. Pokemon GO obviously must have the entire leaf, intermediate, or root certificate or at least the public key to validate against somewhere in the APK, likely in a file that contains code.

- By overriding it, they, according to Java documentation, have the option to Return an array of certificate authority certificates which are trusted for authenticating peers. Lets see if there is anything interesting in this function.  Ive spent enough time reverse engineering to know that a memcmp (compare two blocks of memory) and a Rejected string appearing in the same function is definitely something worth investigating.

- Putting additional load on the already-stressed servers could degrade the experience of millions of players around the world and encourage Niantic Labs to implement further API restrictions.

- I plan to write about more security related topics in the future, so feel free to use the option on the sidebar to subscribe to new posts, or follow me on Twitter. -Eaton

## Full Disclosure  RCEs in nbox recorder

- Listening to all your corporate communications or production traffic and storing them on disk.

-    This level of exposure caught my eye, and I wanted to verify that having one of these sitting in your network does not make you more exposed.

- Unfortunately, I found several issues that could have been catastrophic with a malicious intent.

- The following table details the timeline around my disclosure communications: 

- I again want to highlight that I take this process very seriously, but after consulting with multiple other individuals, I feel that both the ntop team and MITRE have left me no other responsible options.   Here comes the paintrain!

## Solar Shed Summary: My Off Grid Office

- Why?   Plywood gives me a solid surface for mounting shelves, monitors, charge controllers, etc.

- And I'm not any good at it. As my structure is too small to require permits or inspections, I don't need to abide by silly bits of code.

- I'm not concerned with room-to-room fire spread resistance in a single room office.    The 1/2" plywood goes up similarly to the foamboard, though I'm using 4" screws to secure it to the studs.

- The angle aluminum blocks the light from blinding me, offers a smooth surface for the adhesive to stick to, and provides a good heat sink for the LEDs - some LED strips can run quite hot without a heat sink.    All the lighting is "cool white" - this is an office, so I prefer cooler color temperatures in here.

- Next week, this blog will be back to it's usual business of ripping apart battery packs, analyzing goofy electronics out of China, and doing the math on things that matter.

## Security Vulnerabilities in Wireless Keyboards

- On Tuesday Bastille's research team revealed a new set of wireless keyboard attacks they're calling Keysniffer

- . The technique, which they're planning to detail at the Defcon hacker conference in two weeks, allows any hacker with a $12 radio device to intercept the connection between any of eight wireless keyboards and a computer from 250 feet away.

- What's more, it gives the hacker the ability to both type keystrokes on the victim machine and silently record the target's typing.

- This is a continuation of their previous work

## Android's latest patches once again remind us: It's Nexus or bust if you want decent security

- Owners of Nexus gear will get these patches over-the-air very soon; everyone else will have to wait for their gadget makers and cellphone networks to issue them  which might be forever, leaving them forever vulnerable. These holes include programming blunders in Mediaserver that can be exploited by a specially crafted MMS or an in-browser media file to potentially execute malicious code on a device.

- Getting a bad text or visiting an evil webpage could be enough to slip spyware onto your device, provided it is able to defeat ASLR and other defense mechanisms. Mediaserver has other bugs, including four elevation-of-privileges holes allowing installed apps to gain more control of a device than they should, and code cockups that can crash a handheld. The remaining patches address information leakages in the Wi-Fi, camera, SurfaceFlinger and Mediaserver code, and OpenSSL, all of which can be abused by installed apps to "access sensitive data without permission."

- The second patch bundle contains fixes for driver-level code, and whether or not you need each of them depends on your hardware: if you have a chipset that introduces one of these vulnerabilities, you'll need to install a fix. Nexus owners will get these automatically as necessary; other phone and tablet manufacturers may roll them out as and when they feel ready.

- That could be never in some cases. The bundle predominantly fixes problems with Qualcomm's driver software  Qualy being the dominant Android system-on-chip designer, and its Snapdragon SoCs are used pretty much everywhere.

- An app could use these holes to root a Nexus 5, 5X, 6, 6P and 7 so badly it would need a complete factory reset to undo the damage. There are other bugs fixed in this batch because they can be exploited by malicious applications on Qualcomm-powered devices to access "sensitive data without explicit user permission."

## Black Hats control Jeep's steering, kill brakes

- 

- Black Hat video Car hackers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek have again hacked a 2014 Jeep Cherokee, this time by physically linking a laptop to commandeer its steering and kill the brakes. The duo have captured the hack to be presented at Black Hat Las Vegas this week in video proof-of-concept demonstrations.  

- The compromise requires attackers to be physically present in order to compromise the car. However Miller confirmed this writer's suggestion that the attacks could be carried out using a concealed device which either contains automated and timed commands, or iwth remote attacks over a wireless link. Such a feat which Miller says were "most definitely" possible could be considered a vector for targeted, albeit over-engineered, assassination. The localised attack is similar to other CAN bus attacks in which researchers have popped locks, compromised steering, and brakes. There are legitimate uses for tapping CAN buses that have spawned companies which manufacture products that tap into the ports in order to display detailed fuel consumption and engine data to drivers, for example. In one of the proof-of-concept videos Miller sits in the back of the Jeep with a lead connecting his laptop to the CAN bus above the dashboard.  Youtube Video  Valasek cruises at low speed through a cornfield road until Miller causes the steering wheel of the Jeep to lock 90 degrees to the right sending it off road. The attack affects the same Jeep which was patched after the duo remotely hacked it last year killing the engine during a live demonstration on US highway I-64.  Youtube Video  The pair attacked the Jeep's electronic control units disabling one by sending it into a maintenance mode and using another to send spoofed commands. Cruise control speed can also be set but drivers can quickly regain control by tapping brakes.  Youtube Video  The pair say they've penned a paper, to be revealed at Black Hat, in which they recommend vehicle manufacturers should better lock down CAN buses.

- To help auto-makers along, the pair have built an intrusion detection system that can detect their attacks.

## Debian and Tor Services available as Onion Services

- These sites can now be reached without leaving the Tor network, providing a new option for securely connecting to resources provided by Debian and Tor. The freedom to use open source software may be compromised when access to that software is monitored, logged, limited, prevented, or prohibited.

- Instead, we employ onion services because they provide end-to-end integrity and confidentiality, and they authenticate the onion service end point. For instance, when users connect to the onion service running at http://sejnfjrq6szgca7v.onion/ using a Tor-enabled browser such as the TorBrowser, they can be certain that their connection to the Debian website cannot be read or modified by third parties, and that the website that they are visiting is indeed the Debian website.

- However, crucially, onion services do not rely on third-party certificate authorities (CAs).

- With the apt-transport-tor package installed, the following three lines can replace the normal debian mirror entries in the apt configuration file (/etc/apt/sources.list):  deb tor+http://vwakviie2ienjx6t.onion/debian jessie main deb tor+http://vwakviie2ienjx6t.onion/debian jessie-updates main deb tor+http://sgvtcaew4bxjd7ln.onion/debian-security jessie/updates main  Likewise, Tor's Debian package repository is available from an onion service :  deb tor+http://sdscoq7snqtznauu.onion/torproject.org jessie main  Where appropriate, we provide services redundantly from several backend machines using OnionBalance.

- We expect to expand these lists in the near future to cover even more of Debian's and Tor's services.

## Bitcoin Exchange Bitfinex Says It Was Hacked, Roughly $60M Stolen

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex said late on Tuesday it has suspended trading on its exchange after it discovered a security breach, according to a company statement on its website.

- The company said it has also suspended deposits and withdrawals of digital currencies from the exchange.

- "We are investigating the breach to determine what happened, but we know that some of our users have had their bitcoins stolen," the company said.

- While we conduct this initial investigation and secure our environment, bitfinex.com will be taken down and the maintenance page will be left up."

- "In response, bitcoin prices fell to $560.16 by 19:30 UTC, $530 by 23:30 and $480 at press time, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals," reports CoinDesk.

## Iranians connected to phishing attempt on tortured Syrian activist

-  Al-Ameer smelled a phish and sent the email to the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab (previously), who traced the attack and found a seemingly accidentally exposed logfile on the phishing site that points to the attack having an Iranian connection; "possibly a privateer and likely working for either the Syrian or Iranian governments (or both)."

- Like a chameleon, Group5 borrows opposition text and slogans for e-mail messages and watering holes, showing evidence of good social engineering and targeting.

- This is a common feature of many operations in the Syrian context: since the baseline security of many of the targets is very low, many successful threat actors seem to conserve (and in some cases not possess) more sophisticated techniques.

- Group5 is just the latest addition to an expanding cast of actors targeting Syrian opposition groups, and its entry into the conflict shows the continuing information security risks that they face.

## Big rigs can be hijacked and driven with software-based attacks

-   Most disturbingly, the researchers managed to speed up the truck against the drivers will, by sending signals spoofing the vehicles powertrain commands to limit the trucks acceleration or max out its RPMs in any gear.

- These demonstrations come with two significant caveats: First, the researchers performed their tests by plugging a laptop directly into an OBD port on the dashboard of the target trucks, rather than search for a wireless entrypoint into the vehicle that an actual malicious hacker would likely need to access its network.

- Early this year, one security researcher found thousands of trucks left open to over-the-Internet attacks via an insecure telematics dongle that tracks gas mileage and location.

## Nvidia CEO tells female raffle winner: You dont even know what a GPU is, huh?

- The focus of the Meetup was a presentation by Stanford professor and Chief Scientist at Baidu, Andrew Ng, and while VR people are more likely to think of GPUs as high-end gaming tech, theyre also crucial for machine learning applications.

- So it made sense for the company to debut Titan X in a room full of AI professionals.As part of the announcement Nvidia raffled off two Titan Xs to members of the audience, and when the first recipient appeared, Huang responded to the appearance of a young woman with, You dont even know what a GPU is, huh? The young woman laughed, but there were some groans from the room.I saw Huangs comment on Friday, where it was being discussed on a Women in VR Facebook group.

- Comments quickly appeared on the thread, ranging from mild exasperation and a GIF of a princess flipping a table to outraged vows to boycott Nvidia GPUs.

- So what seems to be the butt of the joke is womens ability to understand (and interest in) technology.If that is the case, even taking into consideration that it was an off-the-cuff remark, and probably indicative of some subconscious biases rather than overt impulses, it clearly merits discussion.Why?

- Thats not to say that soft condescension and dumb jokes about whether lady brains can handle the complexities of technology X are okay coming from junior engineers, but senior leadership is more visible and more powerful, and by virtue of that, more responsible for how they present themselves and their companies.Personally, when I saw the clip, I wasnt outraged  in part because Ive been working in male-dominated fields for so long that what I think of as Dumb Widdle Girl syndrome is so common that I think of it as background noise at this point.

## Firefox 48 Released With Multi-Process Support, Mandatory Add-On Signing

- Mozilla on Tuesday released Firefox v48, touted as one of the most important updates the browser has ever received.

- From a Softpedia article: Announced last year, Electrolysis, e10s, or multi-process support is Firefox's ability to process core browser operations separately from the content viewed on a Web page.

- Mandatory add-on signing refers to Firefox preventing users from installing any add-ons that have not been approved by Mozilla's testers.

- This is something similar to what Chrome employs, but Firefox users have been spoiled all these years, always having the capability of installing any add-on they've desired.

- Rust is a programming language that's a revamped and improved version of C++ but that protects developers from accidentally including dangerous memory bugs in their code.

## Hackers Break Into Telegram, Revealing 15 Million Users' Phone Numbers

- A vulnerability in Telegram has exposed the data of millions of people in Iran.

- Hackers in the country have compromised dozens of accounts by an SMS redirection hack, and also identified phone numbers of 15 million users, according to a report on Reuters.

- From the report: The attacks, which took place this year and have not been previously reported, jeopardized the communications of activists, journalists and other people in sensitive positions in Iran, where Telegram is used by some 20 million people, said independent cyber researcher Collin Anderson and Amnesty International technologist Claudio Guarnieri, who have been studying Iranian hacking groups for three years.As for the attack, hackers aren't targeting the encryption that protects messages between accounts, but how a phone number is tied to an account.

- Hackers are intercepting that SMS and cloning the data to a compromised device.  Update: Telegram reached out to Slashdot on Twitter with a link to a blog post that included: Certain people checked whether some Iranian numbers were registered on Telegram and were able to confirm this for 15 million accounts.

- ). Read the rest of Telegram's official statement, including SMS codes allegedly being intercepted, here.

## Dental Floss May Have No Medical Benefits, Says AP Report

- Joe_NoOne quotes a report from Gizmodo: Flossing may not yield the protective benefits we've been told to expect.

- Since 1979, the federal government in the U.S. has recommended daily flossing, but by law these dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years, have to be supported by scientific evidence.

- " AP national writer Jeff Donn reports: "The two leading professional groups -- the American Dental Association and the American Academy of Periodontology, for specialists in gum disease and implants -- cited other studies as proof of their claims that flossing prevents buildup of gunk known as plaque, early gum inflammation called gingivitis, and tooth decay.

- Such research, like the reviewed studies, focused on warning signs like bleeding and inflammation, barely dealing with gum disease or cavities.

- Wayne Aldredge, president of the periodontistsa(TM) group, acknowledged the weak scientific evidence and the brief duration of many studies...Still, he urges his patients to floss to help avoid gum disease.

- Dubbed Autoclave, it limits the ability of the code running in the VM to communicate, and monitors what's going on inside

- IronFrame can be built into a "magic browser," he said, which would allow web designers to build webpages that allow functions in a known safe state.

- Astatica, aims to apply machine learning techniques to information security.

- Astatica ingests information about software vulnerabilities and is trained to spot future insecurities. The system is still in its early stages, and Kaminsky says it could be a major breakthrough in teaching people about computer security.

## New attack steals SSNs, e-mail addresses, and more from HTTPS pages

- To determine the size of an HTTPS-protected response, the attacker uses an oracle technique that returns what amounts to a yes-or-no response to each guess

- When a request containing "value=" results in the same data size, the attacker knows that string is inside the encrypted response and then tries to modify the guess to include the next character, say "value=0"

- If that guess results in a larger file size the attacker knows it's wrong and will try "value=1", "value-=2", and so on until the new guess similarly results in a response that shows no increase in file size

- The attacker then tries to guess the next character and repeats the process until the entire token has been recovered.

- Van Goethem said the only mitigation he knows of is to disable the third-party cookies, since responses sent by the HTTPS site are no longer associated with the victim. At the moment, most Web browsers by default enable the receipt of third-party cookies, and some online services don't work unless third-party cookies are allowed.

## Users of secure chat app Telegram popped after likely State attack

- Black Hat An attack group known for rudimentary phishing scams and having operational security so bad their servers were popped by Check Point has compromised a dozen Telegram accounts and gained phone numbers for a further 15 million, possibly with state assistance. Telegram is a well-regarded end-to-end encrypted chat client used by some 100 million users including 20 million of Iran's 77 million residents.  

- Tried-and-tested phone porting scams would be another way to redirect the text messages in order for attackers to add themselves as additional users on targeted Telegram accounts. The "Rocket Kitten" hacking group has previously targeted civilian organisations and academia in Germany and Israel and holds some level of supporting interest in the Iranian state.

- It has compromised Israeli nuclear scientists and physicists, ex-military, Saudi scholars, NATO regional posts, and various media outlets. It is behind hundreds of campaigns, labelled "projects" by the group, cooked up to compromise various targets. It last year targeted organisations and probed security researchers with old-school and largely defunct macro document scams that require users of modern Office installations to click through security warnings to deliberately enable macros.

- Check Point popped the group's servers in November and found what it reckoned was the real identities of two Rocket Kitten members. The operational security blunder meant one group member linked his alias with a real identity, while the entire group had infected their systems with their own malware in what Check Point wonks called an "utter lack of operational security". "If all that wasnt enough, we also managed to retrieve an updated resume for [one of the attackers]," they said at the time. Check Point guessed the group was part of the large contingent of nationalist script kiddies who use scripts and bots to deface thousands of sites every day, and were roped into the world of espionage by Tehran. Researchers Claudio Guarnieri of Amnesty International and independent hacker Collin Anderson suspect Iranian ISPs may have been prevailed upon to assist the attack, the pair told Reuters ahead of their talk at Black Hat Las Vegas. "We have over a dozen cases in which Telegram accounts have been compromised, through ways that sound like basically coordination with the cellphone company," Anderson told the wire service. The verification method is used by almost all IT services including Google and Facebook as a seemingly unshakable trade-off between convenience and security. Compromising SMS is easy for established hackers.

- A target's basic information is all that's required - and often much less - for telecommunications providers to allow all incoming calls and SMS to be redirected to an attacker's phone number. It is useful for capturing two factor authentication codes and bank transfer confirmation when stealing funds. Telcos are notorious for allowing phone porting using information obtainable from most Facebook accounts.

## The Bitfinex Bitcoin Hack: What We Know (And Don't Know)

- Yesterday, BitGo took to social media to state that an internal investigation had turned up no evidence of a server breach on their end.

- Yet despite the assurances, some observers have blamed the service for "blindly signing" the withdrawal of nearly 120,000 BTC and wondered why no potential countermeasures were in place in the event of a movement of funds of that size.

- the companies sought to find an alternative to the standard process used by exchanges at the time that saw customer funds co-mingled in larger offline wallets and connected or "hot" wallets used to meet liquidity demands.

- Rather, each Bitfinex user has their own set of keys created on the platform, using a 2-of-3 key arrangement whereby Bitfinex held two of the keys (including one offline) and BitGo used the third to co-sign transactions.

- In order to withdraw such a large amount of funds, BitGo would likely have had to sign off on those transactions.

- A * value is allowed too, which means "not specified". MSS: maximum segment size specified in the TCP options.

- Maybe if we all worked together one day we could solve the DDoS problem for all. Releasing our code open source is an important part of CloudFlare.

- We hope others affected by SYN floods will find it useful. Do you enjoy playing with low level networking bits?

- If so you should definitely have a look at the opened positions in our London, San Francisco, Singapore, Champaign (IL) and Austin (TX) offices!

## PGP Key of Mahmood Khadeer, Pres. Of Muslim Association of Puget Sound, Factored

- Phuctor is a public service, operated by S.NSA. It catalogues extant RSA public keys which are known to be inexpensively breakable.

- Recently, Phuctor's algorithmic arsenal was expanded to include a search for perfect squares, which was then further generalized to Fermat's factorization method

- A perfect square RSA modulus results from an ill-conceived, subverted, or otherwise catastrophically-broken key generator where a cryptographic prime P is created and immediately re-used verbatim, as prime Q

- An RSA modulus factorable via Fermat's method contains two factors which are dangerously (i.e., cheaply-discoverably) close together

- The subsequent search for Fermat-factorable RSA moduli yielded exactly one additional result. This very peculiar PGP public key is suggestive of an aborted attempt at the development of a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against PGP users who might decode the key and display its User ID field in certain WWW browsers.

- Mr. Khadeer is the President of the Muslim Association of Puget Sound (MAPS) in Redmond (archived), famous primarily for 'heartfelt condemnations' (archived) of this and that

## Microsoft Live Account Credentials Leaking From Windows 8 And Above

-  Discovered in 1997 by Aaron Spangler and never fixed, the WinNT/Win95 Automatic Authentication Vulnerability (IE Bug #4) is certainly an excellent vintage.

- In Windows 8 and 10, the same bug has now been found to potentially leak the users Microsoft Live account login and (hashed) password information, which is also used to access OneDrive, Outlook, Office, Mobile, Bing, Xbox Live, MSN and Skype (if used with a Microsoft account).

- in the white paper. Basically, the default User Authentification Settings of Edge/Spartan (also Internet Explorer, Outlook) lets the browser connect to local network shares, but erroneously fail to block connections to remote shares.

- An embedded image link that points to that network share is then sent to the victim, for example as part of an email or website.

- As soon as the prepped content is viewed inside a Microsoft product such as Edge/Spartan, Internet Explorer or Outlook, that software will try to connect to that share in order to download the image.

## ProtonMail now the maintainer of OpenPGPjs email encryption library

- We would like to thank Tankred Hase, formerly the co-founder of whiteout.io, for his many years of effort developing the project as the previous maintainer, and we wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.

- Since it was first formulated in 1991, PGP has undergone extensive peer review and scrutiny which makes it a good choice for securing email data. In addition to ProtonMail, OpenPGPjs is used by the Mailvelope browser extension, GlobalLeaks, and many other JavaScript PGP applications.

- Since originating from Recurity Labs in Berlin, OpenPGPjs has grown to become used by several million end users.

- ProtonMail was a major contributor of code to the latest major version (2.x) of OpenPGPjs and thus was a natural choice to take over as primary maintainer of the project. The future of email encryption with OpenPGPjs Our primary mission at ProtonMail is the protection of privacy via widespread adoption of encrypted communications.

- We are committed to keeping the development of OpenPGPjs transparent and maintaining a high level of flexibility so it can be easily incorporated into other web projects that have a need for PGP encryption.

## Massachusetts Bans Employers from Asking Applicants About Previous Pay

- Charlie Baker with State Treasurer Deborah Goldberg after he signed the salary bill into law on Monday. 

- Elise Amendola/Associated Press           In a groundbreaking effort to close the wage gap between men and women, Massachusetts has become the first state to bar employers from asking about applicants salaries before making them job offers.The new law will require hiring managers to offer a compensation figure upfront  based on what the applicants worth is to the company, rather than on what he or she made at a previous position.The bipartisan legislation, signed into law Monday by Gov.

- Charlie Baker, a Republican, could inspire similar rules in other liberal-leaning states, as the issue of men historically outearning women who are doing the same job has leapt onto the national political scene.

- Nationally, there have been repeated efforts to strengthen equal pay laws  which are already on the books but tend to lack teeth  but none have succeeded so far.I think very few businesses consciously discriminate, but they need to become aware of it, said a Massachusetts State Senator Pat Jehlen, Democrat of Somerville, one of the bills co-sponsors.

- Nationally, women are paid 79 cents for every dollar that men earn, according to the Census Bureau.The Massachusetts bill passed the State Legislature unanimously and won support from a number of local business groups, including the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, which initially opposed the new legislation but withdrew its objections after some changes were made.Equal pay has been a flash point in the presidential race this year, with Hillary Clinton trying to make it a signature issue, and Donald J. Trump accusing the Clinton Foundation of paying men more than women.In her speech last week accepting the Democratic nomination, Mrs. Clinton urged those who believe that your working mother, wife, sister or daughter deserves equal pay to join her.On the Republican stage a week earlier, Ivanka Trump praised her father, Donald J. Trump, for his actions on the issue.Politicians talk about wage equality, but my father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career, Ms. Trump said.

-  Subsequent to this, the federal guidelines on dental health were revised, and the recommendation to floss was silently removed.

- The evidence for flossing is "weak, very unreliable," of "very low" quality, and carries "a moderate to large potential for bias."

-  "The majority of available studies fail to demonstrate that flossing is generally effective in plaque removal," said one review conducted last year.

## Bitcoin Drops Nearly 20% as Exchange Hack Amplifies Price Decline

-  The price of bitcoin fell sharply today exacerbating an already ongoing decline as global market participants reacted to news that one of the largest digital currency exchanges had been hacked. Earlier this afternoon, Hong Kong-based exchange Bitfinex halted trading after discovering a security breach, which included taking its website offline and pausing all withdrawals and deposits.

- Representatives from the exchange told CoinDesk engineers were seeking to uncover issues at press time, though the company had confirmed roughly 120,000 BTC (more than $60m) was lost or stolen via social media. In response, bitcoin prices fell to $560.16 by 19:30 UTC, $530 by 23:30 and $480 at press time, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals. This price was roughly 20% lower than the days opening of $607.37 and 27% below the high of $658.28 reached on Saturday, 30th July, when the digital currency began pushing lower. Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin leverage trading firm BitMEX, emphasized that this event had a clear and measurable effect on bitcoin prices. He told CoinDesk: "A high profile hack is not good for sentiment and curtails the ability for market makers to keep an orderly market.

- " Market observer and trader Jacob Eliosoff provided similar input, telling CoinDesk that the event had sparked a new wave of uncertainty. "The big question will be how much was stolen and whether Bitfinex will make customers whole," he said. Market participants traded more than 600,000 BTC via Bitfinex during the 30 days through 2nd August, Bitcoinity data reveals.

- This figure represented represented 1.6% of the more than 39m BTC transacted through various exchanges during the 30-day period. The halving's impact However, the price decline does not appear to be the sole result of the issues at Bitfinex. Bitcoin prices experienced a gradual, downward movement over the course of several days, with market observers pointing to the halving of rewards on the bitcoin network as the cause.

- Now that the digital currency has breached $600, it will test $550, its low before the Brexit vote, said Hayes. Tim Enneking, chairmain of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, interpreted the recent price decline as evidence of a post-halving fallback, further stating that bitcoin will find support above $500. Zivkovksi told CoinDesk that the digital currencys decline below $600 could signal the start of a medium term bearish trend powered by a strong long squeeze and a lull in bitcoin interest by the general public. While these analysts pointed to future weakness in the digital currency and potential declines, Demeester emphasized that not only did he not "see any sign why this bull market is over, but he expected the price would "go a lot higher over the next 12 months".

- monkeyzoo writes: Softpedia reports that Torrentz.eu, the internet's biggest BitTorrent meta-search engine, has mysteriously and suddenly shut down.

- Visitors of the website see a simple message that reads, "Torrentz was a free, fast and powerful meta-search engine combining results from dozens of search engines."

- Trying to run a search, or clicking any link on the site changes that message to "Torrentz will always love you.

- The reason for the disappearance is mysterious, but there is speculation that Torrentz.eu admins decided to pull the plug on their own and avoid any future legal problems in the wake of increasing legal pressure on The Pirate Bay and the arrests related to KickassTorrents.

## Hacked Bitcoin firm plans to spread losses across all users

- "We are still working out the details so nothing is set in stone, however we are leaning towards a socialized loss scenario among bitcoin balances and active loans to (bitcoin/dollar) positions," the Hong-Kong based company said on its website on Friday.

- Bitfinex revealed it had been hacked on Tuesday and suspended trading, causing prices of the digital currency to fall significantly.

- A total of 119,756 bitcoins, worth $68 million at current prices, were reportedly stolen as a result of a security breach.

- To what degree depends on the devil in the details and what the total capital held by BitFinex is," Hayter told CNBC via email. 

-   "Some users who were not hacked will feel angry at having to stump up their funds to cover shortfalls elsewhere on the exchange.

## Frequent Password Changes is a Bad Security Idea

- I've been saying for years that it's bad security advice, that it encourages poor passwords.

- By studying the data, the researchers identified common techniques account holders used when they were required to change passwords.

- "The UNC researchers said if people have to change their passwords every 90 days, they tend to use a pattern and they do what we call a transformation," Cranor explained.

- The researchers used the transformations they uncovered to develop algorithms that were able to predict changes with great accuracy.

- In offline attacks performed on the recovered hashes using superfast computers, 41 percent of the changed passwords were cracked within three seconds.

## Telegram Hack  Possible Nation State Attack By Iran

- Theres 2 vectors of attack at play here, both of which regard Iranian users, but are not connected (other than the attackers probably being the same group).  So the two attacks were related to two totally different parts of the Telegram stack, one being targeted at a small number of user accounts via SMS 2FA and the other being a fairly basic API brute-force for information gathering purposes. Amnesty International technologist and researcher Claudio Guarnieri and independent security researcher Collin Anderson traced recent Telegram account breaches in Iran to the SMS messages Telegram sends to people when they activate a new device.

- Their focus generally revolves around those with an interest in Iran and defense issues, but their activity is absolutely global, says John Hultquist, who manages the cyber espionage intelligence team at the security firm FireEye, of Rocket Kitten.

- In the case of the Telegram attacks, the researchers also suggested that SMS messages may have been compromised by Iranian cell phone companies themselves, an industry that also has potential ties to the government. 

-  So the first part is quite serious, as it means the bad actors can totally hijack the accounts of certain users by receiving the new device activation code via SMS.

- Which they could then choose who to hijack using the SMS authentication message (only 12 users). Which means the gravity of this hack in the media is often overstated. Source: Wired

## How the HTTPS-snooping, email addy and SSN-raiding HEIST JavaScript code works

- fetch('https://myhealthcare.org/myprofile',
{ mode: "no-cors", credentials: "include"});

- This calls fetch(), telling it to hand over the user's credentials  their login cookie so we can continue to log in as them  and to use a standard HTTP GET call to fetch the profile page

- when using HEAD, GET or POST, the JavaScript code is not allowed to see the encrypted page returned by the website

- fetch() is aimed at asynchronous communications: it returns a Promise object that triggers a callback as soon as the first byte is received from the server

- Using performance.getEntries() it is possible to find out when the last byte was received

- So we have a start time and a stop time

- packets of data will have been sent in batches, known as congestion windows, one window at a time, one after the other, with a slight pause at the end of each window for the browser to acknowledge to the server that everything is going OK.

- It is possible, judging from the time taken, to work out if a fetched page fitted inside one or more than one window

- If there's a block of duplicated information on the page, the server sends that block once

- If the HEIST script can send a request to a website knowing that part of the request will appear on the page, it can vary that request to, byte by byte, sniff out the contents of the encrypted page.

- et's say the page being targeted includes an email address, bob@example.com

- we send aaa@example.com and get back, say, 200 bytes of compressed encrypted data

- We next send a combination of addresses until we hit bob@example.com and get back 184 bytes

- The researchers said that the only way to protect against HEIST is to disable third-party cookies, which is an option on most browsers but not enabled by default. Disabling third-party cookies would prevent HEIST's fetch() call from authenticating with the raided webpage.

## Galaxy Note 7 Iris Scanner Explained

- According to the company, the device stores your registered iris information as an encrypted code safely in its hardware using its KNOX security platform

- Whenever you want to access content, such as a protected app, the device first captures your iris pattern for recognition, extracts and digitizes it

- then proceeds to match it with the encrypted code to provide access

- You can be sure that no one else apart from you can access your device in case it is stolen or lost because the Note 7 registers the iris information of only one person

- recognize the reflected images of the irises through an infrared light

- The light emitted from the Galaxy Note 7's display allows the scanner to receive data even in low light environments

- Samsung also plans to partner with major financial institutions to incorporate its iris scanner into mobile banking applications
