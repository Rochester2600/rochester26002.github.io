## Web security company breached, client list (including KKK) dumped, hackers mock inept security

- "TIPS WHEN RUNNING A SECURITY COMPANY," it details the security holes found during the breach:

- * Use one root password for all the boxes

- * Expose PDU's [power distribution units in server racks] to WAN with telnet auth

- * Never patch, upgrade or audit the stack

- * Disregard PDO [PHP Data Objects] as inconvenient

- * Hedge entire business on security theatre

- * Store full credit card info in plaintext

- * Write all code with wreckless [sic] abandon

## Critical flaw in Pidgin, Adium's Off The Record chat lib. Patch ASAP

- In order to successfully trigger the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send a data message of more than 5.5 gigabytes to a victim in order to pass the check "require_len(datalen)". Due to the support of fragmented OTR messages assembled by libotr this is possible in practice.

- Several instant messengers  including ChatSecure, Pidgin, Adium and Kopete  are affected by the remote-code execution bug in libotr

## Hacktivists caught tampering with water treatment plant

- Using the same credentials found on the payment app webserver, the threat actors were able to interface with the water districts valve and flow control application, also running on the AS400 system.

- Fortunately, based on alert functionality, KWC was able to quickly identify and reverse the chemical and flow changes, largely minimising the impact on customers.

- No clear motive for the attack was found.  Verizon's RISK Team uncovered evidence that the hacktivists had manipulated the valves controlling the flow of chemicals twice  though fortunately to no particular effect.

- We continue to see infrastructure systems being targeted because they are generally under-resourced or believed to be out of band or not connected to the internet. Beyond the clear need to invest in intrusion detection, prevention, patch management and analytics-driven security measures, this breach underscores the importance of actionable intelligence.

- For example, computer screenshots posted online back in November 2011 purported to show the user interface used to monitor and control equipment at the Water and Sewer Department for the City of South Houston, Texas by hackers who claimed to have pwned its systems.

## Extremely severe bug leaves dizzying number of software and devices vulnerable

- can be exploited when vulnerable devices or apps make queries to attacker-controlled domain names or domain name servers or when they're exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks where the adversary has the ability to monitor and manipulate data passing between a vulnerable device and the open Internet

- All versions of glibc after 2.9 are vulnerable.

- widely used secure shell, sudo, and curl utilities are all known to be vulnerable

- the vulnerability extends to an almost incomprehensibly large body of software, including virtually all distributions of Linux; the Python, PHP, and Ruby on Rails programming languages

- Google's Android mobile operating system. It uses a glibc substitute known as Bionic and isn't susceptible,

- Mitigating factors for UDP include:
- A firewall that drops UDP DNS packets > 512 bytes.
- A local resolver (that drops non-compliant responses).

- Mitigating factors for TCP include:
- Limit all replies to 1024 bytes.

## Amazon removed device encryption from Fire OS 5 because no one was using it

- Update: Amazon will release a software update this spring that will restore encryption support to Fire OS 5. Original story: In the wake of Apple's high-profile fight with the FBI, more users and journalists have been paying attention to encryption of local storage in phones and tablets.

- Apple strengthened the encryption on all iDevices in iOS 8, making it so that no one could decrypt the storage without knowing the user's passcode.

- However, according to user David Scovetta and others on Amazon's support forums, that encryption support has been deprecated and removed in recent releases of Fire OS 5, both for new Fire tablets and for older devices that have been upgraded. We contacted Amazon for comment, and the company told us that local device encryption support was removed in FireOS 5 because the feature wasn't being used: "In the fall when we released Fire OS 5, we removed some enterprise features that we found customers werent using," Amazon told Ars.

- This decision doesn't have the same impact that it would if Apple or Google removed encryption support from their operating systems, and if Amazon's statement is correct it doesn't look like many people were taking advantage of it anyway.

- But given that Amazon gets encryption support for "free" with the Android source code, it's disappointing to see that the company can't leave the option buried in the settings as it has on older Fire devices.

## New attack steals secret crypto keys from Android and iOS phones

## Why you probably shouldnt be doing work on that in-flight Wi-Fi

- But it's possible to do all sorts of things to fellow passengersas USA Today columnist Steven Petrow recently found out.

- For example, in previous tests (such as the ones we conducted with NPR), we saw iPads and iPhones that identified themselves to the network by their owner's name, and Web requests to websites and mobile app traffic (some including personal data) were also visible.

- And Gogo designed its network specifically with law enforcement needs in mind, as its executives explained in a 2012 letter to the Federal Communications Commission arguing against FCC-imposed monitoring requirements: "In designing its existing network, Gogo worked closely with law enforcement to incorporate functionalities and protections that would serve public safety and national security interests.

- Nevertheless, Gogo worked with federal agencies to reach agreement regarding a set of additional capabilities to accommodate law enforcement interests.

- Someone could use their laptop with two Wi-Fi adapters (one masquerading as the in-flight Wi-Fi access point using malicious access point software and the other connected to the legitimate service) and essentially do the same thing that Gogo didperform a man-in-the-middle attack by acting as an SSL proxy, issuing a fake certificate to Web connections that gives the evil laptop the ability to read everything that passes through before re-encrypting it and passing it on to the legitimate site.

## More than 11 million HTTPS websites imperiled by new decryption attack

- More than 11 million websites and e-mail services protected by the transport layer security protocol are vulnerable to a newly discovered, low-cost attack that decrypts sensitive communications in a matter of hours and in some cases almost immediately, an international team of researchers warned Tuesday.

- The most notable implementation subject to such fatal misconfigurations is the OpenSSL cryptographic library, which on Tuesday is expected to release an update that makes such settings much less likely to occur. Recent scans of the Internet at large show that more than 5.9 million Web servers, comprising 17 percent of all HTTPS-protected machines, directly support SSLv2.

- With names including BEAST, CRIME, BREACH, and FREAK, the proof-of-concept exploits have demonstrated dangerous holes in a protocol that's the sole means for most websites and e-mail servers to encrypt and authenticate communications over an Internet that was never designed to be secure or private.

- TLS security hit a new low last May with the discovery of Logjam, a vulnerability caused by deliberately weakened cryptography that allowed eavesdroppers to read and modify data passing through tens of thousands of Web and e-mail servers.

- Besides underscoring the dangers of deliberately weakened crypto, DROWN demonstrates the problems that result when obsolete protocols and specifications aren't explicitly forbidden and instead are allowed to be called on in what developers assume are special cases.

## Largely undetected Mac malware suggests disgraced HackingTeam has returned

- Researchers have uncovered what appears to be newly developed Mac malware from HackingTeam, a discovery that's prompting speculation that the disgraced malware-as-a-service provider has reemerged since last July's hack that spilled gigabytes worth of the group's private e-mail and source code. The sample was uploaded on February 4 to the Google-owned VirusTotal scanning service, which at the time showed it wasn't detected by any of the major antivirus programs.

- A technical analysis published Monday morning by SentinelOne security researcher Pedro Vilaca showed that the installer was last updated in October or November, and an embedded encryption key is dated October 16, three months after the HackingTeam compromise. The sample installs a copy of HackingTeam's signature Remote Code Systems compromise platform, leading Vilaca to conclude that the outfit's comeback mostly relies on old, largely unexceptional source code, despite the group vowing in July that it would return with new code. "HackingTeam is still alive and kicking but they are still the same crap morons as the e-mail leaks have show us," Vilaca wrote.

- " Patrick Wardle, a Mac security expert at Synack, has also examined the sample and says that while it appears to install a new version of the old HackingTeam implant, it uses several advanced tricks to evade detection and analysis.

- Even then, he found that the installer was "packed" in a digital wrapper that also limited the types of reverse engineering and analysis he wanted to perform. The sample still leaves many questions unanswered.

- People who want to know if a Mac is infected should check for a file named Bs-V7qIU.cYL, which is dropped into the ~/Library/Preferences/8pHbqThW/ directory. Vilaca said he can't conclusively determine that the new sample is the work of HackingTeam.

## Whole lotta onions: Number of Tor hidden sites spikesalong with paranoia

Because of the distributed nature of Ricochetit uses no centralized serverBrooks said he had no real figures on how many users the software had.

## Backup bods at Microsoft lose CA audit data after server crash

- Redmond is taking its first steps towards getting on top of the situation by letting CAs know the score, in a message to the cabforum.org security forum on Wednesday, requesting help in putting matters right. As many of you may have just noticed, our system just generated a bunch of emails informing many of you that you are subject to removal because Microsoft does not have evidence of a qualifying audit on file.

- Our CRM system suffered a data loss, and it looks like it rolled back to an old backup.

- Sorry for the confusion.  As part of Microsofts Trusted Root programs compliance requirements, Certificate Authorities must provide a courtesy copy of their audit data to the company annually.

- Were reliably informed that Microsoft stores these internally in a standalone tool.

- Asking third parties for data on themselves in the wake of a back-up bungle is not the biggest disaster in the world, but it doesnt look good either. Redmond would certainly be well advised to review its disaster recovery plan in the wake of the snafu.

## Tor takes aim against malicious nodes on the network

- The Tor Project is working with Princeton University boffins to try and identify possibly malicious nodes, and prevent them from harvesting traffic by gaming its node reputation system. Tor's reputation services collect flags from relays, from which they assess and publish (hourly) the reputation of relays, but the researchers from Princeton and the Tor project believe the network isn't sufficiently protected against Sybil attacks.  

- In a Sybil attack (named after the Flora Schreiber novel about dissociative identity disorder), a single individual controls multiple accounts to game a reputation system.

- However, the paper (by Princeton and Karlstad University's Philipp Winter, Roya Ensafi and Nick Feamster of Princeton, and the Tor Project's Karsten Loesing) notes that to get rid of dangerous nodes, the network needs ways to identify them. A miscreant, the authors say, can also use Sybils to snoop on exit traffic (for credential collection), fingerprint Websites users are connecting to, harvest bridge addresses (which undermines Tor's potential to circumvent censorship). The boffins trained their main tool, called sybilhunter, on historical network data about the Tor consensus (that is, the output of its reputation system), and turned up some interesting results, including:  

- Academic Sybils  they observed the Amazon EC2-hosted nodes operated by Biryukov, Pustogarov, and Weinmann for this 2013 paper; and

- The http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/12/27/tor_lizard_squad_sybil_attack/ LizardNSA attack on Tor.   The paper notes that sybilhunter isn't a complete answer to the problem.

## Google publishes list of Certificate Authorities it doesn't trust

- Google's announced another expansion to the security information offered in its transparency projects: it's now going to track certificates you might not want to trust. Certificate Authorities (CAs) that your browser (or smartphone) trusts have a suitable entry in settings, but if a site presents a certificate from an unknown source, the user is prompted about what to do.  

- Since users too often click through those warnings, Google's decided that a list of untrusted CAs might be useful to developers and sysadmins. Mountain View's software engineer, certificate transparency Martin Smith writes that while browser-trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) are easy to keep track of, there are two classes of CAs that pose a much harder problem. CAs that have been withdrawn from the trusted list, and new CAs that are on track for inclusion. Including these in trusted logs is problematic for several reasons, including uncertainties around revocation policies and the possibility of cross-signing attacks being attempted by malicious third-parties, Smith writes. Mountain View has dubbed the new Certificate Transparency log Submariner, and hosts it at ct.googleapis.com/submariner.

- Smith notes that it has the same API as Google's existing CA logs. The post hints that last year's Symantec certificate SNAFU provided some of the impetus to create a lookup of untrustworthy certificates.

- Symantec's subsidiary Thawte.com created a bunch of dodgy certificates for internal use  including one for Google.com  that escaped into the outside world. Those certificates are included on the don't-trust-this Submariner list: Initially, Submariner includes certificates chaining up to the set of root certificates that Symantec recently announced it had discontinued, as well as a collection of additional roots suggested to us that are pending inclusion in Mozilla, the post says. While the log provides a public record of certificates that are not accepted by the existing Google-operated logs, the list itself won't be trusted by Chrome.

## iMessage Encryption Flaw Found and Fixed

- Green suspected there might be a flaw in iMessage last year after he read an Apple security guide describing the encryption process and it struck him as weak.

- When a few months passed and the flaw remained, he and his graduate students decided to mount an attack to show that they could pierce the encryption on photos or videos sent through iMessage.

- The encrypted transmission they targeted contained a link to the photo stored in Apple's iCloud server as well as a 64-digit key to decrypt the photo.

- Going back to the new vulnerability that you'll learn about in mid-February, the lead researcher wrote to me: "If anyone tells you that [the vendor] can just 'tweak' the system a little bit to add key escrow or to man-in-the-middle specific users, they need to spend a few days watching the authentication dance between [the client device/software] and the umpteen servers it talks to just to log into the network.

- Called AceDeceiver, it is a Trojan that allows an attacker to install malicious software onto an iOS device, bypassing Apple's DRM protections.

## Why we should fear a cashless world | Dominic Frisby

- My worry is that a cashless society may exacerbate inequality even further. It will hand yet more power to the financial sector in that banks and related fintech companies will oversee all transactions.

- If your life savings were threatened with confiscation to bail out a corporation you considered profligate, I imagine you too would rush to withdraw them. We have seen similar panics in Greece and, to a lesser extent, across southern Europe.

- Many assume that the mobile succeeded where the landline failed, because the superior technology made widespread coverage more possible.

- Cash has its uses for small transactions  a chocolate bar, a newspaper, a pint of milk  which, in the UK, are still uneconomic to process by other means.

- I also like to shop in markets, where I can buy directly from the producer knowing they will receive the money, without middle men shaving off their percentages. It also has its uses for private transactions, for which there are many possible reasons, and by no means all of them illegal.

## Android rooting bug opens Nexus phones to permanent device compromise

- The flaw, which allows apps to gain nearly unfettered "root" access that bypasses the entire Android security model, has its origins in an elevation of privileges vulnerability in the Linux kernel. Linux developers fixed it in April 2014 but never identified it as a security threat

- For reasons that aren't clear, Android developers failed to patch it even after the flaw received the vulnerability identifier CVE-2015-1805 in February 2015.

- This issue is rated as a critical severity due to the possibility of a local permanent device compromise and the device would possibly need to be repaired by re-flashing the operating system."

## Stagefright flaw still a nightmare: '850 million' Androids face hijack risk

- Mobile security biz Zimperium reckons 600 to 850 million Android devices are still vulnerable to a Stagefright flaw that lets webpages and videos inject malware into phones and tablets. Stagefright is a software library buried deep within Android that processes multimedia files.

- When Stagefright is fed specially crafted video files, such as from a text message or website, these bugs can be triggered and exploited to run malicious code on the victim's gadget.

- This code can turn the phone or fondleslab against its owner, by spying on their passwords and photos, and so on. Browsing a dodgy webpage hosting a booby-trapped MP4 video can, theoretically, be enough to start the hijacking process. Although Google continuously and quietly pushes software updates and many security patches to about 90 per cent of active Android via its Google Play Services app, low-level bugs like those in Stagefright cannot be squashed without installing new firmware from Google. And there lies the rub.

- Because these firmware updates have to be signed off by manufacturers and mobile networks before they can be installed, potentially hundreds of millions of Android devices remain unpatched and at-risk because fixes aren't distributed in a timely fashion  or at all.

- In some countries, more than 70 per cent of Android devices are still vulnerable. In all, as many as 856 million devices are still vulnerable to Stagefright bug CVE-2015-3864  which was disclosed and patches released last year  according to Zimperium. Exploiting Stagefright is far from trivial, but not impossible once you defeat Android's ASLR protections.

## How One Dev Broke Node and Thousands of Projects In 11 Lines of JavaScript

- An anonymous reader quotes an article written by Chris Williams for The Register: Programmers were left staring at broken builds and failed installations on Tuesday after someone toppled the Jenga tower of JavaScript.

- A couple of hours ago, Azer Koculu unpublished more than 250 of his modules from NPM, which is a popular package manager used by JavaScript projects to install dependencies.

- Koculu yanked his source code because, we're told, one of the modules was called Kik and that apparently attracted the attention of lawyers representing the instant-messaging app of the same name.

- According to Koculu, Kik's briefs told him to take down the module, he refused, so the lawyers went to NPM's admins claiming brand infringement.

- With left-pad removed from NPM, these applications and widely used bits of open-source infrastructure were unable to obtain the dependency, and thus fell over.

## iOS forensics experts theory: FBI will hack shooters phone by mirroring storage

- method called NAND mirroring

- technique involves copying the contents of the phone's flash memory through a process referred to as NAND mirroring

- This would require desoldering and removing the NAND flash memory chip that acts as the phone's data storage and reading and dumping its contents into a file using a chip reader/programmer

- giving the FBI a backup that can be restored to the chip repeatedly if the phone's security software erases its contents after a number of failed tries.

## Paris terrorists used burner phones, not encryption, to evade detection

- For example: "Security camera footage showed Bilal Hadfi, the youngest of the assailants, as he paced outside the stadium, talking on a cellphone.

- The information come from a 55-page report compiled by the French antiterrorism police for Frances Interior Ministry. Outside the Bataclan theatre venue, the investigators found a Samsung phone in a dustbin: "It had a Belgian SIM card that had been in use only since the day before the attack.

- But rather than trying to avoid discovery by using encryptionwhich would in itself have drawn attention to their accountsthey seem to have stopped using the Internet as a communication channel altogether, and turned to standard cellular network calls on burner phones. That authorities are only now discovering this fact shows how well the strategy worked.

- As Ars has reported, along with other countries the UK government is pushing for ways to circumvent or weaken encryption because it claims strong crypto creates a "safe space" for terrorists.

- The former Ars Technica editor Julian Sanchez wrote on Twitter: "It's suggestive of a verbose boot.

## Tor Project fortifies its software to quickly catch spies

-   There are worries that Tor could either be technically subverted or subject to court orders, which could force the project to turn over critical information that would undermine its security, similar to the standoff between Apple and the U.S. Department of Justice.

-   "Even if a government or a criminal obtains our cryptographic keys, our distributed network and its users would be able to detect this fact and report it to us as a security issue," Perry wrote.

-    Apple is fighting a federal court's order to create a special version of iOS 9 that would remove security protections on an iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino mass shooters.

-   On Monday, the Justice Department indicated it is investigating an alternative method to crack Farook's iPhone, which if successful would not require Apple's assistance.

-   Web browsing traffic is encrypted and routed through random proxy servers, making it harder to figure out the true IP address of a computer.

## BetterCap  Modular, Portable MiTM Framework

-  BetterCAP is a powerful, modular, portable MiTM framework that allows you to perform various types of Man-In-The-Middle attacks against the network.

- It can also help to manipulate HTTP and HTTPS traffic in real-time and much more.  BetterCap has some pretty impressive Spoofing abilities with multiple host discovery (just launch the tool and it will start discovery), ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing and ICMP doubledirect spoofing. The other tool similar to this would be: MITMf  Man-In-The-Middle Attack Framework and specfically for SSL you have sslsniff v0.7  SSL Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Tool. Features Some of the main features include:      Full and half duplex ARP spoofing.     The first real ICMP DoubleDirect spoofing implementation.     Configurable DNS spoofing.     Realtime and completely automatized host discovery.     Realtime credentials harvesting for protocols such as HTTP(S) POSTed data, Basic and Digest Authentications, FTP, IRC, POP, IMAP, SMTP, NTLM ( HTTP, SMB, LDAP, etc ) and more.     Fully customizable network sniffer.     Modular HTTP and HTTPS transparent proxies with support for user plugins + builtin plugins to inject custom HTML code, JS or CSS files and URLs.     SSLStripping with HSTS bypass.     Builtin HTTP server.  Why not Ettercap? Ettercap still has some plus points like you can see connections and raw pcap stuff, but its not all relevant to everyone.

- Mostly its show its age and BetterCap doesnt have the below cons: 

-       Ettercap was a great tool, but its old     Ettercap filters do not work most of the times     Ettercap filters are outdated     Ettercap filters are hard to implement due to the implementation language.     Ettercap is unstable on big networks (try host discovery on a network bigger than /24)     Ettercap is hard to extend or add modules to unless youre a C/C++ developer.     Ettercaps and MITMfs ICMP spoofing is completely useless in 2016.     Ettercap does not provide a builtin and modular HTTP(S) transparent proxy.     Ettercap does not provide a smart and fully customizable credentials sniffer.  You can download BetterCap via the Ruby gem system so:

- gem install bettercapgem update bettercap

## IETF group proposes better SMTP hardening to secure email. At last

- 

- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), that staple of e-mail communications, was born in an era when nobody thought the Internet needed security. While extensions have been written since to fix this  the most important is STARTTLS  there remains a problem: STARTTLS doesn't yet guarantee either message confidentiality or proof of server authenticity.  

- A proposal from experts from some big-name companies aims to fix that. The Internet-Draft document, not yet an RFC, has names from Google, Yahoo!, Comcast, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and German outfit 11 Mail and Media Development and Technology (note: IETF authors aren't necessarily endorsed by their employers; they work as individuals). As they explain: STARTTLS is subject to downgrade attacks, which undermines confidentiality; and because the trust relationship from email domain to MTA server identity is not cryptographically validated, users can't guarantee the authenticity of servers handling their e-mails. Fixing this doesn't need new encryption techniques, but systems need to know each others' capabilities.

- Hence the draft, SMTP Strict Transport Security, which allows recipient domains to tell senders whether they support TLS, how MTAs should validate TLS server certificates, and what senders should do if TLS negotiation fails. Importantly, in the context of an Internet that's got a lot of different systems of wildly varying vintage, SMTP STS supports an incremental rollout. As well as the mechanism for reporting failed crypto negotiations to users,it also features a report-only mode, enabling progressive roll-out and auditing for compliance, the document says. While another proposal, DANE, offers similar capabilities, it depends on DNSSEC, which isn't required by the latest draft. SMTP STS, on the other hand, uses the certificate authority (CA) system, combined with a trust-on-first-use (TOFU) approach to avoid interception (that is, a model that prompts the user to accept credentials the first time a server is encountered). SMTP STS can, the document notes, be used with DANE, in which case users and sysadmins get the benefits of failure reporting. The key components of policies are version (naturally enough), the TLS-Only field that stipulates messages can only be delivered to secure message transfer agents (MTAs); MX patterns; authentication mechanisms; recipient MX constraints; policy lifetime; and reply-to address. Under "future work" the authors list possibilities like certificate pinning, policy distribution mechanisms, receive-from restrictions, and restricting cipher and TLS versions.

## 1.5M Verizon Enterprise customer records selling on forum after breach

- Some 1.5 million Verizon Enterprise customer records have been stolen and are being sold on a criminal hacking forum, according to reports. A trusted seller on a popular but shadowy unnamed criminal forum asked for US$100,000 for the database or US$10,000 for batches of 100,000 records, investigative blogger Brian Krebs reports.  

- Verizon Enterprise counts 99 percent of the Fortune 500 among its customer base. The company has been contacted for comment. Verizon told Krebs it had found and fixed a vulnerability in its enterprise client portal and is contacting customers. Our investigation to date found an attacker obtained basic contact information on a number of our enterprise customers.

- No customer proprietary network information or other data was accessed or accessible, the company says. The unnamed seller is also reportedly selling vulnerabilities in the Verizon website.

- Buyers will receive the stolen databases in MongoDB format. The information will be useful in crafting personalised, and therefore more enticing, phishing messages, which is a crucial first step in many attacks against enterprises.

## Racist troll says he sent white supremacist flyers to public printers at colleges

- Auernheimer told the New York Times he was behind a wave of racist print jobs that hit universities across the US.pinguino k 

- Public networked printers at a number of universities were part of the target pool of a massive print job sent out by hacker and Internet troll Andrew "Weev" Auernheimer.

- Auernheimer exploited the open nature of university networks to send print jobs to the networked printers, which in some cases were deliberately left open to the Internet to allow faculty and students to print documents remotely.

- Auernheimer took credit for the printouts in an interview with the Times, saying that he had not specifically targeted the universities but had sent the flyer print job to every publicly accessible printer in North America. The Times also reports that an apparent copycat prank printed out anti-LGBT flyers on Monday at Berkeley and Amherst.

- Auernheimer told the Times he was not responsible for that document. In an e-mail to faculty and staff at Stony Brook University, the university's chief information security officer Philip Doesschate acknowledged that the flyer was output by at least one printer at Stony Brook. "Upon being made aware of the situation," Doesschate wrote in the March 27 e-mail, Stony Brook's IT department "applied necessary filters to incoming Internet traffic in order to block these types of messages.

## Names That Break Computers

- Reader Thelasko writes: The BBC has a story about people with names that break computer databases.

- Thelasko compares it to the XKCD comic about Bobby Tables, though it's a real problem that's also been experienced by a Hawaiian woman named Janice Keihanaikukauakahihulihe'ekahaunaele, whose last name exceeds the 36-character limit on state ID cards.

- And in 2010, programmer John Graham-Cumming complained about web sites  (including Yahoo) which refused to accept hyphenated last names.

- Programmer Patrick McKenzie pointed the BBC to a 2011 W3C post highlighting the key issues with names, along with his own list of common mistaken assumptions.

- "They don't necessarily test for the edge cases," McKenzie says, noting that even when filing his own income taxes in Japan, his last name exceeds the number of characters allowed.

## Certified Ethical Hacker website caught spreading crypto ransomware

- For the past four days, including during the hour that this post was being prepared on Thursday morning, a major security certification organization has been spreading TeslaCrypt malwaredespite repeated warnings from outside researchers. EC-Council, the Albuquerque, New Mexico-based professional organization that administers the Certified Ethical Hacker program, started spreading the scourge on Monday.

- Shortly afterward, researchers from security firm Fox IT notified EC-Council officials that one of their subdomainswhich just happens to provide online training for computer security studentshad come under the spell of Angler, a toolkit sold online that provides powerful Web drive-by exploits.

- On Thursday, after receiving no reply and still detecting that the site was infected, Fox IT published this blog post, apparently under the reasonable belief that when attempts to privately inform the company fail, it's reasonable to go public. Like so many drive-by attack campaigns, the one hitting the EC-Council is designed to be vexingly hard for researchers to replicate.

- The EC-Council pages of those who aren't spared then receive embedded code that redirects the browser to a chain of malicious domains that host the Angler exploits. The Fox IT blog post continued: Through this embedding the client is redirected a couple of times to avoid/frustrate/stop manual analysis and some automated systems.

- Once the victims files have been successfully encrypted a ransom note is presented to instruct the victim on ways to recover files: Enlarge TeslaCrypt requires the victim to pay around 1.5 BTC to get their files back; this equals to approximately 622$ at the current conversion rate. The EC-Council infection comes eight days after The New York Times, the BBC, and other big-name Web publishers fell victim to a rash of malicious ads that attempted to surreptitiously install crypto ransomware and other malware on the computers of unsuspecting visitors.

## Apple Introduces Their Answer To The Raspberry Pi

- Following in the tradition of the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and the Intel Edison, Apple have released a single board computer meant for embedded and Internet of Things applications.

- Its not iOS, either; Id compare it to a Chromebook  just enough to do the job, and not much else. User Experience Using the Apple Device is dead simple.

- We do look forward to the eventual hack, root, or exploit that will unlock the powerful graphics capabilities the A8 chip already has. Verdict Right off the bat, the Apple Device is an amazing piece of hardware.

- The ability to just plug it into a computer and have a tiny *nix device connected to the Internet is great, and comparing the user interface to the Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, or any of the Intel offerings isnt even a fair comparison.

- If anyone has seen this connector in the wild, Id love to hear about it in the comments. What Apple has done here is no different from the Raspberry Pi or any of the other ARM-powered single board computers released in recent years.
