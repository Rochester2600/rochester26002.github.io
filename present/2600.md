## GitHub Commits Reveal The Top 'Weekend Programming' Languages

- "Clearly 2016 was a year dedicated to play with functional languages, up and coming paradigms, and scripting 3d worlds," he writes, revealing that the top weekend programming languages are:</i><p><em>Rust, Glsl, D, Haskell, Common Lisp, Kicad, Emacs Lisp, Lua, Scheme, Julia, Elm, Eagle, Racket, Dart, Nsis, Clojure, Kotlin, Elixir, F#, Ocaml</em> </p><p>Earlier this week another data scientist calculated ended up with an entirely different list by <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/02/What-Programming-Languages-Weekends/">counting the frequency of each language's tag in StackOverflow questions</a>.

- But Hoffa's analysis was performed using Google's BigQuery web service, and he's also compiled a list of 2016's <em>least</em> popular weekend languages -- the ones people seem to prefer using at the office rather than in their own free time.

- </p><p><em>Nginx, Matlab, Processing, Vue, Fortran, Visual Basic, Objective-C++, Plsql, Plpgsql, Web Ontology Language, Smarty, Groovy, Batchfile, Objective-C, Powershell, Xslt, Cucumber, Hcl, Puppet, Gcc Machine Description</em> </p><p>What's most interesting is the changes over time.

- In the last year Perl has become more popular than Java, PHP, and ASP as a weekend programming language.

- And Rust "used to be a weekday language," Hoffa writes, but it soon also grew more popular for Saturdays and Sunday.

## Voice Calls May Be Coming To the Amazon Echo and Google Home

- Amazon and Google are interested in adding the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14623374/voice-calls-amazon-echo-google-home-report">ability to make and receive phone calls to their popular home speaker devices</a> -- Echo and Home, reports WSJ, adding that telecom regulations and privacy are some of the things both the companies are tackling.

- If the companies are able to sort out the issues, the feature could make way to the home speaker devices as soon as this year, the paper reported.

- From The Verge:<i> There's also the fact that you would only make calls over speakerphone, which could limit the usefulness of the feature for some users.

- Theoretically, it would be easier for Google to get a phone service up and running on the Home, given that it's been operating Google Voice for seven years and launched Project Fi back in 2015, while Amazon has to start from scratch to get its phone service up and running.

- According to the Journal, Amazon is considering a number of different options, including syncing to the user's existing phone number, call forwarding, or the Echo getting its own phone number.</i><br/></div>

## Internet Backbone Provider Cogent Blocks Pirate Bay and Other 'Pirate' Sites

- Several Pirate Bay users from ISPs all over the world have been unable to access their favorite torrent site for more than a week.

- Their requests are being stopped in the Internet backbone network of Cogent Communications, which has <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/internet-backbone-provider-cogent-blocks-pirate-bay-and-other-pirate-sites-170209/">blackholed the CloudFlare IP-address of The Pirate Bay and many other torrent and streaming sites</a>, reports TorrentFreak.

- From the article:<i> When the average Internet user types in a domain name, a request is sent through a series of networks before it finally reaches the server of the website.

- However, for more than a week now the US-based backbone provider Cogent has stopped passing on traffic to these sites.

- While this can be reached just fine by most people, users attempting to pass requests through Cogent's network are unable to access them.</i><br/></div>

## Apple's iPhone 8 To Replace Touch ID Home Button With 'Function Area'

- Adding detail to his previous predictions regarding the next-generation handset, Kuo in a note to investors obtained by AppleInsider said the full-screen design will allow Apple to integrate a "function" area never seen in an iPhone.

- While Kuo failed to elaborate on an exact implementation, the note suggests Apple plans to hardcode a set of always-on, static system controls into iOS.

- With the deletion of current Touch ID technology, Kuo believes "iPhone 8" will incorporate new bio-recognition assets to take over device security and Apple Pay authentication duties.

- The analyst did not offer predictions on the type of biometric tech Apple intends to use, but a report earlier today said the company could integrate a 3D laser scanning module capable of facilitating facial recognition and augmented reality applications.

- Kuo in a note <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/01/21/apple-expected-to-replace-touch-id-with-two-step-facial-fingerprint-bio-recognition-tech">last month</a> said Apple might integrate a dual biometric system utilizing optical fingerprint readers and facial recognition hardware.</i><br/></div>

## As Microsoft touts Windows Insider for biz, let's take a look at W10's broken 2FA logins

- Redmond says: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2><div id="body"><p>For months now, the Windows 10 Anniversary Update has broken two-factor logins using certain smart cards – and Microsoft has refused to discuss it.</p><p>According to <i>Reg</i> readers writing in, and W10 users on support forums, folks who have Yubikey two-factor authentication gadgets have been hitting frustrating error messages when trying to log in with the latest flavor of Windows 10.

- The cards still work on earlier editions of Windows, and users running bleeding-edge Windows Insider builds say their cards now work.</p><p>Other users report speaking with Yubikey support staffers on this issue, only to be told the problem was on Microsoft's end – and that there was no timetable for it to be fixed.</p><p>Despite this issue having been reported on for several months now, Redmond is keeping quiet.

- A couple of hours later, just as we were going to press, a spokesperson for the security hardware biz got in touch to say a hotfix <i>is</i> available to address the problem.

- Folks can test drive the code, and send feedback to Redmond's product managers.</p><p>And soon, Microsoft's <a href="https://insider.windows.com/home/itpro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Insider for IT Professionals</a> program will let corporate techies test out upcoming versions of Windows 10 within enterprise environments before the new builds are released, (presumably so sysadmins can check in advance for things like whether an update breaks Yubikey authentication).</p><p>"The Windows Insider Program recognizes IT Professionals as a critical asset to any organization," purrs Microsoft in its pitch to the industry.</p><p>"From managing complex environments that incorporate Microsoft systems, to managing how they integrate with other applications inside their organization, IT Professionals understand ‘mission critical’ and know how to think through and resolve deployment issues.

- "</p><p>The program will encourage IT pros to share advice among themselves on testing Windows 10 Insider builds on work systems; to vote on which bugs should be prioritized for fixes; to give feedback on how the operating system copes with business workflows; and to open a channel of comms between sysadmins and the Windows team.

## Crypto-curious? Wickr's opened its kimono for code review

- <h2 class="standfirst">Look, don't copy: 'this is not an open source license'</h2><div id="body"><p>Ephemeral messaging application Wickr has opened up the core crypto software of its Wickr Professional app so others can review it.</p><p>The repository is at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WickrInc/wickr-crypto-c">GitHub</a>.</p><p>At this stage, the company is <i>not</i> offering the code for re-use.

- It's published under a purpose-written <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WickrInc/wickr-crypto-c/blob/master/LICENSE">“review license” only</a>, although the company says an open-source release under the GNU licence is on the cards.</p><p>So what's in the box, so to speak?</p><p>To avoid single-library dependencies, the company says it's organised Wickr Professional to expose its security primitives in an “organised and generic” way.</p><p>In other words, while the app uses OpenSSL 1.0.2, other libraries could be supported.

- Supported OpenSSL primitives include AES 256 (GCM and CTR); SHA from 256 to 512; various elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman flavours; SCRYPT and BCRYPT; HMAC (keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code) and HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF).</p><p>As described in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wickr.com/wickr-messaging-protocol">this white paper</a>, the protocol provides:</p><div> <ul><li>End to End Encryption – Messages and encryption keys are available only within Wickr applications and are not disclosed to network attackers or Wickr server operators;</li> <li>Perfect Forward Secrecy – Old message content is not compromised if the long-term key of a user or device is compromised.

- Backward secrecy is also provided against passive adversaries; and</li> <li>Protection of Metadata - Node identity information stored in message headers is hidden from attackers who lack message context and source information.</li> </ul></div><p>As well as the crypto module, the other key pieces of the application's architecture are the protocol itself (the low-level implementation that encodes and decodes encrypted messages); and “Context”.</p><p>Context provides, as Wickr explains, a “high level interface for managing an endpoint that can send and receive encrypted message packets” – which is how client front-ends integrate with the crypto library.</p><p>The protocol is also extensible, so in the future it could support non-text file content like file transfers, audio, and video.</p><p>Announcing the publication of the software, CEO Joel Wallenstrom adds that Wickr has added Austrian crypto-boffin Joël Alwen (of that country's Institute of Science and Technology) to its team.

- Alwen first came to <i>El Reg's</i> attention more than a decade ago, when worked with an Electronic Frontiers Foundation team to decode the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/20/outlaw_printer_dots/">dot-patterns</a> that identified laser printers for spooks.</p><p>Wallenstrom says both the crypto source code and the white paper have already had an independent review: “I want to thank Whitfield Diffie, Paul Kocher, Dan Kaminsky, Adam Shostack, Scott Stender, and Jesse Burns for their insightful feedback and invaluable advice.”</p><p>Wickr's not the first secure messaging app to allow this kind of review: rival Signal released its code <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/23/open_whisper_publishes_endtoend_security_specs/">in November 2016</a>.

## Important Announcement Zerocoin implementation bug

- A typographical error on a<strong> single additional character in code</strong> allowed an attacker to create Zerocoin spend transactions without a corresponding mint.

- We urge all pools and exchanges to update once the release is out.</p> <p>From what we can see, the attacker (or attackers) is very sophisticated and from our investigations, he (or she) did many things to camouflage his tracks through the generation of lots of exchange accounts and carefully spread out deposits and withdrawals over several weeks.

- In other words, the damage has already been mostly absorbed by the markets.</p> <p>To clarify a few things:</p> <ul><li><strong>The exploit happened due to the bug in the code and not from any weakness in the cryptography.</strong> The bug  from the typo error allowed the attacker to reuse his existing valid proofs to generate additional Zerocoin spend transactions.</li> <li><strong>The anonymity of Zerocoin has not been compromised.</strong> We knew we were being attacked when we saw that the total mint transactions did not match up with the total spend transactions.

- </strong>Trading will resume once pools and exchanges have had time to update their code.

- A new release will be pushed out pretty soon.</p> <p>Prior to this announcement we had disclosed the hack to the exchanges for them to assist in our investigations.

- According to the Zcoin team, one extra character left inside Zerocoin's source code was the cause of the bug.

- The hacker exploited the bugs for weeks, by initiating a transaction and receiving the money many times over.</i><p>"According to the Zcoin team, the attacker (or attackers) was very sophisticated and took great care to hide his tracks," reports the site.

- The Zcoin team says they worked with various exchanges to attempt and identify the attacker but to no avail.

## Republicans send anti-Signal signal to US EPA

- <h2 class="standfirst">Resistance is futile as probe demanded into environment agency staffers</h2><div id="body"><p>US House Republicans Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Darin LaHood (R-IL) have demanded a probe into staff at the US Environmental Protection Agency who are apparently using private encrypted communications.</p><p>Earlier this month, insiders at the EPA, the US Department of Labor, the Foreign Service, and possibly other agencies and departments, have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/federal-workers-signal-app-234510">reportedly</a> resorted to strong end-to-end encrypted messengers such as <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://whispersystems.org/">Signal</a> to coordinate their resistance response to the Trump administration.</p><p>Their fear is that a discussion along the lines of “what do we do if we're given an illegal order” on official channels will draw reprisals.</p><p>However, American government communications are subject to freedom of information laws, and that’s sparked the Smith-LaHood letter [<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/02.14.2017%20SST%20to%20EPA%20OIG%20re%20Encrypted%20Communications.pdf">PDF</a>] to the US EPA's watchdog – its inspector general.</p><p>Suggesting that “approximately a dozen” EPA officials are using Signal to “discuss potential strategies” to preserve Obama Administration priorities, the letter says this avoids federal records requirements and circumvents monitoring.

- Smith is the chairman of the US House Committee on Space, Science and Technology, and LaHood is chairman of the subcommittee on oversight.

- They both want a review into the EPA's internal practices.</p><p>“In this instance, the committee is concerned that these encrypted and off-the-record communication practices, if true, run afoul of federal record-keeping requirements, leaving information that could be responsive to future Freedom of Information Act and congressional requests unattainable,” the letter, dated February 14, states.</p><p>Yesterday, House Rep Matt Gaetz (R-FL) introduced <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/861">a one-line bill</a> to terminate the EPA at the end of 2018.

- He also cosponsored a similar bill to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/899/cosponsors">shut down</a> the US Department of Education.

- Both bills are in their early stages of development.</p><p>If the rumors of Signal use are true, other agencies will most likely face similar encrypted comms probes by their overseers.

## Linus Torvalds: Talk of Tech Innovation is Bullshit. Shut Up and Get the Work Done

- Linus Torvalds believes the technology industry's celebration of innovation is smug, self-congratulatory, and self-serving.

- From a report on The Register:<i> The term of art he used was more blunt: "<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/15/think_different_shut_up_and_work_harder_says_linus_torvalds/">The innovation the industry talks about so much is bullshit</a>," he said.

- In a deferential interview at the Open Source Leadership Summit in California on Wednesday, conducted by Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, Torvalds discussed how he has managed the development of the Linux kernel and his attitude toward work.

- "All that hype is not where the real work is," said Torvalds.

- Torvalds said he subscribes to the view that successful projects are 99 per cent perspiration, and one per cent innovation.</i><br/></div>

- <a href="https://linux.slashdot.org/~prisoninmate">prisoninmate</a> quotes a report from Softpedia: <i>A year ago, we told you that, after ten long years, the Debian Project finally found a way to <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/debian-is-switching-to-mozilla-firefox-after-a-decade-of-using-iceweasel-501647.shtml">switch their rebranded Iceweasel web browser back to Mozilla Firefox</a>, both the ESR (Extended Support Release) and normal versions, but one question remained: what about the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> email, news, and calendar client?

- Well, that question has an official answer today, as the Mozilla Thunderbird packages <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/mozilla-thunderbird-email-client-finally-makes-its-way-back-into-debian-s-repos-513059.shtml">appear to have landed in the Debian repositories</a> as a replacement for <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/icedove">Icedove</a>, the rebranded version that Debian Project was forced to use for more than ten years due to trademark issues.

- We also renamed other related packages to use official names, e.g. iceowl-extension -&gt; lightning.

- For now, we need testers to catch existing issues and things we haven't seen until now," said Christoph Goehre in the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/02/msg00004.html">mailing list announcement</a>.

- You can find out how to migrate your Icedove profiles to Thunderbird via Softpedia's report.<br/></div>

## Crypto-curious? Wickr's opened its kimono for code review

- <h2 class="standfirst">Look, don't copy: 'this is not an open source license'</h2><div id="body"><p>Ephemeral messaging application Wickr has opened up the core crypto software of its Wickr Professional app so others can review it.</p><p>The repository is at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WickrInc/wickr-crypto-c">GitHub</a>.</p><p>At this stage, the company is <i>not</i> offering the code for re-use.

- Supported OpenSSL primitives include AES 256 (GCM and CTR); SHA from 256 to 512; various elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman flavours; SCRYPT and BCRYPT; HMAC (keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code) and HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF).</p><p>As described in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wickr.com/wickr-messaging-protocol">this white paper</a>, the protocol provides:</p><div> <ul><li>End to End Encryption – Messages and encryption keys are available only within Wickr applications and are not disclosed to network attackers or Wickr server operators;</li> <li>Perfect Forward Secrecy – Old message content is not compromised if the long-term key of a user or device is compromised.

- Alwen first came to <i>El Reg's</i> attention more than a decade ago, when worked with an Electronic Frontiers Foundation team to decode the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/20/outlaw_printer_dots/">dot-patterns</a> that identified laser printers for spooks.</p><p>Wallenstrom says both the crypto source code and the white paper have already had an independent review: “I want to thank Whitfield Diffie, Paul Kocher, Dan Kaminsky, Adam Shostack, Scott Stender, and Jesse Burns for their insightful feedback and invaluable advice.”</p><p>Wickr's not the first secure messaging app to allow this kind of review: rival Signal released its code <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/23/open_whisper_publishes_endtoend_security_specs/">in November 2016</a>.

## Chrome 57 Will Permanently Enable DRM

- The new version of Chrome will also eliminate the “chrome://plugins” internal URL, which means if you want to disable Flash, you’ll have to do it from the Settings page.</p> <h3>How EME Brought Mandatory DRM On The Web</h3> <p><a href="http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/w3c-refuses-protection-security-researchers,news-53945.html" target="_blank">EME</a> (Encrypted Media Extensions) is an HTML specification which allows DRM plugins to encrypt web content.

- The specification was <a href="https://w3c.github.io/encrypted-media/" target="_blank">proposed</a> by Netflix, as well as by Google and Microsoft.</p> <p>The main positive feature of EME was supposed to be that internet users will be able to see more Hollywood content without any plugins, such as Silverlight or Flash, on the web.

- That means malicious hackers, who already engage in other criminal activities, may freely take advantage of all the vulnerabilities they find in these DRM plugins before companies discover them on their own.</p> <p>Beyond the plugin issue, there may also be an oligopoly issue, because the content market will depend on four, and perhaps soon only three, major DRM services players: Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

- PDF readers, including the ones that are built into browsers, are major targets for malicious hackers.

- However, as the team behind it works to significantly improve its security and performance this year, and as Chrome keeps using its large market share to enable user restrictions, Firefox may start to be used more by technology enthusiasts and their friends.</p>            <p><em>This article appears to continue on subsequent pages which we could not extract</em></p>

## RSA Conference Attendees Get Hacked

- The RSA Conference "is perhaps the world's largest security event, but that doesn't mean that it's necessarily a secure event," reports eSecurityPlanet.

- Scanning the conference floor revealed rogue access points posing as known and trusted networks, according to security testing vendor Pwnie Express.

- <a href="https://it.slashdot.org/~storagedude">storagedude</a> writes: <i>What's worse, several attendees <a href="http://www.esecurityplanet.com/hackers/rsa-conference-wifi-users-under-attack.html">fell for these dummy Wi-Fi services that spoof well-known brands like Starbucks</a>.

- The company also found a number of access points using outdated WEP encryption.

- So much for security pros...</i> <br/> At least two people stayed connected to a rogue network for more than a day, according to the article, and Pownie Express is reminding these security pros that connecting to a rogue network means "the attacker <a href="https://www.pwnieexpress.com/blog/evilap-practical-example">has full control of all information going into and out of the device</a>, and can deploy various tools to modify or monitor the victim's communication.

## As Microsoft touts Windows Insider for biz, let's take a look at W10's broken 2FA logins

- Redmond says: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2><div id="body"><p>For months now, the Windows 10 Anniversary Update has broken two-factor logins using certain smart cards – and Microsoft has refused to discuss it.</p><p>According to <i>Reg</i> readers writing in, and W10 users on support forums, folks who have Yubikey two-factor authentication gadgets have been hitting frustrating error messages when trying to log in with the latest flavor of Windows 10.

- The cards still work on earlier editions of Windows, and users running bleeding-edge Windows Insider builds say their cards now work.</p><p>Other users report speaking with Yubikey support staffers on this issue, only to be told the problem was on Microsoft's end – and that there was no timetable for it to be fixed.</p><p>Despite this issue having been reported on for several months now, Redmond is keeping quiet.

- A couple of hours later, just as we were going to press, a spokesperson for the security hardware biz got in touch to say a hotfix <i>is</i> available to address the problem.

- Folks can test drive the code, and send feedback to Redmond's product managers.</p><p>And soon, Microsoft's <a href="https://insider.windows.com/home/itpro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Insider for IT Professionals</a> program will let corporate techies test out upcoming versions of Windows 10 within enterprise environments before the new builds are released, (presumably so sysadmins can check in advance for things like whether an update breaks Yubikey authentication).</p><p>"The Windows Insider Program recognizes IT Professionals as a critical asset to any organization," purrs Microsoft in its pitch to the industry.</p><p>"From managing complex environments that incorporate Microsoft systems, to managing how they integrate with other applications inside their organization, IT Professionals understand ‘mission critical’ and know how to think through and resolve deployment issues.

- "</p><p>The program will encourage IT pros to share advice among themselves on testing Windows 10 Insider builds on work systems; to vote on which bugs should be prioritized for fixes; to give feedback on how the operating system copes with business workflows; and to open a channel of comms between sysadmins and the Windows team.

## Google claims ‘massive’ Stagefright Android bug had 'sod all effect'

- In that case, 99 per cent of Android devices were vulnerable, but exploits abusing the security blunder peaked at less than eight infections per million users, it was claimed.

- This affected 82 per cent of Android users but exploits peaked at one infection per million users after the details were released, and none before that, we're told.</p><p>Ludwig said he was sure of his figures, due to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2812853?hl=en">malware-detection routines</a>, dubbed Verify Apps, in Google Play services, which is installed on more than 1.4 billion Android handhelds.

- Verify Apps reports back to Google when a software nasty is spotted on the device, allowing the web giant to tot up infection tallies.</p><p>So, basically, Ludwig's claims and figures cover devices with Google Play services installed – Chinese and Amazon Android-based gadgets don't include this software and thus aren't part of the Googler's numbers.</p><p>It also fitted a pattern he had noticed, that there isn't really any complex malware out there in the wild infecting Android devices.

- Software nasties tend to be sleazy apps, installed by punters, that do unpleasant things in the background, rather than malicious code that silently infects devices via webpages, text messages, and so on.</p><p>“Most of the abuse we get isn’t interesting from a security perspective,” he said.

- Even if malware is installed it seldom involved privilege escalation, it primarily just downloads other apps.”</p><p>The same thing seems to be happening in Apple's iOS world, too, he said.

## Republicans send anti-Signal signal to US EPA

- <h2 class="standfirst">Resistance is futile as probe demanded into environment agency staffers</h2><div id="body"><p>US House Republicans Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Darin LaHood (R-IL) have demanded a probe into staff at the US Environmental Protection Agency who are apparently using private encrypted communications.</p><p>Earlier this month, insiders at the EPA, the US Department of Labor, the Foreign Service, and possibly other agencies and departments, have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/federal-workers-signal-app-234510">reportedly</a> resorted to strong end-to-end encrypted messengers such as <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://whispersystems.org/">Signal</a> to coordinate their resistance response to the Trump administration.</p><p>Their fear is that a discussion along the lines of “what do we do if we're given an illegal order” on official channels will draw reprisals.</p><p>However, American government communications are subject to freedom of information laws, and that’s sparked the Smith-LaHood letter [<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/02.14.2017%20SST%20to%20EPA%20OIG%20re%20Encrypted%20Communications.pdf">PDF</a>] to the US EPA's watchdog – its inspector general.</p><p>Suggesting that “approximately a dozen” EPA officials are using Signal to “discuss potential strategies” to preserve Obama Administration priorities, the letter says this avoids federal records requirements and circumvents monitoring.

- Smith is the chairman of the US House Committee on Space, Science and Technology, and LaHood is chairman of the subcommittee on oversight.

- They both want a review into the EPA's internal practices.</p><p>“In this instance, the committee is concerned that these encrypted and off-the-record communication practices, if true, run afoul of federal record-keeping requirements, leaving information that could be responsive to future Freedom of Information Act and congressional requests unattainable,” the letter, dated February 14, states.</p><p>Yesterday, House Rep Matt Gaetz (R-FL) introduced <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/861">a one-line bill</a> to terminate the EPA at the end of 2018.

- He also cosponsored a similar bill to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/899/cosponsors">shut down</a> the US Department of Education.

- Both bills are in their early stages of development.</p><p>If the rumors of Signal use are true, other agencies will most likely face similar encrypted comms probes by their overseers.
