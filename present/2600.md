## FAUXTRIBUTION?

- A group calling itself the Guardians of Peace claimed

- the intrusion into SPEs network consisted of the deployment of destructive malware and the theft of proprietary information as well as employees personally identifiable information and confidential communications

- attacks also rendered thousands of SPEs computers inoperable

- the FBI now has enough information to conclude that the North Korean government is responsible for these actions

- malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed

- significant overlap between the infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea

- the tools used in the SPE attack have similarities to a cyber attack in March of last year against South Korean banks and media outlets, which was carried out by North Korea

## Mathematicians Make a Major Discovery About Prime Numbers | WIRED

- mathematicians have made the first substantial progress in 76 years

- How far apart can consecutive primes be

- The average spacing between primes approaches infinity as you travel up the number line, but in any finite list of numbers, the biggest prime gap could be much larger than the average

- No one has been able to establish how large these gaps can be

- In 1985, Tao, then a 10-year-old prodigy, met Erdos at a math event

- So thats kind of cool.

## Keurig 2.0 Authentication Bypass

- Keurig 2.0 Coffee Maker contains a vulnerability in which the authenticity
of coffee pods, known as K-Cups, uses weak verification methods, which are
subject to a spoofing attack through re-use of a previously verified K-Cup.

- CVSS Base Score: 4.9

- Impact Subscore: 6.9

- Exploitability Subscore: 3.9

## Neohapsis Announcement

- Today, we are excited to announce plans to join Cisco

- Because of Neohapsis and Ciscos shared focus on the Internet of Everything, the opportunity to do groundbreaking work together is enormous

- what we bring to enterprise customers, IoT device manufacturers, and associated service providers will be unique in the market.

## Yik Yak MITM Hack (Give the Dog a Bone)

- Yik Yak, heres the run down. Its kind of like Twitter, but your messages are only shared with people who are currently within a few miles of you. Also, your account is supposed to be totally anonymous

- Yik Yak authenticates users based solely on a user ID. There are no passwords

- Yik Yak happens to make a call to an analytics tool called Flurry every time the app is fired. Flurry needs a way to track the users for Yik Yak, so of course the Yik Yak App tells Flurry the users ID

- Flurry disables HTTPS by default,

- The Android app is programmed to ignore bad SSL certificates.

## Keeping it together with Trello

- for all of us to know what projects are underway at Interlock

- Having an easy mechanism to jot down ideas, track the progress of projects, and collaborate with others is helping us be more effective and creative already, and the detailed records of a project evolving should help us blog with more regularly!

- browse our public projects board to see what were up

## Git thee behind me, Git crit security bug!

- GitHub has acknowledged theres a flaw in its client software and recommended that users upgrade as soon as possible.

- An attacker can craft a malicious Git tree that will cause Git to overwrite its own .git/config file when cloning or checking out a repository, leading to arbitrary command execution in the client machine

- Linux clients are not affected if they run in a case-sensitive filesystem

- Git clients running on OS X (HFS+) or any version of Microsoft Windows (NTFS, FAT) are exploitable through this vulnerability

- repositories hosted on github.com cannot contain any of the malicious trees that trigger the vulnerability

[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/12/19/git_thee_gone_bug_bites_github_clients/](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/12/19/git_thee_gone_bug_bites_github_clients/)

## Linux 'GRINCH' vuln is AWFUL. Except, er, maybe it isn't

- A dispute has arisen about the seriousness of a vulnerability in Linux, dubbed Grinch, that supposedly creates a privilege escalation risk

- the Linux authorisation system, which can unintentionally allow privilege escalation, granting a user root

- The scope of this vulnerability is very limited. Grinch is not remotely exploitable; it requires that an attacker have physical access the server they want to attack.

- In addition, the attacker must already have access to an account in the wheel group (i.e., already have elevated privileges as local administrators), polkit [toolkit for privilege authorisation] must be installed, and the PackageKit package management system must be in use.

- The barriers to exploitation are significant; in a very real way to exploit this flaw you must already have very high levels of access, making exploiting this vulnerability unnecessary.

- Red Hat dismisses the flaw entirely as expected behavior.

- An independent researcher first posted about the vulnerability  which he called PackageKit Privilege Escalation  almost a month ago before Alert Logic picked up on the threat and publicised it.

- The bug was named after the famous Dr Seuss character, since it supposedly carries the potential to ruin the season of network administrators

## Researchers Discover SS7 Flaw, Allowing Total Access To Any Cell Phone, Anywhere

- Researchers discovered security flaws in SS7 that allow listening to private phone calls and intercepting text messages on a potentially massive scale

- even when cellular networks are using the most advanced encryption now available

- to be reported at a hacker conference in Hamburg this month

- functions built into SS7 for other purposes  such as keeping calls connected as users speed down highways, switching from cell tower to cell tower  that hackers can repurpose for surveillance because of the lax security on the network

- It is thought that these flaws were used for bugging German Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone

- can locate callers anywhere in the world, listen to calls as they happen or record hundreds of encrypted calls and texts at a time for later decryption

- There is also potential to defraud users and cellular carriers by using SS7 functions

## Top Security Features Added to Android Lollipop

- Kill switch

- To aid corporate and personal users dealing with stolen devices, the personal data stored within the device can now be remotely wiped and the phone made inoperable

- Encryption on the fly

- Lollipop is default encryption

- Improved malware protection and sandboxing

- SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux), which aims to provide enhanced protection against malware and vulnerabilities. This feature ensures secure app isolation, which helps to keep private data secure should the device be compromised.

- Smart Device Lock

- Smart Lock adds the ability to set trusted locations such as home or the office, where your device will open automatically once you enter that region. You can do the same in conjunction with specific Bluetooth and NFC enabled Android Wear smart watches.

- Multiple User Profiles

- Users can create a different guest profile which has limited access

## pyllyukko/user.js

- This is a user.js configuration file for Mozilla Firefox thats supposed to harden Firefoxs settings and make it more secure.

- Limit the possibilities to track the user through web analytics

- Harden the browser, so it doesnt spill its guts when asked (have you seen what BeEF can do?)

- Limit the browser from storing anything even remotely sensitive persistently (mostly just making sure private browsing is always on)

- Make sure the browser doesnt reveal too much information to shoulder surfers

- Harden the browsers encryption (cipher suites, protocols, trusted CAs)

- Still be at least somewhat usable in daily use

- Just drop the user.js file to your Firefox profile directory at ~/.mozilla/firefox/XXXXXXXX.your_profile_name and verify that the settings are effective from about:config.

## Feds used Adobe Flash to identify Tor users visiting child porn sites

- 16 months ago, word emerged that the FBI exploited a recently patched Firefox vulnerability to unmask Tor users visiting a notorious child pornography site

- It turns out that the feds had waged an even broader uncloaking campaign a year earlier by using a long-abandoned part of the open source Metasploit exploit framework to identify Tor-using suspects

- Omaha defense attorney Joseph Gross challenged the accuracy of evidence it uncovered against a Rochester, New York-based IT worker who claims he was falsely implicated in the campaign

- they even provided a link to the code on Archive.org

## Sony Leaks Reveal Hollywood Is Trying To Break DNS

- leaked documents reveal a frightening line of attack that's currently being considered by the MPAA: What if you simply erased any record that the site was there in the first place?

- the MPAA's lawyers would target the Domain Name System that directs traffic across the internet

- The tactic was first proposed as part of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in 2011

- If a takedown notice could blacklist a site from every available DNS provider, the URL would be effectively erased from the internet. No one's ever tried to issue a takedown notice like that

## Meet FlashFlood, the lightweight script that causes websites to falter

- Dubbed FlashFlood, the looped JavaScript bombards a website with requests in a way that bypasses server defenses designed to protect against crashes

- ttackers could lure unwitting participants into taking part in denial-of-service attacks, through cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or by tricking large numbers of people into visiting an innocuous-looking link

- FlashFlood is particularly potent against heavy database-driven sites if they rely on caching to protect themselves. Many sites running on Drupal are a good example

## Fake Cell Towers Found in Norway

- In yet another example of what happens when you build an insecure communications infrastructure, fake cell phone towers have been found in Oslo

- Remember the rule: were all using the same infrastructure, so we can either keep it insecure so we  and everyone else  can use it to spy, or we can secure it so that no one can use it to spy

## dedis@yale | Dissent: Accountable Anonymous Group Communication

- The Dissent project is a research collaboration between Yale University and UT Austin to create a powerful, practical anonymous group communication system offering strong, provable security guarantees with reasonable efficiency

- Dissent builds on dining cryptographers and verifiable shuffle algorithms to offer provable anonymity guarantees, even in the face of traffic analysis attacks,

- Dissent seeks to offer accountable anonymity

- Dissent can guarantee that each user of an online forum gets exactly one bandwidth share, one vote, or one pseudonym

- Dissent offers an anonymous communication substrate intended primarily for applications built on a broadcast communication model: for example, bulletin boards, wikis, auctions, or voting

## Dining cryptographers problem - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

- In cryptography, the dining cryptographers problem studies how to perform a secure multi-party computation of the boolean-OR function

- Three cryptographers gather around a table for dinner. The waiter informs them that the meal has been paid for by someone, who could be one of the cryptographers or the National Security Agency (NSA). The cryptographers respect each other's right to make an anonymous payment, but want to find out whether the NSA paid

## Censorship 2.0: Shadowy forces controlling online conversations

- In his talk Weapons of Mass Distraction: Sock Puppetry for Fun and Profit

- Haroon and his team demonstrated how they successfully gamed systems ranging from mailing lists, online polls, Twitter and Reddit, to major news sites and comment systems

- More importantly, they also collected forensic evidence that such tampering has already been going on.

- Its the concept of rent-a-crowd, brought to the Internet age using sock puppets  essentially accounts that are created online that dont really represent real people, and are used to sway peoples opinions in forums and other online get-togethers,

## Xiao's Blog: LastPass' attempt at client-side Android encryption with JavaScript: a breakdown

- Overview of how LastPass gets the credentials into a webpage

- User browses to website 'W' in Chrome

- LastPass' Accessibility service get's notified that W is being browsed to. If there are credentials for this site, it displays the usernames to the user (left screenshot below)

- The user picks one

- LastPass' Accessibility service discreetly copies a JavaScript program 'P' to the clipboard then pastes it into the address bar, handily obscured by the instructions to the user (right screenshot below)

- The user follows the prompt and presses 'enter', executing P

- P finds the username/password fields, and fills them out with the credentials

- So how does LastPass put the credentials into P?

- On versions at least as old as 3.2.3 (the latest APK on the LastPass release history page) it simply pasted them in, encoded in Base64:

- So what does the new P do?

- t encrypts the credentials based on the unix time of the request and the website being visited.

- So there you have it. Don't use the LastPass Android app to fill into Chrome; it ain't safe.

## Snowden files show NSA's AURORAGOLD pwned 70% of world's mobile networks

- The mobile tapping system, dubbed AURORAGOLD, successfully cracked 701 of an estimated 985 cellular networks worldwide, according to the leaked NSA presentation released by The Intercept.

- was done by snooping on the private communications of key workers within the industry to capture technical documentation and encryption keys that allowed the agency access to mobile calls

- It was assumed intelligence agencies can break the widely used A5/1 algorithm; now we know GCHQ and the NSA have been working on cracking the supposedly stronger A5/3 used in 3G. For that, the Brits needed a 4m system to attack the cipher by 2012.
