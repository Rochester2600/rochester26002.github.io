## Kaminsky: The internet is germ-ridden and it's time to sterilize it

- Kaminsky has been developing a micro-sandboxing system that spins up small virtual machines (VMs) to carry out sensitive tasks

- Dubbed Autoclave, it limits the ability of the code running in the VM to communicate, and monitors what's going on inside

- IronFrame can be built into a "magic browser," he said, which would allow web designers to build webpages that allow functions in a known safe state.

- Astatica, aims to apply machine learning techniques to information security.

- Astatica ingests information about software vulnerabilities and is trained to spot future insecurities. The system is still in its early stages, and Kaminsky says it could be a major breakthrough in teaching people about computer security.

## Frequent Password Changes Are the Enemy Of Security, FTC Technologist Says

- Why is it that the FTC is going around telling everyone to change their passwords?'

- she said during a keynote speech at the BSides security conference in Las Vegas

- Frequent password changes do little to improve security and very possibly make security worse by encouraging the use of passwords that are more susceptible to cracking

## Pennsylvania To Apply 6% 'Netflix Tax'

- An anonymous reader writes: Governor Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania has signed into law a new revenue package that will require residents to pay a 6% sales tax on their streaming subscriptions.

- AllFlicks reports: "Though the term 'Netflix tax' has become popular, laws like this don't just affect Netflix -- they also affect competitors like Hulu and HBO Now.

- App purchases and ebooks are also affected.

- The government is trying to close that funding gap, and streaming subscribers are being stuck with the bill.

- " Magazine and newspaper subscriptions, as well as digital versions of the Bible, will be exempt from the digital downloads tax, reports CBS Local News in Pittsburgh.

## New attack steals SSNs, e-mail addresses, and more from HTTPS pages

- To determine the size of an HTTPS-protected response, the attacker uses an oracle technique that returns what amounts to a yes-or-no response to each guess

- When a request containing "value=" results in the same data size, the attacker knows that string is inside the encrypted response and then tries to modify the guess to include the next character, say "value=0"

- If that guess results in a larger file size the attacker knows it's wrong and will try "value=1", "value-=2", and so on until the new guess similarly results in a response that shows no increase in file size

- The attacker then tries to guess the next character and repeats the process until the entire token has been recovered.

- Van Goethem said the only mitigation he knows of is to disable the third-party cookies, since responses sent by the HTTPS site are no longer associated with the victim. At the moment, most Web browsers by default enable the receipt of third-party cookies, and some online services don't work unless third-party cookies are allowed.

## Users of secure chat app Telegram popped after likely State attack

- Black Hat An attack group known for rudimentary phishing scams and having operational security so bad their servers were popped by Check Point has compromised a dozen Telegram accounts and gained phone numbers for a further 15 million, possibly with state assistance. Telegram is a well-regarded end-to-end encrypted chat client used by some 100 million users including 20 million of Iran's 77 million residents.  

- Tried-and-tested phone porting scams would be another way to redirect the text messages in order for attackers to add themselves as additional users on targeted Telegram accounts. The "Rocket Kitten" hacking group has previously targeted civilian organisations and academia in Germany and Israel and holds some level of supporting interest in the Iranian state.

- It has compromised Israeli nuclear scientists and physicists, ex-military, Saudi scholars, NATO regional posts, and various media outlets. It is behind hundreds of campaigns, labelled "projects" by the group, cooked up to compromise various targets. It last year targeted organisations and probed security researchers with old-school and largely defunct macro document scams that require users of modern Office installations to click through security warnings to deliberately enable macros.

- Check Point popped the group's servers in November and found what it reckoned was the real identities of two Rocket Kitten members. The operational security blunder meant one group member linked his alias with a real identity, while the entire group had infected their systems with their own malware in what Check Point wonks called an "utter lack of operational security". "If all that wasnt enough, we also managed to retrieve an updated resume for [one of the attackers]," they said at the time. Check Point guessed the group was part of the large contingent of nationalist script kiddies who use scripts and bots to deface thousands of sites every day, and were roped into the world of espionage by Tehran. Researchers Claudio Guarnieri of Amnesty International and independent hacker Collin Anderson suspect Iranian ISPs may have been prevailed upon to assist the attack, the pair told Reuters ahead of their talk at Black Hat Las Vegas. "We have over a dozen cases in which Telegram accounts have been compromised, through ways that sound like basically coordination with the cellphone company," Anderson told the wire service. The verification method is used by almost all IT services including Google and Facebook as a seemingly unshakable trade-off between convenience and security. Compromising SMS is easy for established hackers.

- A target's basic information is all that's required - and often much less - for telecommunications providers to allow all incoming calls and SMS to be redirected to an attacker's phone number. It is useful for capturing two factor authentication codes and bank transfer confirmation when stealing funds. Telcos are notorious for allowing phone porting using information obtainable from most Facebook accounts.

## Popular BitTorrent Search Engine Site Torrentz.eu Mysteriously Disappears

-  Popular BitTorrent Search Engine Site Torrentz.eu Mysteriously Disappears  (softpedia.com) 

- monkeyzoo writes: Softpedia reports that Torrentz.eu, the internet's biggest BitTorrent meta-search engine, has mysteriously and suddenly shut down.

- Visitors of the website see a simple message that reads, "Torrentz was a free, fast and powerful meta-search engine combining results from dozens of search engines."

- Trying to run a search, or clicking any link on the site changes that message to "Torrentz will always love you.

- The reason for the disappearance is mysterious, but there is speculation that Torrentz.eu admins decided to pull the plug on their own and avoid any future legal problems in the wake of increasing legal pressure on The Pirate Bay and the arrests related to KickassTorrents.

## Hacked Bitcoin firm plans to spread losses across all users

- "We are still working out the details so nothing is set in stone, however we are leaning towards a socialized loss scenario among bitcoin balances and active loans to (bitcoin/dollar) positions," the Hong-Kong based company said on its website on Friday.

- Bitfinex revealed it had been hacked on Tuesday and suspended trading, causing prices of the digital currency to fall significantly.

- A total of 119,756 bitcoins, worth $68 million at current prices, were reportedly stolen as a result of a security breach.

- To what degree depends on the devil in the details and what the total capital held by BitFinex is," Hayter told CNBC via email. 

-   "Some users who were not hacked will feel angry at having to stump up their funds to cover shortfalls elsewhere on the exchange.

## Frequent Password Changes is a Bad Security Idea

- Lorrie Cranor, now the FTC's chief technologist, agrees:

- By studying the data, the researchers identified common techniques account holders used when they were required to change passwords.

- "The UNC researchers said if people have to change their passwords every 90 days, they tend to use a pattern and they do what we call a transformation," Cranor explained.

- The researchers used the transformations they uncovered to develop algorithms that were able to predict changes with great accuracy.

- In offline attacks performed on the recovered hashes using superfast computers, 41 percent of the changed passwords were cracked within three seconds.

## Telegram Hack  Possible Nation State Attack By Iran

- Theres 2 vectors of attack at play here, both of which regard Iranian users, but are not connected (other than the attackers probably being the same group).  So the two attacks were related to two totally different parts of the Telegram stack, one being targeted at a small number of user accounts via SMS 2FA and the other being a fairly basic API brute-force for information gathering purposes. Amnesty International technologist and researcher Claudio Guarnieri and independent security researcher Collin Anderson traced recent Telegram account breaches in Iran to the SMS messages Telegram sends to people when they activate a new device.

- Their focus generally revolves around those with an interest in Iran and defense issues, but their activity is absolutely global, says John Hultquist, who manages the cyber espionage intelligence team at the security firm FireEye, of Rocket Kitten.

- In the case of the Telegram attacks, the researchers also suggested that SMS messages may have been compromised by Iranian cell phone companies themselves, an industry that also has potential ties to the government. 

-  So the first part is quite serious, as it means the bad actors can totally hijack the accounts of certain users by receiving the new device activation code via SMS.

- Which they could then choose who to hijack using the SMS authentication message (only 12 users). Which means the gravity of this hack in the media is often overstated. Source: Wired

## How the HTTPS-snooping, email addy and SSN-raiding HEIST JavaScript code works

- fetch('https://myhealthcare.org/myprofile',
{ mode: "no-cors", credentials: "include"});

- This calls fetch(), telling it to hand over the user's credentials  their login cookie so we can continue to log in as them  and to use a standard HTTP GET call to fetch the profile page

- when using HEAD, GET or POST, the JavaScript code is not allowed to see the encrypted page returned by the website

- fetch() is aimed at asynchronous communications: it returns a Promise object that triggers a callback as soon as the first byte is received from the server

- Using performance.getEntries() it is possible to find out when the last byte was received

- So we have a start time and a stop time

- packets of data will have been sent in batches, known as congestion windows, one window at a time, one after the other, with a slight pause at the end of each window for the browser to acknowledge to the server that everything is going OK.

- It is possible, judging from the time taken, to work out if a fetched page fitted inside one or more than one window

- If there's a block of duplicated information on the page, the server sends that block once

- If the HEIST script can send a request to a website knowing that part of the request will appear on the page, it can vary that request to, byte by byte, sniff out the contents of the encrypted page.

- et's say the page being targeted includes an email address, bob@example.com

- we send aaa@example.com and get back, say, 200 bytes of compressed encrypted data

- We next send a combination of addresses until we hit bob@example.com and get back 184 bytes

- The researchers said that the only way to protect against HEIST is to disable third-party cookies, which is an option on most browsers but not enabled by default. Disabling third-party cookies would prevent HEIST's fetch() call from authenticating with the raided webpage.

## Galaxy Note 7 Iris Scanner Explained

- According to the company, the device stores your registered iris information as an encrypted code safely in its hardware using its KNOX security platform

- Whenever you want to access content, such as a protected app, the device first captures your iris pattern for recognition, extracts and digitizes it

- then proceeds to match it with the encrypted code to provide access

- You can be sure that no one else apart from you can access your device in case it is stolen or lost because the Note 7 registers the iris information of only one person

- recognize the reflected images of the irises through an infrared light

- The light emitted from the Galaxy Note 7's display allows the scanner to receive data even in low light environments

- Samsung also plans to partner with major financial institutions to incorporate its iris scanner into mobile banking applications

## There's Now A Cryptocurrency Created by Participating in DDoS Attacks

- But instead of the arbitrary math problems used by Bitcoin and its ilk, DDoSCoin's malicious proof-of-work (which the authors call Proof-of-DDoS) functions by checking the cryptographically-signed responses that a website's server returns whenever a user connects to it

- That way, the system can reward users who prove they've participated in an attack by verifying they've flooded the targeted site with enough requests.

- we have not pushed to actually make it a reality today.

## Conference and Music CD torrents from DEF CON 24!

- The last VR boom mostly created dozens of televised interviews for Jaron Lanier, but right on the edge of that bubble we got 'Lawnmower Man' - a sort of 'Flowers for Algernon' meets 'Transcendence' with some seriously early 90s graphics work.

- If your idea of the perfect evening is the tinkling of ice cubes and ivories under low, flattering lights, join us Friday night at Napoleon's for two shows of the song stylings of Richard Cheese and his crack band Lounge Against the Machine.

- How does an artificial intelligence work around human quirks and resistance to achieve the programmed objective? The Animatrix An interesting short film anthology that delves more directly into the circumstances at play in 'The Matrix'.

- If we make machines that can create on their own, how do we deal with what they make? The Machine A recent (2013) film about British Minstry of Defence cyborgs and what happens when the tech begins to outgrow its narrow intended purpose. 2001 every single time you ear a purring robot voice delivering bad news to increasingly frantic humans, you're seeing an homage to HAL from Stanley Kubrick's immortal (and deeply weird) movie about consciousness, 2001.

- On the surface, it deals with the same kind of 'Terminator'- style battle for supremacy between man and machine, but the focus on the interactions between humans and robots who look just like people but have their own culture, faith and ambitions elevates the storytelling to something more than mere binge worthy genre fiction.

## EquationGroup Tool Leak  ExtraBacon Demo

- The exploits appear to be targeting firewalls, particularly Cisco PIX/ASA, Juniper Netscreen, Fortigate, and more.

- The requirements for the ExtraBacon exploit are that you have SNMP read access to the firewall, as well as access to either telnet or SSH

- The ASA must be running 8.x, up to 8.4(4)

- Once the exploit is successful, the attacker will be able to SSH to or telnet to (depending on what protocol is setup on the FW) without needing to enter credentials

- If an enable password is set, this will still need to be a barrier for managing the firewall, as the exploit does not appear to disable it.

## Tattoos by Robotic Arm With Pinpoint Accuracy

-  Tattoos are an ancient art, and as with most art, is usually the domain of human expertise.

- The delicate touch required takes years to master, but with the capacity for perfect accuracy and precision movements, enlisting a robotic arm and some clever software to tattoo a willing canvas is one step closer thanks to the efforts of [Pierre Emm] and [Johan da Silveira]. They began by using a 3D printer modified to print with a tattoo needle.

- Catching the interest of the Applied Research Lab at Autodesk, the next logical step was to use an industrial robot arm get a human under the tattooing machine  dubbed Tatoue  after scanning the limb in question and loading it into Dynamo, their parametric design environment to map the design onto the virtual limb.

-  [Pierre] put his leg on the line with the help of the handymans secret weapon to demonstrate Tatoues potential for some heavy metal ink.

- If you want a less permanent alternative to some robot art, a 3D printer can still sketch some impressive pieces. [via Itay Ramot and Gizmodo]

## Forensics tool nabs data from Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp

- The tool, dubbed Retroscope, recovered data from up to the previous 11 screens displayed from up to 15 apps, with an average of five screens pulled from each.

- Apps included Signal, Skype, WeChat, Gmail, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram running on a Samsung S4, LG G3, and HTC One.

- The lead author says he was "amazed" by the lack of in-memory app data protection reckoning that information should be "shredded" after it is displayed.

- Writing over expired screens will impact smartphone performance however and the team did not find an easy way to counter their forensic data extraction methods.

## POS malware stings 20 US hotels

- 

- Another 20 US hotels have been identified as being infected with point-of-sale malware earlier this year. The dozen affected hotels are run by HEI Hotels  Resorts and bear the Starwood, Westin, Marriott International, Hyatt and InterContinental brands.  

-  

- The chain says the malware campaign ran as far back as March 2015, with fourteen hotels affected after December 2, and didn't end until June 21 of this year. According to Reuters, card data from tens of thousands of transactions could be at risk; HEI is still working out how many individual customers might have their names, card numbers, card expiry dates, and CCV numbers compromised. The infected systems were used in restaurants, bars, spas, shops and other facilities. It's been a horror month for the hospitality sector, which is scrambling to respond to the high-profile Oracle MICROS vulnerability. Since acquiring MICROS, Oracle has consigned much of that company's media release history to the memory hole, but Hyatt was touted as a MICROS customer in 2003, and Marriott signed with the company in 2013.

- ) # Specify the vulnerable SSL v3 protocol to talk to an outdated server: $ http --ssl=ssl3 https://vulnerable.example.org

- For example, the following request sends the verbatim contents of that XML file with Content-Type: application/xml: $ http PUT httpbin.org/put @/data/file.xml

- You can choose your preferred color scheme via the --style option if you don't like the default one (see $ http --help for the possible values). Also, the following formatting is applied:  HTTP headers are sorted by name. JSON data is indented, sorted by keys, and unicode escapes are converted to the characters they represent.  One of these options can be used to control output processing:

- If the guessed filename already exists, HTTPie adds a unique suffix to it. You can also redirect the response body to another program while the response headers and progress are still shown in the terminal: $ http -d https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie/archive/master.tar.gz |  tar zxf - If --output, -o is specified, you can resume a partial download using the --continue, -c option.

- However, when is applied, the whole response is buffered and only then processed at once. You can use the --stream, -S flag to make two things happen:  The output is flushed in much smaller chunks without any buffering, which makes HTTPie behave kind of like tail -f for URLs. Streaming becomes enabled even when the output is prettified: It will be applied to each line of the response and flushed immediately.

## Bungling Microsoft singlehandedly proves that golden backdoor keys are a terrible idea

- Microsoft leaked the golden keys that unlock Windows-powered tablets, phones and other devices sealed by Secure Boot

- when Secure Boot is fully enabled in the firmware of a Microsoft device, it will only boot up an operating system that is cryptographically signed by Redmond

- Now that golden policy has leaked onto the internet. It is signed by Microsoft's Windows Production PCA 2011 key. If you provision this onto your device or computer as an active policy, you'll disable Secure Boot. The policy is universal; it is not tied to any particular architecture or device. It works on x86 and ARM, on anything that uses the Windows boot manager.

## Copperhead OS: The startup that wants to solve Androids woeful security

-  A startup on a shoestring budget is working to clean up the Android security mess, and has even demonstrated results where other "secure" Android phones have failed, raising questions about Google's willingness to address the widespread vulnerabilities that exist in the world's most popular mobile operating system. "Copperhead is probably the most exciting thing happening in the world of Android security today," Chris Soghoian, principal technologist with the Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, tells Ars.

- "The Apple team almost always picked the more secure path to go and has found a way to overcome all these performance and user experience issues.

- The company could, he points out, demand that OEMs implement default full-disk encryption as part of the Android and Play Service licence terms.

- "Given our experience with that research and implementation on ARM, I'm not inclined to do more free work for the full-time funded upstream or multi-billion dollar corporations to rip off.

- " Given the dramatic security benefits porting Grsecurity to Android would bring, and the relatively low cost of such work, Soghoian wonders why no one is paying Spengler and Micay to do so. Is Android critical infrastructure? "In an ideal world, the US Department of Homeland Security would write a check to Spengler for $5 million and keep him busy," Soghoian says, pointing to the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII), founded after Heartbleed to take better care of critical open source security software like OpenSSL. Because the Grsecurity project has the potential to positively benefit every Linux user on the planetincluding servers, desktops, and more than a billion Android usersSoghoian argues that the project is the kind of thing the CII should be funding. "The White House announced they were going to put more money into the open source community a few months ago," he says.

## Linux bug leaves USA Today, other top sites vulnerable to serious hijacking attacks

- By contrast, the Linux operating system kernel, starting with version 3.6 introduced in 2012, has added a largely complete set of functions implementing the standard.

- Linux kernel maintainers released a fix with version 4.7 almost three weeks ago, but the patch has not yet been applied to most mainstream distributions.

- This can have serious implications on the security and privacy of the Internet at large. The root cause of the vulnerability is the introduction of the challenge ACK responses and the global rate limit imposed on certain TCP control packets.

- At a very high level, the vulnerability allows an attacker to create contention on a shared resource, i.e., the global rate limit counter on the target system by sending spoofed packets.

- The Tor attack could be particularly effective if it knocked out properly functioning exit nodes because the technique would increase the chances that connections would instead use any malicious exit nodes that may exist. "In general, we believe that a DoS attack against Tor connections can have a devastating impact on both the availability of the service as a whole and the privacy guarantees that it can provide," the researchers wrote.

## Guccifer 2.0 doxes hundreds of House Democrats with massive document dump

- What's more, the release of so much personal information belonging to Democratic representatives will undoubtedly force some of the party's most influential members to change their phone numbers and e-mail addresses when they're needed most. Several security firms who have analyzed the software used in the DNC hack say it bears the hallmark of two competing groups within the Russian government.

- Some analysts claimed the leak was designed to divide the Democratic vote and benefit Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has voiced support for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

- Some analysts who believe Russia's government is involved have also speculated the dumps may be motivated by a hope they influence Russian elections scheduled for next month. Attributing the real-world identities or nationalities to people behind Internet hacks is almost always a tough undertaking that's prone to error.

- If one or more Russian government groups are behind the attacks and subsequent leaks, Friday's dump represents a troubling escalation, because the Obama administration has already signaled it's considering new sanctions on Russia related to the DNC breach.

- Even if Russia has nothing to do with the attacks, this much seems clear: Guccifer 2.0's objective seems to be to deepen suspicions about the integrity of the US election and throw the Democratic party into disarray.

## Disable WPAD Now or Have Your Accounts Compromised, Researchers Warn

-  Disable WPAD Now or Have Your Accounts Compromised, Researchers Warn  (csoonline.com) 

- It's enabled by default on Windows (and supported by other operating systems) -- but now security researchers are warning that "Man-in-the-middle attackers can abuse the WPAD protocol to hijack people's online accounts and steal their sensitive information even when they access websites over encrypted HTTPS or VPN connections," according to CSO.

- Slashdot reader itwbennett writes: Their advice: disable WPAD now.

- "If you still need to use PAC files, turn off WPAD and configure an explicit URL for your PAC script; and serve it over HTTPS or from a local file"... A few days before their presentation, two other researchers named Itzik Kotler and Amit Klein independently showed the same HTTPS URL leak via malicious PACs in a presentation at the Black Hat security conference.

- A third researcher, Maxim Goncharov, held a separate Black Hat talk about WPAD security risks, entitled BadWPAD.

## Bitfinex Offers $3.6 Million Bounty in Bid to Recover Stolen Bitcoin

- Bitfinex is reportedly offering a reward worth up to $3.6m for the recovery of bitcoins stolen from its exchange last week. The Hong Kong-based startup lost nearly 120,000 BTC in the incident (an amount worth roughly $71m at press time), and now suggests it's willing to offer 5% of these funds (or about 6,000 BTC) as a reward should they be found and returned. The news came social media today in a post by Bitfinex community director Zane Tackett.

## Linux security backfires: Flaw lets hackers inject malware into downloads, disrupt Tor users, etc

- The only piece of information that is needed is the pair of IP addresses (for victim client and server), which is fairly easy to obtain.

- To successfully insert data into a connection you have to know the two IP addresses and the source and destination ports  known as a four-tuple  plus the next valid serial numbers stamped on the exchanged packets.

- This gives the attacker an opportunity to determine the next correct sequence numbers so it can ultimately break or inject itself into the connection. As a workaround while patches to fix the problem are prepared and distributed, you can raise the rate limit on your Linux machine or gadget so that it cannot be reached, by appending the following to /etc/sysctl.conf: net.ipv4.tcp_challenge_ack_limit = 999999999  And then use sysctl -p to activate the new rule.

- At a very high level, the vulnerability allows an attacker to create contention on a shared resource, ie, the global rate limit counter on the target system by sending spoofed packets.

- But with unencrypted traffic, the attacker could insert new content into communications and even add malware, with no additional input from the two legitimate owners of the connection. The boffins, presenting at the 25th Usenix Security Symposium in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, demonstrated the hack on the main website of USA Today, by injecting JavaScript code that siphoned off passwords from a reader login form.

## Mastercard armours its contactless cards against relay attacks

- Elements of the payment card industry have introduced a new contactless payment card security feature, designed to defend against relay attacks. Relay attacks were first demonstrated nine years ago by a team of computer scientists Saar Drimer and Steven Murdoch.  

- The pair also suggested how the security flaw can be mitigated using a technique called distance bounding).

- However, unless this were a widespread fraud, I dont think I would have heard about it even if it had happened, Murdoch explained. There have been bank customers who have come to me or colleagues to say that they have been refused a refund for a Chip and PIN transaction that they said did not take place.

- In some of these cases it might have been a relay attack, but in almost every case it is never established what happened. The banks have taken the position that a relay attack is unlikely and since the decision of whether a bank refunds the customer is based on the most likely explanation, the bank always presents another scenario as being the most likely (normally customer negligence), he added. Murdoch only found out that MasterCard had moved to defend against the relay attack because he regularly looks at the EMVCo specifications and noticed this change. While the new feature is far from a secret, I dont think MasterCard are drawing attention to it, he explained.

- Now that the MasterCard specification is out I am sure the other card schemes have considered what they will do, but I have no indication of a decision. The security researcher has put together an article on Mastercards move and relay attacks more generally for the University College London information security groups Bentham's Gaze blog, which can be found here.

## If you use smart Bluetooth locks, you're asking to be burgled

- DEF CON Bluetooth-enabled locks are increasingly popular, but an analysis of 16 such devices shows 12 are easily hackable with inexpensive kit and some can be broken into from 400 metres away.

- In a presentation to the DEF CON hacking conference in Las Vegas security researcher Anthony Rose detailed how to hack these supposedly smart locks with using the US$100 Ubertooth sniffing device, a $40 Raspberry Pi, a $50 high-gain antenna, and a $15 USB Bluetooth dongle.

- , transmit their passwords in plaintext

- Five more locks are susceptible to replay attacks

- Fuzzing also proved very effective at finding flaws in the source code for many locks, as did crashing them. By sending malformed packets at one lock he managed to crash it, causing the lock to automatically open.

- When Rose contacted the 12 manufacturers about these issues the response was almost universally negative. One Chinese manufacturer shut down its website, but still sells on Amazon. Ten other companies simply ignored his messages. One firm did come back to him, acknowledging the issue, but said it wasnt going to fix it.

## Microsoft open-sources PowerShell and extends it to Linux

- Microsoft is announcing today that its open-sourcing PowerShell, its system administration and configuration management tool thats been a default part of Windows for several years.

- Last year, Microsoft also introduced Visual Studio Code, a free text editor that works on Linux and Mac, as well as on Windows. In the past, Microsofts business focus meant that .NET, and thus PowerShell, were only available on Windows.

- This new thinking empowered the .NET team to port .NET Core to Linux and that in turn, enabled PowerShell to port to Linux as well. Todays move is the newest proof that Microsoft doesnt want its software to be limited to the all-Microsoft stack, and that the company is willing to deal with the dynamics of open-source software development and maintenance.

- But Microsoft is not unique in this regard; Apple has been offering its Swift programming language under an open-source licence since December.

- These efforts have brought Apple and Microsoft a bit more in line with web companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, which have open-sourced new tools on the regular for many years. PowerShell lets users remotely manage multiple other machines, and it can work with public cloud infrastructure resources from Microsoft Azure and other providers.

- Until then, participants of the project need to maintain the utmost secrecy. The team has been instructed to give any results of this audit directly to the lead developer of VeraCrypt using heavily encrypted communications, it said.

- This is to prevent their research from leaking zero-day vulnerabilities to the public, and so that the OSTIF does not have access to the results ahead of the public. Snoop dogged? Sounds like a plan.

- OSTIF suspects snooping rather than misadventure. We have now had a total of four email messages disappear without a trace, stemming from multiple independent senders.

- If nation-states are interested in what we are doing we must be doing something right, OSTIF concludes. Well its tempting to think a spy agency might be involved - after all they have the biggest pool of resources to call on - its not beyond the bounds of possibility that a profit-motivated hacker might be behind the nobbled communications.

## PGP admins: Kill short keys now, or Alice will become Chuck

- 

- The issue of short PGP IDs is back on the agenda, with unknown scammers spoofing identities like Linus Torvalds and Tor core developer Isis Agora Lovecruft. Short keys are just what the name describes: instead of someone passing their whole PGP key to someone else to get a message going, people would memorise the last eight hex characters of their full fingerprint.  

- Hence, as explained back in March by Debian dev Gunner Wolf, Alice might give Bob the short key ID (Wolf's is C1DB 921F), and Bob would search a key repository to find Alice's full fingerprint. The problem: we've known for about five years that short keys are prone to collisions; and in 2012, the Evil32 project published a 32-bit colliding key for the whole PGP Web of Trust. Colliding short keys can be used for an impersonation attack: Chuck's last 32 bits collide with Alice's, so by publishing a fake short key, he can convince Bob to use it for messages instead of the real one. What seems to have happened is that short key impersonation is escalating: as well as Linus, this post to the Linux Kernel Mailing List identifies Greg Kroah-Hartman and other kernel devs as being impersonated in the MIT key server: Search Result of 0x00411886: https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x00411886op=index  Fake Linus Torvalds: 0F6A 1465 32D8 69AE E438 F74B 6211 AA3B [0041 1886]  Real Linus Torvalds: ABAF 11C6 5A29 70B1 30AB E3C4 79BE 3E43 [0041 1886] Search Result of 0x6092693E: https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x6092693Eop=index  Fake Greg Kroah-Hartman: 497C 48CE 16B9 26E9 3F49 6301 2736 5DEA [6092 693E]  Real Greg Kroah-Hartman: 647F 2865 4894 E3BD 4571 99BE 38DB BDC8 [6092 693E]  A responder to Lovecruft's Tweet reckons the fakes uploaded to the MIT keyserver number 20,000:  @isislovecruft @ncardozo you and about 20k others.

- The https://t.co/qJK8g5kP8Z set has been uploaded to the keyservers.  Jeroen van der Ham (@1sand0s) August 16, 2016 Evil32's Eric Swanson has posted at Hackernews that he's generated revocation certificates for all of the fake keys. And for any sysadmin configuring a PGP system: turn short keys off.

- Convenience is never better than security.

## DNC Creates 'Cybersecurity Board' Without Any Cybersecurity Experts

- An anonymous reader writes from a report via Techdirt: The Democratic National Committee has created a "cybersecurity advisory board" to improve its cybersecurity and to "prevent future attacks."

- Politico reports: "'To prevent future attacks and ensure that the DNC's cybersecurity capabilities are best-in-class, I am creating a Cybersecurity Advisory Board composed of distinguished experts in the field,' interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile wrote in a memo.

- 'The Advisory Board will work closely with me and the entire DNC to ensure that the party is prepared for the grave threats it faces -- today and in the future.'

- Members include Rand Beers, former Department of Homeland Security acting secretary; Nicole Wong, former deputy chief technology officer of the U.S. and a former technology lawyer for Google and Twitter; Aneesh Chopra, co-founder of Hunch Analytics and former chief technology officer of the U.S.; and Michael Sussmann, a partner in privacy and data security at the law firm Perkins Coie and a former Justice Department cybercrime prosecutor."

- Even if the goal were just policy, having someone with actual technology experience with cybersecurity would be sensible.

## Researchers crack homomorphic encryption  The Register

- Homomorphic encryption is one idea offered to secure data in the cloud: the idea is to let software work on data without decrypting it. It's mostly a research project at this stage, because it's very processor-intensive and therefore slow, and now one such scheme has the added problem of being vulnerable.  

- A trio of boffins from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne has published their work at the IACR, here. They took a look at a 2014 scheme proposed by MIT's Hongchao Zhou and Gregory Wornell. The EPFL paper, by Sonia Bogos, John Gaspoz and Serge Vaudenay, demonstrates attacks against the scheme's broadcast encryption, a chosen ciphertext attack, and a plaintext attack. Strike one: The scheme proposed encryption for broadcast messages, to support data sharing.

- However, the EPFL paper says an attacker that eavesdrops on broadcast traffic would get enough information to solve the system. A valid scenario for this attack would be one where a service provider has to send an activation key to its customers.

- The activation key is the same for all the customers.

- In such case, when the service provider has to send the encrypted activation key to enough customers, an unauthorised user could recover the activation key, the authors write. Strike two: In the chosen ciphertext attack, they write, an attacker with access to an oracle that decrypts the text can run a brute-force to recover the encryption key. Strike three: As with the chosen ciphertext attack, the plaintext attack is a successful brute force against the encryption. All of which means the EPFL boffins have sent the MIT homomorphic encryption scheme back for some warranty fixes.

## Powerful Bit-Flipping Attack

- New research: "Flip Feng Shui: Hammering a Needle in the Software Stack," by Kaveh Razavi, Ben Gras, Erik Bosman Bart Preneel, Cristiano Giuffrida, and Herbert Bos.

- Abstract: We introduce Flip Feng Shui (FFS), a new exploitation vector which allows an attacker to induce bit flips over arbitrary physical memory in a fully controlled way.

- We show FFS is possible today with very few constraints on the target data, by implementing an instance using the Rowhammer bug and memory deduplication (an OS feature widely deployed in production).

- Rowhammer, in turn, allows an attacker to flip bits in controlled (initially unknown) locations in the target page.

- Using FFS, we exemplify end-to-end attacks breaking OpenSSH public-key authentication, and forging GPG signatures from trusted keys, thereby compromising the Ubuntu/Debian update mechanism.

## Tech support scammers mess with hacker's mother, so he retaliated with ransomware

- Vengeful security boffin Ivan Kwiatkowski has infected the computer of an Indian tech support scammer with the Locky ransomware. Kwiatkowski inflicted the virus on the scammers after they attempted to fleece his parents.  

- The retaliatory strike was easy for the French malware analyst; during a phone call with the scammers he sent through what he claimed was an image of his credit card which, when opened by the scammer, unleashed the Locky ransomware. While his ability to watch the bloodbath ended with the scammer hanging up, it is likely that Locky, rated the world's most prolific email-borne threat, ripped through the scammer's machine encrypting large swathes of files and possibly travelling through the network to encrypt other machines and connected local and cloud drives. Kwiatkowski (@JusticeRage) set sights on the scammers after his concerned parents phoned bearing reports that their computer was apparently infected with Zeus, according to a fake virus infection advertisement. The researcher spun up a virtual machine and dropped the net scum a call.

- They logged into his machine in a remote desktop session and typed in random crap in a command prompt pretending it was a sign of infection.    Kwiatkowski offered to buy the scammers' security software with some fake random credit card numbers, then sent a would-be photo of his credit card for payment. "And while a background process quietly encrypts his files, we try paying a couple more times with those random CC numbers and he finally gives up, suggesting that I contact my bank and promising to call me back next Monday," Kwiatkowski says. "So if you're a French speaker, you should definitely take 15 minutes of your time, call them at +339 75 18 77 63 and try to social engineer them into doing something funny.

- " This reporter has heard many tales of researchers hacking back against web scum unfortunate enough to target capable hackers.

- Some claimed to have infected web scammer machines with remote access trojans, taking photos of operators with web cams, and formatting hard disks.

## Shadow Brokers NSA Hack Leaks 0-day Vulnerabilities

-  Right now theres a ton of people talking about the NSA Hack, the severity, the repercussions and the value of what has been leaked.

- It seems the 0-day exploits in the cache of stolen arent super recent ones, as it appears they are from 2013.  But even so, some of them havent been patched as both Cisco and Fortinet have warned customers about the vulnerabilities revealed in the data posted by Shadow Brokers. A group calling itself the Shadow Brokers has started an online auction for top-of-the-range tools it claims were stolen from the Equation Group, a digital attack squad linked to the NSA. The Shadow Brokers posted up news of the auction saying (in broken English) that they had been monitoring the Equation Groups servers, had stolen the advanced hacking tools, and will auction them off to the highest bidder.

- The group said that if it gets Bitcoins worth $1m they will release the tools for free to everyone. We want make sure Wealthy Elite recognizes the danger cyber weapons, this message, our auction, poses to their wealth and control.

-  Now it seems NSA wasnt hacked directly, but via an agency called Equation Group which is believed to be a digital cyber-terrorism arm of the NSA. Even so, it brings up some well debated issues about the NSA reporting zero-day flaws to vendors rather than hoarding them (which the White House promised they would stop doing). A preliminary analysis shows the revealed list seems to be focusing on router flaws, some of them quite old.

- But Timo Steffens, a member of the German CERT-Bund team, is taking a skeptical line, although he acknowledged that if this is a fake, the scammers had put in a lot of effort. Initial analysis by the likes of Kaspersky Labs, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, and a host of independent security researchers shore up claims by a hacking group calling itself Shadow Brokers that the exploits and toolsets it hopes to auction for millions of dollars in Bitcoins are legitimate Equation group weaponry. Kaspersky Labs last year revealed the Equation group to be almost certainly a state-sponsored actor and, according to deep analysis of its activities, highly likely to be a wing of the National Security Agency given a series of very striking operational and technical similarities. The Shadow Brokers group seems to likely originate from Russia, so this is a nation state vs nation state attack possibly at the highest levels of each countries intelligence agencies. Its an interesting story and its creating a lot of news and drama, its a tough call for NSA as they have to maintain their attack capabilities against Russia and China whilst also balancing the health of American commerce and the safety of all the users utilising equipment from those vendors.

## EquationGroup, ShadowBrokers, and Loving The Cyber Pathogen Bomb

- These scripts and exploits are just the tip of the 2013 iceberg and the reality is that knowing what the likes of  J-39 and their ilk were hoping for back in the day we are well and truly fucked if they decide to go all out cyberdouche.

- And if you attempt to treat intelligence cyber attribute this shit you are only trying to get clicks for ads. But seriously, the biggest issue I have with all of this is that while we are all slobbering over the dump and the potential one to come no one seems to be talking about how fucked up this is.

- While these guys are making and buying 0days and pwning foreign nations our own infrastructure lays like a burned out whore in the missionary position.

- See, the rub of it all is that corporations are the ones that hold the infrastructure and fuck all trying to make them become secure through legislation or any kinds of rules.

- So here we are with all our shit in the wind to start with, no mass movements to secure the nations everything, and now a dump of just some of our cyber weapons has been spilled online as a big fat fuck you. Yeah, I feel good about where we are. Still, the shit is three years old.. Whos to say that those sploits still work on systems in China lets say.

## Cisco cutting 5,500 jobs, 7% of workforce, in shift away from switches and routers

- (Reuters)  Cisco Systems Inc said it would lay off up to 5,500 employees, or nearly 7 percent of its workforce, as the worlds largest networking gear maker shifts focus to areas such as security, Internet of Things and cloud. Ciscos traditional business of switches and routers has been struggling with sluggish demand from telecom carriers and enterprise customers and intense competition from companies such as Huawei and Juniper Networks Inc. Revenue in the companys traditional routers business fell 6 percent in the fourth-quarter ended July 30, while switching unit revenue was up 2 percent. Chief Executive Chuck Robbins, who took over from John Chambers in July last year, has been steering the company toward more software and services businesses. Revenue in Ciscos security business, which offers firewall protection as well as intrusion detection and prevention systems, rose 16 percent. Cisco, which is also betting on acquisitions to bolster its faster-growing businesses, has made 10 acquisitions since Robbins took the helm, according to FactSet StreetAccount data. These deals range from internet-of-things startup Jasper Technologies to cloud security provider CloudLock. Ciscos net profit rose to $2.81 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $2.32 billion, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 63 cents per share. Revenue fell 1.6 percent to $12.64 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 60 cents and revenue of $12.58 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cisco, which expects to start laying off employees from the first quarter, said it will take a charge of about $325 million to $400 million in the quarter.

- On the whole, the company expects a pre-tax charge of $700 million. Technology news site CRN, citing sources close to the company, reported on Tuesday that Cisco planned to lay off about 14,000 employees, or nearly 20 percent of its workforce. Ciscos shares were down 1.2 percent at $30.38 in after-market trading on Wednesday. The shares had gained 13.2 percent this year through Wednesdays close, compared with the 6.8 percent increase in the broader SP 500 index.

## USENIX Security Best Paper 2016  The Million Key Question ... Origins of RSA Public Keys | Light Blue Touchpaper

-  Petr Svenda et al from Masaryk University in Brno won the Best Paper Award at this years USENIX Security Symposium with their paper classifying public RSA keys according to their source. I really like the simplicity of the original assumption.

- They thought these differences should be sufficient to detect a particular cryptographic implementation and all that was needed were public keys.

- The best paper award is a well-deserved recognition as Ive worked with and followed Petrs activities closely. The authors created a method for efficient identification of the source (software library or hardware device) of RSA public keys.

- This classification can be used as a fingerprint that decreases the anonymity of users of Tor and other privacy enhancing mailers or operators. The graphs extracted from: The Million Key Question  Investigating The Origins of RSA Public Keys (follow the link for more). All that is a result of an analysis of over 60 million freshly generated keys from 22 open- and closed-source libraries and from 16 different smart-cards.

- There are interesting opportunities for enterprise compliance audits, as the classification only requires access to datasets of public keys  often created as a by-product of internal network vulnerability scanning. An extended version of the paper is available from http://crcs.cz/rsa.

## RNG Whitening Bug Weakened All Versions of GPG | Qntra

-  Werner Koch, maintainer of Libgcrypt and GnuPG, announced today: "Felix Dorre and Vladimir Klebanov from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology found a bug in the mixing functions of Libgcrypt's random number generator: An attacker who obtains 4640 bits from the RNG can trivially predict the next 160 bits of output.

- A first analysis on the impact of this bug in GnuPG shows that existing RSA keys are not weakened.

- ) It should be remembered that, due to the structure of the OpenPGP format, breaking a GPG subkey is often quite nearly as good as breaking the primary key  i.e. it will allow the attacker to create valid signatures, in the case of a signature-only subkey, or else to read intercepted ciphertext, or both. And thus we find that, due to the staggeringly-braindamaged design of the protocol and of this implementation, GPG users who elected to use longer-than-default GPG keys (Phuctor presently contains 1,090,450 RSA moduli which exceed 2048 bits in length1) ended up with smaller-than-default effective cryptographic strength. Likewise noteworthy is the fact that this bug was contained in an RNG 'whitening' routine.

- The popular but wholly-pseudoscientific practice of RNG 'whitening' creates the appearance of an effective source of entropy at times when  potentially  none exists2, at the cost of introducing a mathematical relationship (sometimes, as in the case at hand, a very exploitable one) between RNG output bits, which by their nature are intended to be wholly uncorrelated. Not all of these moduli were generated using GPG.

- A whitened (walked over with, e.g., RIPEMD  as in GPG, or SHA2, or AES) stream of zeroes, will typically pass mathematical tests of entropy (e.g., the Diehard suite) with flying colors.

## SWEET32: Birthday attacks on 64-bit block ciphers in TLS and OpenVPN

- When the amount of data encrypted under a fixed key approaches this limit, the security guarantees of the mode of operation start to crumble.

-  Many of the most influential Internet security protocols, such as TLS, SSH, and IPsec were standardized at a time when 64-bit block ciphers, such as Triple-DES and Blowfish, were still considered strong.

- The attacker runs malicious JavaScript code on the victim's browser that repeatedly sends HTTP queries to the target website server, each containing the session cookie.

-  The attacker code consists of two parts: a JavaScript program that sends a large number of HTTP requests, and a network adversary who processes the resulting ciphertext to recovers a 16-byte secret.

- Concretely, we recommend the following measures to prevent our attack:   Web servers and VPNs should be configured to prefer 128-bit ciphers.

## Tor General Strike

- The newly-elected Board Members must reveal their connection to the Appelbaum investigation and their internal discussion on the matter.

- That the Tor Project chose to give The New York Times an exclusive story on Appelbaum is highly unusual and an embarrassment.

- The Tor Project must publish a report on current staff and active volunteers, detailing their backgrounds and revealing any military or government work.

- This includes anyone who introduced intelligence workers or people with security clearance in the Five Eyes countries, current or former.

- We know from IRC logs that Tor Project staff knew of a CIA hire on at least one occasion and kept it secret.

## I am very saddened to announce that I am quitting Tor

- While I am very disappointed that so few "friends" of Jake reached out to him before picking a side or deciding to let this happen without reacting, I want you to know that my hardest criticism is not addressed to you.

- If Tor believed there was victims, why did no one ask if I had bad experiences with Jake? This would have been easy given that Alison spent an hour alone with me in a cafe at the last TorDev meeting and had several communication channels with me.

- Before this happened, the discourse was: the hacker/freedom community is dominated by straight, male-identified people among which we can find a certain number of predators, or at least of men who don't always behave respectfully around women.

- I am actually really upset that I had to hear through third parties that Shari considered me an agent of Jake in the context of other events, before the website even went live - why didn't she address it directly with me?

- More generally for almost two months I wondered how it could even be possible that no one is even questioning the veracity of the statements, given that I know that some people at Tor have information that contradicts the stories told by some of the "victims".

## AMD Says Upcoming Zen CPU Will Outperform Intel Broadwell-E

- Reader MojoKid writes: AMD has been talking about the claimed 40% IPC (Instructions Per Clock) improvement of its forthcoming Zen processor versus the company's existing Excavator core for ages.

- Zen's initial availability is slated for late this year, with lager-scale roll-out planned for early 2017.

- However, last night, at a private press event in San Francisco, AMD unveiled a lot more details on their Zen processor architecture.

- AMD claims to have achieved that 40 percent IPC uplift with a newly-designed, higher-performance branch prediction and a micro-op cache for more efficient issuing of operations.

- Blender may have been chosen for a reason but this early benchmark demo looks impressive for AMD and its forthcoming Zen architecture.

## Certificate Authority Gave Out Certs for GitHub to a GitHub Account Holder

- message on Mozilla's security policy mailing list notes that a free certificate authority named WoSign appeared to be doing some pretty bad stuff, including handing out certificates for a base domain if someone merely had control over a subdomain. This was discovered by accident, but then tested on GitHub... and it worked.

## FreeSense: Indoor Human Identification with WiFi Signals

-   References  CitationsNASA ADS 

- While these methods could be very useful under different conditions, they also suffer from certain shortcomings (e.g., user privacy, sensing coverage range).

- The influence can be captured by the Channel State Information (CSI) time series of WIFI.

- Specifically, a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) techniques is used for CSI waveform-based human identification.

- We implemented the system in a 6m*5m smart home environment and recruited 9 users for data collection and evaluation.

## Hillary Clinton Used BleachBit To Wipe Emails

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from Neowin: The open-source disk cleaning application, BleachBit, got quite a decent ad pitch from the world of politics after it was revealed lawyers of the presidential hopeful, Hillary Clinton, used the software to wipe her email servers.

- "[South Carolina Representative, Trey Gowdy, spoke to Fox News about Hillary Clinton's lawyers using BleachBit to wipe the private servers.

- Two of the main features that are listed on the BleachBit website include "Shred files to hide their contents and prevent data recovery," and "Overwrite free disk space to hide previously deleted files."

- Slashdot reader ahziem adds: The IT team for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton used the open source cleaning software BleachBit to wipe systems "so even God couldn't read them," according to South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy on Fox News.

- His comments on the "drastic cyber-measure" were in response to the question of whether emails on her private Microsoft Exchange Server were simply about "yoga and wedding plans."

##  T543 TCP ISNs and Temperature induced clock skews

- Attack summary:

QoS acts as a countermeasure by preventing flows on an anonymity-network node from interfering with each other. However, an inevitable result is that when a flow is running at less than its reserved capacity, CPU load on the node will be reduced. This induces a temperature decrease, which affects the frequency of the crystal oscillator driving the system clock. This effect can be measured remotely by requesting timestamps and deriving clock skew. This vector is not low hanging fruit [2] but it would be good to shut down for those who need higher assurance

## FBI says foreign hackers penetrated state election systems

- The FBI has uncovered evidence that foreign hackers penetrated two state election databases in recent weeks, prompting the bureau to warn election officials across the country to take new steps to enhance the security of their computer systems, according to federal and state law enforcement officials.The FBI warning, contained in a flash alert from the FBIs Cyber Division, a copy of which was obtained by Yahoo News, comes amid heightened concerns among U.S. intelligence officials about the possibility of cyberintrusions, potentially by Russian state-sponsored hackers, aimed at disrupting the November elections.Those concerns prompted Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to convene a conference call with state election officials on Aug. 15, in which he offered his departments help to make state voting systems more secure, including providing federal cybersecurity experts to scan for vulnerabilities, according to a readout of the call released by the department.Johnson emphasized in the call that Homeland Security was not aware of specific or credible cybersecurity threats to the election, officials said.

- Attempts should not be made to touch or ping the IP addresses directly.This is a big deal, said Rich Barger, chief intelligence officer for ThreatConnect, a cybersecurity firm, who reviewed the FBI alert at the request of Yahoo News.

- He also said the method of attack on one of the state election systems  including the types of tools used by the hackers to scan for vulnerabilities and exploit them  appears to resemble methods used in other suspected Russian state-sponsored cyberattacks, including one just this month on the World Anti-Doping Agency.The FBI did not respond to detailed questions about the alert, saying in a statement only that such bulletins are provided to help systems administrators guard against the actions of persistent cyber criminals. Menzel, the Illinois election official, said that in a recent briefing, FBI agents confirmed to him that the perpetrators were believed to be foreign hackers, although they were not identified by country.

- The results are tabulated by computers.These are reasonably safe because the voting machines are backed up by paper ballots that can be checked, says Andrew W. Appel, a Princeton University computer science professor who has studied election security.

- Still, according to Barger, the cybersecurity expert, such attacks can be used to create havoc and sow doubt over the election results.As a result, the FBI alert urges state officials to take additional steps to secure their systems, including conducting vulnerability scans of their databases.

- Blockstack can combine the benefits of direct verification and the Web of Trust with the ease of use of popular apps like email by linking signing keys to easily-memorable usernames.

- A Blockstack username, also called a blockchain ID, is owned by a bitcoin address

- Records associated with the blockchain ID are stored in a file called a zone file and cryptographically linked to every Blockstack transaction using the OP_RETURN field

- These records can contain any information the user wants to provably link to their blockchain ID.

## Apple releases iOS 9.3.5 to fix 3 zero-day vulnerabilities [Updated]

-  Just a few weeks after posting iOS 9.3.4 to fix a jailbreaking-related bug, Apple has released iOS 9.3.5 to all supported iPhones and iPads.

- The update provides an "important security update" and comes just a few weeks before the expected release of iOS 10, which is currently pretty far along in the developer/public beta process. Update: Apple also tells us that these bugs were fixed in the latest versions of the iOS 10 public and developer betas, which were released last week. Apple's security release notes say that three bugs have been fixed, two in the iOS kernel and one in WebKit.

- The bugs were discovered by Citizen Lab and Lookout, which said they were actively exploited to hijack the iPhone of a political dissident.

- Lookout collectively calls the three zero-day vulnerabilities "Trident," and says that they could allow an victim's personal data to be accessed after opening a link sent in a text message.

- Trident infects a user's phone "invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know theyve been compromised."

## Anonymouth  Document Anonymization Tool

- Anonymouth is a Java-based application that aims to give users to tools and knowledge needed to begin anonymizing documents they have written.

- Anonymouth requires a corpus (basically a database of other authors and documents they have written) to run.

- Inititalized within GUIMain as should nearly all Anonymouth class instances, this holds the main method and thread that handles processing and reprocessing documents.

- This should be the top priority as of now, see Andrew for the plan and details. [1] An internal  thesaurus must be implemented to help users change words to remove (that or nicely implement the one built into the system, preferable if possible) [2] An intelligent method to search and filter through words to add (start with simple search box, then possibly extend to automatic filtering based on synonyms?

-  [1] During processing on OS X (though the problem may extend to other operating systems as well) the Stanford POS tagger is extremely prone to breaking due to a fatal threading issue which results in heap space or out of memory exceptions.

## Evidence points to another Snowden at the NSA

- Where the Watergate burglars came away empty-handed and in handcuffs, the modern- day cyber thieves walked away with tens of thousands of sensitive political documents and are still unidentified.Now, in the latest twist, hacking tools themselves, likely stolen from the National Security Agency, are on the digital auction block.

- This is probably some Russian mind game, down to the bogus accent, James A. Lewis, a computer expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, told the New York Times.

- Known as the Advanced Network Technology (ANT) catalog, it consisted of 50 pages of extensive pictures, diagrams and descriptions of tools for every kind of hack, mostly targeted at devices manufactured by U.S. companies, including Apple, Cisco, Dell and many others.

- Another, codenamed IRATEMONK, is, Technology that can infiltrate the firmware of hard drives manufactured by Maxtor, Samsung, Seagate and Western Digital. In 2014, I spent three days in Moscow with Snowden for a magazine assignment and a PBS documentary.

- He also co-wrote an article about the catalog in Der Spiegel. But again, he never named a source, which led many to assume, mistakenly, that it was Snowden.In addition to WikiLeaks, for years Appelbaum worked for Tor, an organization focused on providing its customers anonymity on the Internet.

## Snowden files confirm Shadow Brokers spilled NSA's Equation Group spy tools over the web

- That top-secret document only came to light today, via The Intercept, five days after the Shadow Brokers uploaded their cyber-haul. Matthew Green, assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute, said the appearance of the string in both the manual and the leaked code is unlikely to be a coincidence. According to a internal NSA presentation, SECONDDATE redirects a web user trying to visit a legitimate website  the agency uses CNN.com as an example  to an NSA-managed server dubbed FOXACID, which scans the target computer and infects it with surveillance and remote-control malware. The existence of FOXACID has been known since 2013.

- The new documents  thought to be drafted in 2010  say it runs, or ran, on Windows Server 2003, and is accessible from the public internet. SECONDDATE is a component of another piece of attack software dubbed BADDECISION, which is used to infiltrate Wi-Fi networks.

- To set up man-in-the-middle attacks, the NSA uses piece of hardware called BLINDDATE, which intercepts wireless traffic. A 2013 presentation gives two examples of how the system works.

- Using SECONDDATE and QUANTUM, the NSA's Tailored Access Operations hacking team infected an internal staff network in Pakistans National Telecommunications Corporation, and quietly installed surveillance code on four ZXJ10 switches.

- The attack, dubbed REXKWONDO, was the first time the agency had been able to get into the Lebanon's international gateway routers. It's going to be an ugly summer The identity of the Shadow Brokers is a mystery: it could be Russian intelligence, an inside job, or private lunatics preparing to tango with Uncle Sam. The confirmation of the veracity of the Shadow Broker archive is bad news for the NSA, but is potentially catastrophic for the rest of us. Given the size of the archive, and the range of computer security vulnerability exploits it contains, malware authors and hackers are going to be rushing to use the information to crack systems around the world.

## Microsoft Has Broken Millions of Webcams with Windows 10 Anniversary Update

- If your webcam has stopped functioning since the release of the Anniversary update, you are not alone but the good news is a fix is coming, hopefully in September. Microsoft made a significant change with the release of Windows 10 and support for webcams that is causing serious problems for not only consumers but also the enterprise.

- The short answer is that with the Anniversary update there are new scenarios for applications to be able to access the webcam and the MJPEG or H264 encoding processes could have resulted in duplication of encoding the stream (poor performance) so the company limited the input methods to stop this from happening. Because of this change, which Microsoft tried to defend but then realized the scale of the impact this change has caused, means that when a webcam tries to use MJPEG or H264, the device will freeze.

- When Paul started having these issues a few months ago, we figured it was either a bad driver from Logitech or possibly even the Skylake CPU. On my desktop, where my webcam is connected, I do not run Insider builds other than in a VM.

- On August 2nd, when I updated, my webcam began freezing immediately when trying to use Skype to record What The Tech. In the support thread, customers are stating how Skype is freezing but more concerning are comments such as this: We have a working product running for years and millions of unhappy users that are unable to use it at all after this update and another user states We have millions of users and we are in situation now where we have to tell them not to update the Windows anymore or switch to Mac OS. These are clearly enterprise customers who have customer machines running the Anniversary update that has broken their product who are now scrambling to resolve these issues. Mike M, an engineer on the Windows Camera team has been commenting in the support thread where the complaints are stacking up and says that a fix is in the pipeline for hopefully a September release.

- Thats the good news, the bad news is that there is not a temporary fix to hold everyone over until the patch is released and since you now only have 10 days to rollback your update, for most users, they are stuck on the Anniversary build. [Update] Rafael has figured out a workaround that should hopefully stop the freezing issue; if you are comfortable tweaking the registry, make this change.

## BleachBit stifles investigation of Hillary Clinton

- The IT team for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton used the open source cleaning software BleachBit to wipe systems "so even God couldnt read them," according to South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy on Fox News.

- " BleachBit is mentioned at about three minutes into this video that aired live on the Fox News television station. Rep.

- Ironically, Schneier was writing to a non-governmental audience. Last year when Clinton was asked about wiping her email server, she joked, "Like with a cloth or something?"

- It turns out now that BleachBit was that cloth, according to remarks by Sen. Gowdy. @ThreatcoreNews compared the situation to the 18 minutes of audio erased from tapes from President Richard Nixon's Oval Office. Jonathan Zdziarski quoted on CNN.com argued, "Someone trying to cover their tracks would likely pay for and use a much more expensive, specialized data destruction tool," but commercial tools leave a money trail. As of the time of writing BleachBit has not been served a warrant or subpoena in relation to the investigation.

- The cleaning process is not reversible. Immediately when the story broke the morning of August 25, traffic to the BleachBit web site and download servers spiked.

## Google Fiber reduces staff by 50%

- Alphabet, Googles parent company, plans to reduce the staff for Google Fiber in half  from 1,000 to about 500  amid rising costs and slower-than-expected subscriber growth, according to The Information (subscription required).   Google Fiber has not released subscriber figures, but the report said the division has about 200,000, putting it well below the pace required to reach a projected target of 5 million within five years.

- Google Fiber launched broadband and TV service in its first market, Kansas City, in July 2012.

-    Google Fiber ended 2015 with just north of 53,000 video subs, per MoffettNathansons analysis of data from the U.S.

-    The report from The Information does come about as Google Fiber explores the use of wireless-based high-speed Internet technologies, which could reduce expenses while speeding the acceleration of deployment.

- Googles interest in wireless was seemingly amplified when it acquired Webpass, a company that specializes in wireless broadband delivery in markets such as San Francisco, Oakland, San Diego, Miami, Chicago and Boston.   Though Google Fiber has reportedly put some expansion plans on hold in Portland and San Jose as it weighs wireless alternatives, it did launch service sign-ups in portions of Salt Lake City this week.   Google Fiber has also launched service in parts of Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; Kansas City; and Provo, Utah, with commitments to deploy in San Antonio; and Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham, N.C. Its been mulling expansions in Los Angeles; Chicago; Dallas; Portland, Ore.; San Jose, Irvine and San Diego, Calif.; Phoenix; Oklahoma City; Louisville, Ky.; and Jacksonville and Tampa, Fla. Google Fiber also has plans to offer service on a network being built by Huntsville Utilities.   Other Bets, the unit of Alphabet that includes Google Fiber and other longer-term moonshot  projects, generated Q2 revenues of $185 million, up from $74 million a year ago, while operating losses widened to $709 million, from $555 million.

## Hackers attack site of Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones, post racist abuse

-  Share this story

-  Leslie Jones, the black comedian who starred in the recent all-female remake of Ghostbusters, has been forced to take her website down after hackers seemingly took control, posted racist abuse, personal information, and what were apparently nude pictures stolen from the actor's iCloud account Jones, 48, has been the target of sustained online attacks for months, much of it racist and sexist in nature. On Wednesday, hackers escalated the situation by posting a picture of the dead gorilla Harambe onto her personal Tumblr site, as well as explicit photos, her phone number and Twitter password, and screen grabs of her driver's licence and passport, according to TMZ. Jones had become a particular target for the online alt-right movement, many of whom were angry that the Ghostbusters franchise had been relaunched with women taking the lead roles.

- Sustained abuse forced her off Twitter in July, but since then she has returned to tweet about the Rio Olympics in her capacity as a correspondent for the US NBC television network. Jones has not made any comment following the hack of her website. Twitter, meanwhile, recently announced new quality filters to help clamp down on the hoards of anonymous trolls which have plagued it in recent years. Update The US department of homeland security is currently probing the incident against Jones' website. "The investigation is currently ongoing.

- In order to protect the integrity of the case, no further details are available at this time," officials at the US immigration and customs enforcement agency said.

## Chronicled Introduces New Ethereum-Powered IoT Open Registry

- Chronicled, a blockchain startup headquartered in San Francisco, has introduced an Ethereum blockchain-based physical asset verification platform that enables companies and manufacturers to register and verify physical items in an irrefutable and decentralized network.Chip companies, physical IP creators and manufacturers can authenticate embedded Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Near Field Communication (NFC) chips on the Chronicled-Ethereum platform, which serves as an interoperable backend for app developers and consumers.The startups launch of its interoperable and tamper-proof verification platform sets a positive precedent for other developers in the Internet of Things (IoT) market, as the Chronicled team believes the launch of its platform is a significant milestone for the IoT ecosystem.The IoT concept has been around for a long time, Chronicled CEO, Ryan Orr, explained to Bitcoin Magazine, but the architecture of the first information-web of the early-2000s was insufficient to support secure registrations of private property and the actions that consumers wanted to do with private property  like buying, insuring, financing, reselling, etc.

- Thus the IoT concept has not flourished and instead, each company has all of its IoT-connected products registered to its own private back-end database or cloud service and interactions are limited mostly to content provision.The Chronicled platform also serves as a solution to an intriguing problem dealt by developers and users in the telecommunications industry.

- That is, telecommunications firms prefer to host their own cellular phone networks and private databases instead of leveraging an interoperable network for other companies and organizations in the industry to access.Such barriers between telecommunications service providers and others in the industry, including developers, users and manufacturers restrict the development and emergence of innovative applications, platforms and products.This siloed architecture of the IoT today is much how the Internet was back in the earliest days, prior to the invention of the open internet protocol, said Orr.

- This interoperable back end is a valuable building block and positive step for the entire IoT ecosystem including app developers, brands and consumers alike.Over a short period of time, Chronicled has already deployed nearly 10,000 NFC and BLE chips in its decentralized blockchain network.

- The successful deployment of physical items in a blockchain network suggest that the the billion-dollar industry of IoT is close to being unravelled by startups.Recognizing this potential of the Chronicled platform, its Chief Technology Officer, Maurizio Greco, stated that the company is providing open-source tools to help developers in building products and applications with smart phone scan and authentication functionalities.

## North Korea Unveils Netflix-Like Streaming Service Called 'Manbang'

- North Korea has unveiled a set-top box that offers video-on demand services similar to Netflix.

- The service is called Manbang, which translates to "everywhere" in Korean, and allows consumers to stream documentaries about Kim Jong Un and other "educational" programs, as well as five live TV channels.

- "If a viewer wants to watch, for instance, an animal movie and sends a request to the equipment, it will show the relevant video to the viewer [...] this is two-way communications," according to NK News.

- It reportedly works by plugging the set-top box into an internet modem, then connecting an HDMI cable from the cable box to the TV.

- A very small number of North Koreans will actually be able to use the device as "only a few thousand [...] have access to the state-sanctioned internet, in a nation of 25 million people," reports New York Daily News.

## Python JITs are coming

- "Transitions are sneaky like that", Smith said, and you see the same curve in unrelated areas, like epidemiology, where virus propagation has a similar trend.

- The percentage of web browser users with JavaScript JITs over time exhibits a similar curve as well.

- He is organizing a Python compilers workshop in conjunction with SciPy, which will be held in Austin, Texas in mid-July.

- But if it is passed a NumPy array, which is "opaque C stuff", the JIT doesn't understand it, so it will have trouble even achieving the performance of a non-NumPy version on a JIT-less CPython.

- Another consequence of the shift to JIT-based Python will be that the development and maintenance of JIT implementations will require focused and sustained effort that only companies can provideat least currently.

## Ways Your Wi-Fi Router Can Spy on You

- With that data, the router can make small adjustments to communicate more reliably with the devices its connected to.But it can also be used to monitor humansand in surprisingly detailed ways.As people move through a space with a Wi-Fi signal, their bodies affect it, absorbing some waves and reflecting others in various directions.

- They could tell how many people were in a room from behind a solid wooden door, a 6-inch hollow wall supported by steel beams, or an 8-inch concrete walland detect messages drawn in the air from a distance of five meters (but still in another room) with 100 percent accuracy.(Using more precise sensors, the same MIT researchers went on to develop systems that can distinguish between different people standing behind walls, and remotely  monitor breathing and heart rates with 99 percent accuracy.

- President Obama got a glimpse of the latter technology during last years White House Demo Day in the form of Emerald, a device geared towards elderly people that can detect physical activity and falls throughout an entire home.

- Instead of using cameras to monitor a spacerecording and preserving everything that happens in detaila router-based system could detect movements or actions without intruding too much, they said.I asked the lead researcher behind WiKey, Kamran Ali, whether his technology could be used to secretly steal sensitive data.

- Routers could soon keep kids and older adults safe, log daily activities, or make a smart home run more smoothlybut, if invaded by a malicious hacker, they could also be turned into incredibly sophisticated hubs for monitoring and surveillance.

## Kim Dotcom Will Revive Megaupload, Linking File Transfers To Bitcoin Microtransactions

-  Kim Dotcom Will Revive Megaupload, Linking File Transfers To Bitcoin Microtransactions  (fortune.com) 

- Long-time Slashdot reader SonicSpike quotes an article from Fortune: The controversial entrepreneur Kim Dotcom said last month that he was preparing to relaunch Megaupload, the file-sharing site that U.S. and New Zealand authorities dramatically shut down in 2012, with bitcoins being involved in some way...

- This system will be called Bitcache, and Dotcom claimed its launch would send the bitcoin price soaring way above its current $575 value. The launch of Megaupload 2.0 will take place on January 20, 2017, he said, urging people to "buy bitcoin while cheap, like right now, trust me..." Crucially, Dotcom said the Bitcache system would overcome bitcoin's scaling problems.

- "It eliminates all blockchain limitations," he claimed.  Every file transfer taking place over Megaupload "will be linked to a tiny Bitcoin micro transaction," Dotcom posted on Twitter.

- Meanwhile, the FBI apparently let the registration lapse on the Megaupload domain, which they seized in 2012, and Ars Technica reports that the site is now full of porn ads.

## NeoDNS: A new DNS like the one we know

- Adopting NeoDNS should not break backwards compatibility. Authentication of domains: users must be able to verify that they are talking to the legitimate service, without a globally trusted central authorit(y|ies).

- We relax this requirement and simple demand that an attempt at impersonation should become publicly known. Performant: minimal overhead when compared with the existing systems. 

- There is no direct protection against this, but it becomes instantly known to the world since this needs to be published in the ledger and committed to the blockchain, before being considered valid by Trent and served to Bob.

- NeoDNS forces transparency for the DNS/PKI provider, but does not stop a malicious actor from coercing Talos  however the compromise becomes public knowledge.

- This would get detected by the Trusted Entities (even if they start tracking at a later time), since the hashes in the block chain would not match the TLD ledger.

## A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering: Attack of the week: 64-bit ciphers in TLS

- What they show is that ciphersuites that use 64-bit blocklength ciphers -- notably 3DES -- are vulnerable to plaintext recovery attacks that work even if the attacker cannot recover the encryption key.

- The IV is sent (in the clear) along with the ciphertext.

- Most of the time, the resulting first ciphertext block will be unique

- However, if the encryptor processes enough messages, sooner or later the attacker will see a collision

- Since the IVs are random and known to the attacker, the attacker has (with high probability) learned the XOR of two (unknown) plaintexts!

- in the case of 3DES, somewhere in the vicinity of 4 billion enciphered blocks.

## The Docker security philosophy is secure by default

- Docker Engine supports all of the isolation features available in the Linux kernel

- Gartner asserts that applications deployed in containers are more secure than applications deployed on the bare OS

- Containers offer many overall advantages. From a security perspective, they create a method to reduce attack surfaces and isolate applications to only the required components, interfaces, libraries and network connections.

- The chart below depicts the outcome of the security evaluation of three container platforms

## The Sad State of Docker

- Lets dive deep into what I found wrong. First, I do not think a company should market and promote exciting new features that have not been tested well.

- Swarm in v1.12 is very easy to setup versus the predecessor and I wanted to put it in production at home (homeduction).

- When it did work sometimes, the mesh networking would not route traffic properly to the host running my container.

-  It is not wise to explode the Internet and conventions with marketing material about exciting new features that do not work as presented.

- Yes, we all know Docker is awesome and is trying to play catch up with competitors such as Apcera and Kubernetes, but please take it slow and make Docker great again! [Edit 8/31/2016] Tweaked paragraphs to make it more clear that my testing was not done on the Raspberry Pi and done with docker-machine on a laptop.

## Ad-Blocking Browser Brave Launches Bitcoin Micropayments

- Users then set a monthly amount they want to spend, and the browser automatically calculates how to disperse the money to the selected websites based on page impressions. Using a toggle feature familiar to Apple owners, the interface then lets users select if they don't want to pay some of their most-visited sites.

- But wed like to be able to let users pay the tenant, not the landlord in the future," Eich said. Reception uncertain When Brave first launched earlier this year, its ad-blocking service received widespread criticism from the publishing industry for what a trade group called "blatantly illegal" technology it said would stunt its members' ability to generate revenue on their content. But at the time, only part of Brave's functionality had been enabled, and it remains unclear whether the publishing industry will continue this course of action against the startup. Now that the feature is live, Brave is continuing to position the browser as a tool to help news sites and other content creators recoup revenue currently being lost by those already using ad-blocking technology.  In an August interview with CoinDesk about Braves $4.5m investment, Eich said that since the initial push-back from publishers hes engaged with many of them who have begun to view the technology in less aggressive terms. Eich estimates that someone using that tech could offset those losses by topping-up with $5 worth of bitcoin every month.

- Until then, Brave plans to continue its work not only contributing to that lost revenue, but giving users an option to pay. In May of this year, Juniper Research forecast that ad-blocking technology would result $27bn in lost revenue by 2020. The future of ad-blocking Ad-blocking technology has gathered increasing support by courts around the world, and appears unlikely to be shut down anytime soon. Instead of letting that revenue slowly trickle away, Eich said Brave is only at the beginning of creating new ways to offset losses. Currently, a user's most popular websites are determined by page view, but Eich and his team are exploring new ways to generate that metric.

- One option is to measure time spent on each site, though more study is required to help ensure that a webpage that is displayed is actually being viewed.

- He tells CoinDesk Brave will never use eye-tracking technology. At launch, Brave plans to hold the monthly payments in escrow and send them in bulk to avoid bogging down the bitcoin network, which can only process about seven transactions per second. But in the future, he said improvements to the bitcoin infrastructure such as the Lightning Network and Segregated Witness could enable micropayments in real-time. Other changes that could appear in future releases might be additional currencies.

## Google Begins Rolling Out Android 7.0 Nougat

-  Google Begins Rolling Out Android 7.0 Nougat  (venturebeat.com) 

- An anonymous reader writes: Google today started rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to existing Nexus devices via an over-the-air software update.

- This is a gradual rollout: The Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C, and General Mobile 4G (Android One) will all be updated, but " it may take several weeks" before everyone gets the latest and greatest, a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat.The Nexus 5 (2013), which packs in a Snapdragon 800 SoC coupled with 2GB of RAM and 5-inch full-HD display, won't be receiving Android Nougat update -- despite having all the hardware capabilities required for a phone to receive Google's latest OS update.

- The truth of the matter is if Google wanted to update the Nexus 5 with the latest Android software, it could have.

- It's very likely that same will be the case for the Nexus 6, a phone that has 3GB of RAM, and Snapdragon 805 SoC, next year when the company releases Android O update.

## Blockchain Startup Chronicled Launches Ethereum IoT Registry

- Today, industry companies are each developing their own way for devices to communicate, but Chronicled's founders want to use the ethereum blockchain to make private IoT database registries interoperable. Chronicled CEO Ryan Orr told CoinDesk: "Whats missing is interoperability for all those chips so that when a consumer is out in the world, they can interact with their world in a ubiquitous, seamless way.

- " So far, Chronicled has deployed 10,000 NFC and BLE chips, most of which are embedded in limited edition sneakers or other apparel, and each device is matched with a record of identity on the ethereum blockchain to reduce counterfeiting of luxury items. Sneakers are the companys first use case, but the teams goal from day "zero", according to Orr, was to transition to other consumer goods and to expand to a public blockchain database. To achieve this, Chronicled is also collaborating with existing IoT companies, including semiconductor company Silicon Labs and Blue Bite, a New York-based BLE firm. Securing devices As with other startups in the industry, Orr said he sees blockchains as a way to enable a machine-to-machine economy by which devices can more easily, and safely, interact. "Machines need to have identities so that machines can come to a decision on whether or not to trust the other machine or to understand where its from, which services it might be able to offer," Orr argued. He offered the example whereby an Amazon drone would deliver a package through the window of a home.

- Using IoT devices, he said, the window could verify instantly whether or not the drone is safe, potentially with public information off of the Amazon website, and enable the drone to drop off real-world goods. "Verifying the identity of a device in a secure and public way is the first step to doing hundreds of different things on top of it," Orr said. A key attribute that makes blockchains primed for such use cases, according to the team, is that anyone can use it to register a device. This is something that third-party developers are more likely to want to build on, Orr asserted. Why ethereum With the announcement, the company is releasing tools for developers, including starter kits, SDKs and an Open Registry Explorer so that any developer can use the platform to tag devices themselves.

- In particular, he pointed to its flexibility and transparency, which he said helps with the companys goal of building an interoperable standard. "The ethereum project is at a critical mass globally.

- It could become a global standard in respect to product authentication," he said. Its also worth noting that ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is on board with the idea.

## How the NSA snooped on encrypted Internet traffic for a decade

-  In a revelation that shows how the National Security Agency was able to systematically spy on many Cisco Systems customers for the better part of a decade, researchers have uncovered an attack that remotely extracts decryption keys from the company's now-decommissioned line of PIX firewalls. The discovery is significant because the attack code, dubbed BenignCertain, worked on PIX versions Cisco released in 2002 and supported through 2009.

- Even after Cisco stopped providing PIX bug fixes in July 2009, the company continued offering limited service and support for the product for an additional four years.

- The exploit helps explain documents leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden and cited in a 2014 article that appeared in Der Spiegel.

- " The revelation is also concerning because data returned by the Shodan search engine indicate more than 15,000 networks around the world still use PIX, with the Russian Federation, the US, and Australia being the top three countries affected.

- The researchers, however, were able to make the key-extraction technique work against version 6.3(5) as well. Cisco representatives on Friday declined to comment on the revelation, citing the previously mentioned end-of-life policy.

## 75 Percent of Bluetooth Smart Locks Can Be Hacked

- It turns out, the majority of Bluetooth smart locks you see on the market can easily be hacked and opened by unauthorized users.

- The news comes from DEF CON hacker conference in Las Vegas, where security researchers revealed the vulnerability, adding that concerned OEMs are doing little to nothing to patch the hole.

- Tom's Guide reports: Researcher Anthony Rose, an electrical engineer, said that of 16 Bluetooth smart locks he and fellow researcher Ben Ramsey had tested, 12 locks opened when wirelessly attacked.

- The locks -- including models made by Quicklock, iBlulock, Plantraco, Ceomate, Elecycle, Vians, Okidokey and Mesh Motion -- had security vulnerabilities that ranged from ridiculously easy to moderately difficult to exploit.

- "We figured we'd find vulnerabilities in Bluetooth Low Energy locks, then contact the vendors.

## New Cloud Attack Takes Full Control of Virtual Machines With Little Effort

- Until now, Rowhammer has been a somewhat clumsy and unpredictable attack tool because it was hard to control exactly where data-corrupting bit flips happened.

- The odds of crucial data being stored in a susceptible memory location made such hacks largely a matter of chance that was stacked against the attacker.

- Now, computer scientists have developed a significantly more refined Rowhammer technique they call Flip Feng Shui.

- It manipulates deduplication operations that many cloud hosts use to save memory resources by sharing identical chunks of data used by two or more virtual machines.

-  The research paper titled "Flip Feng Shui: Hammering a Needle in the Software Stack" can be read here.

## New Intel and AMD Chips Will Only Support Windows 10

- An anonymous reader writes: Buried in the announcement of the new Kaby Lake (seventh-generation) processors and a rash of incoming notebooks set to use them is the confirmation that they will have a Windows 10 future.

- Microsoft has been warning people for ages that Kaby Lake will not run on anything older than Windows 10, and it looks like AMD's upcoming Zen chip will be going the same way.

- Microsoft said, "As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support.

- "We are committed to working with Microsoft and our ecosystem partners to help ensure a smooth transition given these changes to Microsoft's Windows support policy," an Intel spokesperson said.

- "AMD's processor roadmap is fully aligned with Microsoft's software strategy," AMD chief technical officer Mark Papermaster said, via a company spokeswoman. Slashdot reader MojoKid via HotHardware has some more details on Intel's Kaby Lake 7th Gen Core Series Processors for those yearning to learn more.

## Dropbox hackers stole e-mail addresses, hashed passwords from 68M accounts

-  Dropbox hurriedly warned its users last week to change their passwords if their accounts dated back prior to mid-2012.

- We now know why: the cloud-based storage service suffered a data breach that's said to have affected more than 68 million accounts compromised during a hack that took place roughly four years ago. The company had previously admitted that it was hit by a hack attack, but it's only now that the scale of the operation has seemingly come to light. Tech site Motherboard reportedciting "sources in the database trading community"that it had obtained four files, totalling 5GB in size, which apparently contained e-mail addresses and hashed passwords for 68,680,741 Dropbox users. A senior Dropbox employee was quoted as saying, unofficially, that the data was legit. The hack was later confirmed by Australian security expert Troy Huntthe man behind haveIbeenpwned.comwho claimed to have seen the data.

- After performing his own tests, he said: "There is no doubt whatsoever that the data breach contains legitimate Dropbox passwords.

- He said: Our analysis confirms that the credentials are user e-mail addresses with hashed and salted passwords that were obtained prior to mid-2012.

- The best way to do this is by updating these passwords, making them strong and unique, and enabling two-step verification. Individuals who received a notification from Dropbox should also be alert to spam or phishing. But the company hasn't publicly confirmed or denied that more than 68 million accounts had been compromised in the attack. Dropbox "seems to have handled this really well," Hunt added, noting that it had e-mailed everyone who was apparently affected, forcing password resets in a timely manner, and using a strong hashing algorithm to protect the information.

## Google has reportedly suspended Project Ara, its modular smartphone effort

- Axing Project Ara is one of the first steps in a campaign to unify Googles various hardware efforts, which range from Chromebook laptops to Nexus phones.

- Modular smartphones have generated great enthusiasm in the tech community for their potential to prolong the lifespan of a device and reduce electronic waste.

- But the devices are difficult to bring to market because their interchangeable parts make them bulky and costly to produce, said analyst Bob ODonnell of TECHnalysis Research, adding that he was not surprised to see Google halt the project.

- Last year, the company shelved plans to sell the modular phone in Puerto Rico with Latin American carriers.

- Exclusive: HP Enterprise in talks to sell software unit to Thoma Bravo - sources Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE)  is in talks with buyout firm Thoma Bravo LLC to sell its software division, hoping it can fetch between $8 billion and $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

## 43M passwords hacked in Last.fm breach

-  Crikey: 43,570,999 user accounts were breached in a hack of Last.fm that occurred in March of 2012, according to a report from LeakedSource.

- Three months after the breach, in June of 2012, Last.fm issued the following statement:  We are currently investigating the leak of some Last.fm user passwords.

- This follows recent password leaks on other sites, as well as information posted online.

- Salting is the practice of adding a random string of numbers to the hash for each individual password, making them more secure and decreasing the likelihood that they will be cracked if the passwords are ever leaked online.

- Seriously, its 2016 people  use a platform like LastPass to generate randomized, complex passwords that are unique to every service for which you sign up.

## Meet USBee, the malware that uses USB drives to covertly jump airgaps

-  In 2013, a document leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden illustrated how a specially modified USB device allowed spies to surreptitiously siphon data out of targeted computers, even when they were physically severed from the Internet or other networks.

- Similar airgap-jumping attacks from the same team include AirHopper, which turns a computer's video card into an FM transmitter; BitWhisper, which relies on the exchange of heat-induced "thermal pings"; GSMem, which relies on cellular frequencies; and Fansmitter, which uses noise emitted by a computer fan to transmit data. In 2013, researchers with Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing, and Ergonomics devised a technique that used inaudible audio signals to covertly transmit keystrokes and other sensitive data from air-gapped machines. As Ars has noted in previous coverage, the techniques are theoretically effective, but their utility in real-world situations is limited.

- Still, in certain cases, the air-gap jumpers could provide a crucial means to bypass otherwise insurmountable defenses when combined with other techniques in a targeted attack. USBee works by sending USB drives a sequence of "0" in a way that causes the devices to generate detectable emissions at frequencies between the 240 megahertz and 480 Mhz.

- The radio receiver requires about $30 worth of hardware to work. The growing body of airgap research highlights how important it is to develop special policies that go well beyond physically severing network connections when securing computers deemed highly sensitive.

- Such computers should, among other things, also be kept in restricted areas free of unauthorized electronic equipment, include antivirus or intrusion prevention systems that detect anomalous behavior, and be shielded from electromagnetic emissions. Again, a tool like USBee is highly specialized and useful only in the rarified world of state-sponsored spies and high-stakes corporate espionage.

## L0phtCrack's back! Crack hack app whacks Windows 10 trash hashes

- Ancient famed Windows cracker L0phtCrack has been updated after seven years, with the release of the "fully revamped" version seven. The password cracker was first released 19 years ago gaining much popularity in hacker circles and leading Microsoft to change the way it handled password security at the time.  

- No new versions have been released since version six in March 2009, launched at the Source Boston conference. The latest iteration sports a revamped cracking engine designed to exploit modern multi-core CPUs and GPUs, blitzing the previous version's time to crack four-core CPUs by at least a factor of five. However, users with expensive GPUs such as the AMD Radeon Pro Duo could see it work a whopping 500 times faster than the previous version. The increase in speed was not matched by Microsoft, which still relies on NTLM password hashing. So outgunned is Microsoft that password cracking is easier now than it was nearly two decades ago when L0phtCrack first landed, according to founding former L0phtCrack team members Christien Rioux, Chris Wysopal, and Peiter Mudge Zatko who run L0pht Holdings. "[L0phtCrack's] password cracking capability forced Microsoft to make improvements to the way Windows stored password hashes," L0pht Holdings says. "Microsoft eventually deprecated the weak LANMAN password hash and switched to the stronger NTLM password hash it still uses today ... yet hardware and password cracking algorithms have improved greatly in the intervening years. "The new release of L0phtCrack 7 demonstrates that current Windows passwords are easier to crack today than they were 18 years ago when Microsoft started making much needed password strength improvements.

- " A 1998 Pentium II 400 MHz CPU computer running version one of L0phtCrack would take a day to crack an eight-character long alphanumeric Windows NT password.

- " The group point to a study which found shoddy domain user passwords were the way in for most penetration testers, most of the time. To that end L0phtCrack 7 is pitched as a means for admins and testers to audit Windows domain passwords to quickly find weak passwords in a few hours. The revamped app also sports a shiny GUI and auditing wizard, plus scheduling and reporting.

- It works with all versions of Windows and supports new types of UNIX password hashes, and will work with other password importers and crackers using a plug in feature. There is not yet a consensus on password selection best practice. Microsoft and Google boffins reckon passwords should be pronounceable, rather than set to the typical recommended jumble of numbers, special characters, and letters, which are difficult for users to recall. Britain's GCHQ spy agency reckons admins ought to stop punishing users with regular password resets, which studies show leads to weaker combinations being set over time. Password strength meters are junk, Compound Eye developer Mark Stockley said, since it does not help against predictable and cliche logins that can be easily guessed. Last month Docker's security lead Diogo Monica (@diogomonica) rubbished the popular password choice and complexity debate saying password managers should be used to generate set unique jumbled credentials for all sites.

## George W Bush hacker Guccifer to spend 52 months in the big house

- Notorious celebrity hacker Guccifer will spend at least four years in prison on charges of identity theft and unauthorized access to computer systems. Guccifer  in real life, taxi driver Marcel Lehel Lazar, 44, of Romania  was sentenced today by US district court judge James Cacheris after hearing of Lazar's lack of remorse, the likelihood of him doing it all over again, and his unwillingness to cooperate with US authorities.  

- Lazar pleaded guilty to the charges earlier this year after he was arrested in Arad, Romania, and hauled into a Virginia courthouse in America. Guccifer has long claimed responsibility for a hacking spree from 2012 to 2014 during which he broke into personal email inboxes and hijacked social media accounts of more than 100 people.

- He also claimed to have infiltrated Hillary Clinton's email server, though authorities have disputed that boast. "Lazar's victims included an immediate family member of two former US presidents, a former member of the US Cabinet, a former member of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and a former presidential advisor, he admitted," the Department of Justice said in announcing the sentencing. "In many instances, Lazar publicly released his victims' private email correspondence, medical and financial information, and personal photographs, according to the statement of facts filed with his plea agreement.

- Guccifer also revealed that Hillary Clinton used a private email address while she was secretary of state. Lazar also has to complete a seven-year sentence in his home country, where he was convicted on separate charges for hacking the accounts of Romanian government officials.

- The miscreant may be released from his US federal prison in 2018 to finish that stretch back in Romania before returning to America to complete his time behind bars.

## SingularDTV: A Decentralized Netflix on Ethereum

- The team behind SingularDTV, a blockchain-based digital content distribution and management platform, is planning the launch of a decentralized system in which artists and digital content creators can build, monetize, protect and manage their creations using the blockchain technology.Based on the Ethereum network and the ConsenSys venture production studio, SingularDTV relies on a tokenized ecosystem using a local cryptocurrency called SNGLS to help artists and creators benefit from transparent media production and distribution.Essentially, the SingularDTV platform aims to construct a decentralized entertainment industry in which content creators have complete control over their creations and monetization methods.

- Its four core divisions  content creation  acquisition, documentary division, rights management platform and TVOD Brand/Portal  allow creators to display, distribute and produce films, television properties and music while protecting their copyrights in one single platform.The SingularDTV team and its CEO Zach Lebeau believe that the platform will lead to the development of new monetization methods and will eliminate monopolistic distribution that inevitably lessens the profit of artists and filmmakers.It [the platform] will give artists control over setting usage policies for their created content and pay them instantaneously when their content is watched, rather than having to participate in the monopolistic and obfuscated distribution machine of the legacy entertainment industry that ends up eating away at their potential profits, Lebeau told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview.Joseph Lubin, CTO of SingularDTV, further emphasized that artists and filmmakers will be able to maximize their earnings by eliminating the presence of third-party institutions or mediators like Netflix and YouTube to manage and distribute their content.

- The platform is gearing towards a consumer-to-creator network in which consumers may access the creators works without accessing an external application.Through the utilization of smart contracts, consumers will be able to make payments according to the indications of each smart contract of the creators.A consumer will be able to navigate and catalogue and find something to watch and click on an appropriate usage policy to pay the artist instantly and directly for the content that were receiving and using, said Lubin.Importance of Ethereum and Local TokensBefore Ethereum was introduced to the digital currency industry, Lebeau and his team attempted to utilize the Bitcoin network and ecosystem to build the SingularDTV platform.

- This is the beginning of a next great tech boom where trillions of dollars worth of real world assets will be decentralized and placed onto the blockchain in the coming years.

- SNGLS tokens are the decentralized representation of SingularDTV intellectual property  our film, TV and software projects.

## Half Of People Click Anything Sent To Them

- Half of the people will click on anything without thinking twice ArsTechnica reports: A study by researchers at a university in Germany found that about half of the subjects in a recent experiment clicked on links from strangers in e-mails and Facebook messages -- even though most of them claimed to be aware of the risks.

- Simulated "spear phishing" attacks were sent to 1,700 test subjects -- university students -- from fake accounts.

- The e-mail and Facebook accounts were set up with the ten most common names in the age group of the targets.

- The messages claimed the links were to photos taken at a New Year's Eve party held a week before the study.

- Links sent resolved to a webpage with the message "access denied," but the site logged the clicks by each student.

## Build a Tiny (Unstable) Bugging Device

-  We dont know who the [amgworkshop] wanted to listen in on, but they apparently went searching for a small FM wireless transmitter.

- The original circuit had a variable capacitor to tune the output frequency.

- You can see the build steps in the video below, but dont expect a lot of frequency stability or fidelity out of a single transistor transmitter. The parts list is minimal.

- In addition to a coin cell holder (which serves as the construction base), you need a transistor, two resistors, three capacitors, a homemade inductor (very easy to make with some wire and a drill bit), and an electret microphone.

- If you want a better circuit (and longer battery life) you might look at [Angelos] similar build.
