## Plane diverted as passengers fight over seat reclining

- A plane in the US had to be diverted and two passengers removed after one of them started a fight by using a banned device to stop the seat in front reclining.

- one passenger was using the Knee Defender, a $21.95 lock that attaches to a tray table and jams the reclining mechanism of the seat in front.

- male passenger, seated in a middle seat of row 12, used the device to stop the woman in front of him reclining while he was on his laptop

- A flight attendant asked him to remove the device and he refused.

- The woman then stood up, turned around and threw a cup of water at him, the official said.

- The Federal Aviation Administration leaves it up to individual airlines to set rules about the device. United Airlines says it prohibits its use, like all major US airlines.

## SMBlog -- 2 June 2015

- Facebook just announced support for PGP, an encrypted email standard, for email from them to you

- The first question, of course, is why Facebook has done this.

- The nasty cynical part of me thinks it's an anti-Google measure; if email to users is encrypted, gmail won't be able to read it

- Can they find a way to make PGP easy to use?

- The third big question is mobile device suppor

- The last and most interesting question is why they opted for PGP instead of S/MIME

## USA Freedom Act Passes: What We Celebrate, What We Mourn, and Where We Go From Here

- The weakening amendments to the legislation proposed by NSA defender Senate Majority Mitch McConnell were defeated, and we have every reason to believe that President Obama will sign USA Freedom into law.

- Lawmakers have feared that technology usersorganized, politically-savvy, articulate, and educated about the law and its effects on techwould strike out to stop their misguided legislative efforts.

- Passing a bill is far more difficult than simply killing a bad bill, and takes more sustained pressure from the public, a massive publicity campaign around a central issue, deep connections to lawmakers, and the coordination of diverse groups from across the political spectrum. The USA Freedom Act shows that the digital rights community has leveled up.

- But whatever happens, we will continue fighting in the courts to ensure that the government does not exceed its statutory authority to spy or violate our constitutional rights. We fought hard to get to this moment in history.

- We extend our thanks to all of our supporters across the globe who fought so hard to bring us to this historic moment, and we look forward to working alongside you as we continue to curb abuses by the surveillance state in the years to come.

## Quiz: Just how Kafkaesque is the court that oversees NSA spying?

-   An undated file photo of famed author Franz Kafka.

- Founded in 1978 after the Watergate scandal and investigations by the Church Committee, the FISA court was supposed to be a bulwark against secret government surveillance.

- In 2006, it authorized the NSA call records program  the single largest domestic surveillance program in American history. The court in Franz Kafkas novel The Trial is a shadowy tribunal that tries (and executes) Josef K., the storys protagonist, without informing him of the crime hes charged with, the witnesses against him, or how he can defend himself.

- A few months before the Snowden disclosures, four senators asked the FISA court to declassify summaries of some of those opinions.

## How the end of Patriot Act provisions changes NSA surveillance

-  Trevor Paglen  Thanks to resistance from Senator Rand Paul and other members of the Senate, the provisions of the USA PatriotAct that were used to justify the National Security Administrations broad collection of phone call metadata have expired.

- The USA Freedom Act, in the form it was passed by the House of Representatives, would put the phone companies in charge of retaining call dataand allow the NSA to query that data where it rests. According to a letter sent by NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers to Senators Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Harry Reid (D-Nev.), shifting to a query at the provider model is achievable within 180 days, with provider cooperation.

- We are aware of no technical or security reasons why this cannot be tested and brought on line within the 180-day period [specified by the USA Freedom Act]. The NSA is very familiar with distributed query models that would be required for the new approach to worktheyre at the core of XKeyscore.

- If anything, it might actually help reduce the demands on the NSAs network connections to telco providers. XKeyscore currently provides a federated search capability that can query its data stores around the world for information related to a specific identifier.

- If the only real changes are to where the data is stored, metadata queries will still potentially be open to abuses such as those already documented by the NSAquerying phone metadata of girlfriends and ex-girlfriends, boyfriends and wives, and other random individuals. In other words, the technical substance of NSA phone record surveillance may change, but the capabilities will not.

## China cracks down further on VPNs as censorship intensifies

- Chinas government is cracking down further on the use of virtual private networks to circumnavigate its Great Firewall, as part of the ongoing game of whack-a-mole between censors and an increasingly tech-savvy population. Charlie Smith, co-founder of the censorship in China monitoring site GreatFire.org, said there has been a significant increase in the usage of VPN services over the last year.

- The knock-on effects of this can be seen through increased activity on blocked sites such as Twitter. However, Smith said the authorities have recently cracked down hard on the most popular commercial VPNs. New upstarts might garner the same attention once they hit critical masses of users.

- I hope that this does not happen, but recent trends indicate that this will be the likely end result. According to sources, the countrys hugely popular online shopping platform Taobao no longer sells VPNs, with keyword searches for the services now blocked.

- A search on Chinas Baidu reveals more people are asking where to buy VPNs, although there are still plenty of sites selling them. Adam Fisk, chief executive of free peer-to-peer internet censorship circumvention software Lantern, said VPNs are particularly vulnerable to blocking because censors can easily target their protocols. In contrast Lantern uses a combination of peer-to-peer overseas connections and tunnelling traffic through services censors dont want to block. To me this is an ongoing battle with continuing innovation on both sides.

- The service now has 500 million active users, raising the question of how practical it is becoming to police. Fisk said: I definitely think theres a danger of being too optimistic, but [ultimately] the government is fighting a battle against hundreds of millions of people who have a fundamental desire to access information and programmers who have a fundamental desire to innovate. Over the long term I think the latter will clearly win, but its unclear how long it will take, he added. Smith agreed: [We] believe that a combination of technological solutions and widespread adoption of these tools will make free access to information so commonplace that the authorities decide that there is no point in fighting back.

## Evil Wi-Fi captive portal could spoof Apple Pay to get users credit card data

- The vulnerability, based on the default behavior of iOS devices with Wi-Fi turned on, could be used to inject a fake captive portal page that imitates the Apple Pay interface. The attack leverages a well-known issue Ars has reported on in the past: iOS devices with Wi-Fi turned on will attempt by default to connect to any access point with a known SSID.

- A rogue access point could use a probe request capture to masquerade as a known network, and then throw up a pop-up screen masquerading as any web page or app. The Wandera attack uses this behavior to get a mobile device to connect and then presents a pop-up portal pagethe type usually used when connecting to a public WiFi service to present a Web-based login screenthat is designed to resemble an Apple Pay screen for entering credit card data.

- Using readily available technology, which they may be discretely carrying about their person, hackers can for the first time focus their efforts where their victims are at their most susceptibleat the checkout. The real vulnerability exploited here is iOS automatic WiFi connection and the format in which iOS displays captive portal pages.

- The Wandera researchers reccommended that Apple and Google should consider adopting a secure warning when displaying captive portal pages to users, so that users exercise caution. Additionally, they suggest that users close and re-open payment applications to enter credit card data and use the camera capture capability of the apps to input credit card data whenever possible. Ars spoke with an Apple spokesperson, and is awaiting an official response.

- However, as the screenshots show, this spoof looks considerably different from Apple Pays actual interface, and a card registration screen popping up after a transaction is hardly expected behavior for the service.

## Federal agency hit by Chinese hackers, around 4 million employees affected

- The Office of Personnel Management, the government agency that manages federal employees, announced Thursday that its network was breached in December 2014, potentially compromising the personal records of approximately 4 million former and current employees.

- The Washington Post, citing unnamed government officials, reported that the attack originated from Chinese hackers, and was the second major intrusion of the agency by China in less than a year.

- OPM has instituted additional network security precautions, including: restricting remote access for network administrators and restricting network administration functions remotely; a review of all connections to ensure that only legitimate business connections have access to the internet; and deploying anti-malware software across the environment to protect and prevent the deployment or execution of tools that could compromise the network.

## FBI: Apple and Google are helping ISIS by offering strong crypto

- Apple and Google are helping terrorism by offering users encrypted communications, a senior FBI official has told the House Homeland Security Committee in Congress, and US law enforcement needs to stop them from doing it. Michael Steinbach, assistant director in the FBIs Counterterrorism Division, told Congress that ISIS and other terrorist groups are using commercially available encryption technology to mask their activities, leading law enforcement surveillance to go dark.

- As far as the FBI is concerned, private companies must build technological solutions to prevent encryption above all else, the Washington Post reports Steinbach as saying. Thats a pretty sharp reverse ferret from the FBI, which four years ago was recommending encryption as a basic security measure.

- But Steinbach said evildoers are hiding behind US-made technology to mask their actions. Encryption appears to be a big problem for law enforcement, both foreign and domestic.

- But the FBI wasnt insisting on back door access to encryption; rather, it wants companies to work directly with law enforcement where necessary. Privacy above all other things, including safety and freedom from terrorism, is not where we want to go, Steinbach said.

- But the intelligence community is wedded to the idea that it should be easy to build an encryption system thats both secure and has a breakable access code. The problem is that the best minds in the field say doing so is mathematically impossible, and even if it were possible, youd be painting a target on your back by telling the world theres a hack available and daring them to find it.

## Typing 'http://:' Into a Skype Message Trashes the Installation Beyond Repair

- So much this. I usually defend MS against people who I believe unfairly attack them, but you've really struck a nerve. I don't know what team is responsible for Skype, but they have done such a mind boggling horrible job I'm half convinced they're intentionally trying to kill it, cut it into small pieces, then burn the remains before firing the ashes into the nearest black hole. Every single version they push out has been worse than the last, and the last good version was 6.18.

- Somehow it managed to uninstall itself and then couldn't reinstall itself because I replaced the update file with a dummy. They keep removing features but *promise* to put them back in... And even years later the features still haven't back in added.

- That's all Skype gets nowadays, useless improvements and worse performance.

- The calls I get with 6.18 are perfect but with any version 7 I may as well just write letters and send them through the mail. Oh but wait they changed the UI to be even worse!

- Maybe you should hire actual software developers instead of monkey interns who think smashing their face into a keyboard is an acceptable way to write software.

## Bing to encrypt search traffic by default

- 

- Microsoft product manager Duane Forrester says it will encrypt all Bing search traffic later this year. Forrester says the move follows Cupertinos 2014 decision to allow users to opt-in to HTTPS for web searches.

- Beginning this (Northern hemisphere) summer, we will begin the process of encrypting search traffic by default, Forrester blogged. This means that traffic originating from Bing will increasingly come from https as opposed to http. Microsoft will also drop query search terms from referrers strings in a bid to further shore up privacy. Web ad bods will be able to learn the queries that lead users to their pages through Microsofts search terms report, universal event tracking, and webmaster tools.  While this change may impact marketers and webmasters, we believe that providing a more secure search experience for our users is important, Forrester says. The HTTPS move brings Microsoft up to speed with Google which began encrypting search traffic in 2011 making it compulsory in 2013, and Yahoo!

- which deployed HTTPS for its search in 2014. Encrypting search traffic and other non-sensitive web traffic is seen widely by privacy and security pundits as necessary to a more safer web.

## Chinese snoops try tracking VPN users with fiendish JSONP trickery

- The attacks exploits vulnerabilities in the top Chinese websites, including those run by Baidu and Alibaba, and use cross-site request forgery to expose users accessing restricted sites.

- The JavaScript file exploits JSONP hijacking vulnerabilities in more than 15 different major Chinese websites, including the top five portals used in China

- It looks like this campaign has been targeting a very small group of people, and since there is no financial gain on collecting most of the leaked personal data, we can say that whoever is behind these attacks is looking to reveal the identity of the users visiting certain websites.

- However, bypassing the same-origin policy can lead to information leakage between different origins or domains. Since JSONP requests/responses bypass the same-origin policy, malicious sites can cause victims to make cross-domain JSONP requests and read the private data using the script tag. The GFW is able to analyze and block traffic that is leaving China, although these controls can be circumvented by Chinese users running VPNs or TOR.

- In these cases, the GFW doesnt have full visibility into the traffic that goes through VPNs or TOR. VPN users are more at risk than Tor browser users because of restrictions in handling JavaScript by the latter, as pointed out by the Tor Project, and reflected in an update to AlienVaultults blog post. The hacking attack outlined by AlienVault lifts the veil of anonymity, at least partially.

## Cops turn Download Festival into an ORWELLIAN SPY PARADISE

- 

- As if being ankle deep in a muddy field, surrounded by pretend hippies seemingly re-enacting highlights of the Battle of Waterloo was bad enough, attendees of the aptly named Download Festival will be subjected to a new police facial recognition system, and surveillance of their onsite location and expenditure via the debut of RFID wristbands. The surveillance technologies are a new facial recognition system being rolled out by Leicestershire Police, and Downloads own RFID wristbands, provided by German RFID specialists YouChip.

- Leicestershire Police have been trialling NEC Corporations NeoFace facial recognition system since April 2014, though they only announced the trial in July of that year, and seem to have been delighted with its results to date. NeoFace has compared facial images, captured by CCTV/IPTV recordings, with facial images stored in Leicestershires local custody database. NEC, however, advertises its NeoFace tech as being able to offer much more in biometrics surveillance, and while the particular system to be used at Download has not been revealed, it may also be part of the companys suite. NeoFace Watch is the mobile surveillance platform from the NeoFace suite, which functions by integrating face matching technology with video surveillance input, while checking individuals against known photographic watch lists, and producing real-time alerts, according to a product brochure. An interview with DC Kevin Walker, published in Police Oracle on Monday, revealed that: Strategically placed cameras will scan faces at the Download Festival site in Donington before comparing [them] with a database of custody images from across Europe. The Register has been told that the database of lawfully held European custody photos is a stand-alone database of legally held custody photographs drawn together with partners in Europol. In response to a Freedom of Information request The Reg filed to Leicestershire Police in April asking whether NeoFace had, or could, utilise information received from outside of its custody database  making specific reference to SIS II  we were told: NeoFace has been intentionally limited in scope to ensure that it only uses images held on our custody database.

- It is a stand-alone system that does not link with other national databases such as the PNC. This is true, The Register understands, as the real-time facial recognition system is being considered as a totally different project from the existing facial recognition system that the coppers are using. We have also learned that the Police Oracles publication of the interview caused significant upset for management at Leicestershire Police, who did not want any advance publicity of their new surveillance project. The public would have been informed that it had been placed under surveillance after the event had ended, presumably as part of a you didnt know, therefore it wasnt intrusive, justification for the scheme.

## Android Wear Security Analysis - mwrlabs

- Motivated by the rise in popularity of wearable devices, MWR decided to perform a security review of Android Wear running on the LG G watch.

- private ServiceConnection connection = new ServiceConnection() { public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName className, IBinder iservice) { Log.d(TAG, "onServiceConnected: " + className.getClassName); } public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName className) { Log.d(TAG, "onServiceDisconnected"); } } bindService is an asynchronous method, the second argument to which is an object containing methods which will be called when the service is available.

- According to Google2: The Android SDK tools generate an interface in the Java programming language, based on your .aidl file.

- onTransact takes several arguments, an integer representing which method to call, along with Parcel objects containing data.

- This means the security check will fail if the UID does not belong to the package name specified and a security exception will occur. Conclusion This research aimed to discover how Android Wear applications communicate and whether there are controls in place which stop non-privileged malware from delivering messages to arbitrary applications.

## How to hijack MILLIONS of Samsung mobes with man-in-the-middle diddle

- Samsung smartphones can be hijacked, infected with malware, and remotely controlled by malicious Wi-Fi hotspots in cafes, hotels, and so on, security researchers claim. According to the bods at NowSecure, millions of handsets have a remote-code execution vulnerability that is a software design flaw.

- Essentially, NowSecure claims, the touchscreen keyboard app bundled with Samsung Galaxy S6, S5, S4 and S4 Mini handsets automatically updates itself by downloading a ZIP file of new files from the internet using an unencrypted HTTP connection. It makes no attempt to verify the authenticity of the archive, its claimed, so someone in control of your network could intercept the download, and send the phone a malicious archive instead. The update process runs with system-level access.

- This means a malicious archive could overwrite arbitrary files on the handset, replacing the installed software with malware, or just cause havoc, were told. The ZIP archive is downloaded from  http://skslm.swiftkey.net/samsung/downloads/v1.3-USA/az_AZ.zip  and if, for example, it contains a file with the full filename  ../../../../../../../../data/payload  then, when unpacked by the update process, it will create a system-owned file in the directory /data:  $ su -c "ls -l /data/payload" -rw------- system   system          5 2014-08-22 16:07 payload  Which is bad. The system keyboard app cannot be uninstalled, and if deactivated and replaced by another on-screen keyboard app, it will continue to run its update process in the background with full system privileges every so often. Its unfortunate but typical for OEMs and carriers to preinstall third-party applications to a device, NowSecure researcher Ryan Welton wrote in a blog post.

- This is the case with the keyboard on Samsung. This vulnerability is specific to Samsung devices, and we have observed it as far back as Android 4.2 and possibly even farther back, a spokesman for NowSecure added to The Register. SwiftKey provided the software at the heart of Samsungs system keyboard, and said its standalone keyboard apps are not vulnerable. Weve seen reports of a security issue related to the Samsung stock keyboard that uses the SwiftKey SDK, a spokesperson told El Reg on Tuesday. We can confirm that the SwiftKey Keyboard app available via Google Play or the Apple App Store is not affected by this vulnerability.

## Serious OS X and iOS flaws let hackers steal keychain, 1Password contents

- But roughly speaking, such malware can do no more (and actually considerably less) than what a malicious browser extension could do in your browser. Goldberg, whose company develops and markets 1Password, went on to advise users how to make themselves less susceptible to the attack and to thank the researchers for exposing the problem. Password stealing is when a malicious app exploits a subtle design weakness in the OS X keychain, which stores passwords and other credentials used by browsers and other apps.

- Once the end user enters it again, the malicious app will be able to retrieve it. A video demonstration of the attack follows: Keychain attack demo: steal iCloud authentication token.  Container cracking: Containers are designed to store the contacts, passwords, and other contents in highly restricted directories and subdirectories named after the BID assigned to the sandboxed app.

- The researchers malicious app was able to take ownership of the Wunderlist URL scheme and then steal the Google Single Sign On login credential transmitted by the browser.

- Interestingly, they said application sandboxing in Googles Android OS was much better at withstanding XARA threats. For the time being, the researchers told Ars, there isnt much end users can do except wait for Apple to fix the vulnerabilities.

- At the request of Apple, the researchers delayed disclosing their findings for six months to give developers a head start in hardening OS X and iOS against the attacks.

## Apples Password Storing Keychain Cracked on iOS & OS X

- And another password shocker, a few days after cloud password service LastPass was pretty seriously hacked (yah if youre using it, change your master password) critical 0-day flaws in Apples password storing keychain have been exposed.  Which is kinda funny, as after the LastPass hack I saw some people espousing the usage of Apples keychain as much more secure.

- And now, Apples keychain cracked  and in a really serious way. Six university researchers have revealed deadly zero-day flaws in Apples iOS and OS X, claiming it is possible to crack Apples password-storing keychain, break app sandboxes, and bypass its App Store security checks. Attackers can steal passwords from installed apps, including the native email client, without being detected, by exploiting these bugs. The team was able to upload malware to the Apple app store, passing the vetting process without triggering alerts.

- That malware, when installed on a victims device, raided the keychain to steal passwords for services including iCloud and the Mail app, and all those stored within Google Chrome. Lead researcher Luyi Xing told El Reg he and his team complied with Apples request to withhold publication of the research for six months, but had not heard back as of the time of writing. They say the holes are still present in Apples software, meaning their work will likely be consumed by attackers looking to weaponize the work. Apple was not available for immediate comment. Its pretty serious as they managed to bypass the app store vetting and can grab access tokens and data from other apps on the device including high profile apps like Facebook, Evernote and iCloud itself even while sandboxed. The sad part is, Apple was notified about this 6 months ago and still havent fixed it  the only fast moving response came from Googles Chromium security team who removed keychain integration for Chrome, noting that it could likely not be solved at the application level. Recently we discovered a set of surprising security vulnerabilities in Apples Mac OS and iOS that allows a malicious app to gain unauthorised access to other apps sensitive data such as passwords and tokens for iCloud, Mail app and all web passwords stored by Google Chrome, Xing told The Registers security desk. Our malicious apps successfully went through Apples vetting process and was published on Apples Mac app store and iOS app store. We completely cracked the keychain service  used to store passwords and other credentials for different Apple apps  and sandbox containers on OS X, and also identified new weaknesses within the inter-app communication mechanisms on OS X and iOS which can be used to steal confidential data from Evernote, Facebook and other high-profile apps. The team was able to raid banking credentials from Google Chrome on the latest OS X 10.10.3, using a sandboxed app to steal the systems keychain data and secret iCloud tokens, and passwords from password vaults. If any malicious teams are out there using this, it could be really bad  and well if they arent already using it my bet is they will be by tomorrow. I guess itll probably be blocked from the app store by then though, now its getting widespread media coverage.

## Apple CORED: Boffins reveal password-killer 0-days for iOS and OS X

-  Photos were stolen from WeChat, and the token for popular cloud service Evernote was nabbed, allowing it to be fully compromised. The consequences are dire, the team wrote in the paper. Some 88.6 per cent of 1,612 OS X and 200 iOS apps were found completely exposed to unauthorized cross-app resource access (XARA) attacks allowing malicious apps to steal otherwise secure data. Xing says he reported the flaws to Apple in October 2014. 

-  Apple security bods responded to the researchers in emails seen by El Reg expressing understanding for the gravity of the attacks, and asked for at least six months to fix the problems.

- In February, the Cupertino staffers requested an advanced copy of the research paper. Googles Chromium security team was more responsive, and removed keychain integration for Chrome, noting that it could likely not be solved at the application level. AgileBits, owner of popular software 1Password, said it could not find a way to ward off the attacks nor make the malware work harder some four months after it was warned of the vulnerabilities.

- (Neither we nor Luyi Xing and his team have been able to figure out a completely reliable way to solve this problem, said AgileBitss Jeffrey Goldberg in a blog post today.

- The researchers found security-critical vulnerabilities including cross-app resource-sharing mechanisms and communications channels such as the keychain, WebSocket and Scheme. Note that not only does our attack code circumvent the OS-level protection but it can also get through the restrictive app vetting process of the Apple Stores, completely defeating its multi-layer defense, the researchers wrote in the paper. They say almost all XARA flaws arise from Apples cross-app resource sharing and communication mechanisms such as keychain for sharing passwords, BID based separation, and URL scheme for app invocation, which is different from how the Android system works. Their research, previously restricted to Android, would lead to a new line of work for the security community studying how the vulnerabilities affect Apple and other platforms. Heres the boffins description of their work: Our study brings to light a series of unexpected, security-critical aws that can be exploited to circumvent Apples isolation protection and its App Stores security vetting.

## But ... but iOS 9 could BLOCK my Ad-Block, dev squeals

- Apple appears to have added an ad-blocking capability to iOS 9, stoking hopes and fears in different quarters. The beta version of the operating system sports a Content Blocking Safari Extensions feature which Apple says will give extensions a fast and efficient way to block cookies, images, resources, pop-ups, and other content.

- It doesnt contain ad blocking capabilties as such and instead required ad blocking software to be installed - and to interact with Safari via JSON. Your app extension is responsible for supplying a JSON file to Safari.

- The JSON consists of an array of rules (triggers and actions) for blocking specified content, Apples developer notes say. Safari converts the JSON to bytecode, which it applies efficiently to all resource loads without leaking information about the users browsing back to the app extension.

- Xcode includes a Content Blocker App Extension template that contains code to send your JSON file to Safari. But the feature could kill popular advertising blockers, according to Sebastian Noack of Ad-Block - depending on whether it forces the apps to rely on inferior mechanisms. Noack says the JSON file block lists is a large departure from the current framework of running arbitray code on request to kill advertising based on URLs and context. We appreciate and support Apples attempts to finally catch up on extensions, but those latest changes will create either the best possible landscape for Safari extensions, or the worst  especially for Adblock Plus, Noack says. In short, either this new API will improve Adblock Plus performance on Safari or it will force us to rely upon an inferior blocking format that would essentially kill adblocking on Safari. So, we are nervously awaiting how powerful their block lists will be, most importantly when it comes to matching the document domain and request type, as well as regular expression matching of URLs and recursive exception rules. The mechanism will at best allow for a solid iOS advertising blocker or at worst mean the end of the facility on the operating system. It is yet uncertain if the feature is operational as of publication of this article.

## US Teen Pleads Guilty To Teaching ISIS About Bitcoin Via Twitter

- Through @AmreekiWitness the defendant discussed methods to provide financial support for those wanting to commit jihad and for those individuals trying to travel overseas.c.

- The defendant tweeted that the khilafah needed an official website "ASAP," and that ISIL could not continue to release media "in the wild" or use "JustPaste."

- Through various tweets, the defendant provided information on how to prevent the website from being taken down, by adding security and defenses, and he solicited others via Twitter to assist on the development of the website.7.

- The defendant used these accounts extensively as a platform to proselytize his radical Islamic ideology, justify and defend ISIL's violent practices, and to provide advice on topics such as jihadists travel to fight with ISIL, online security measures, and about how to use Bitcoin to finance themselves without creating evidence of crime, among other matters.8.

- On this blog, the defendant authored a series of highly-technical articles targeted at aspiring jihadists and ISIL supporters detailing the use of security measures in online communications to include use of encryption and anonymity software, tools and techniques, as well as the use of the virtual currency Bitcoin as a means to anonymously fund ISIL.9.
