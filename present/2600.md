## Router creds admin/admin? Lizard Squad thanks you

- Lizard Squad are using insecure home routers for a paid service that floods target networks, researchers say.

- The service crawls the web looking for home and commercial routers secured using lousy default cred

- to embedded devices that accept inbound telnet connections.

- operator of a large Tor exit relay cluster reported that his servers may have been physically interfered with

- a large number of small exit relays were created all at once, in what appeared to be a Sybil attack

- this was detected and halted almost immediately

## Kodak-Branded Smartphones On the Way

- The present-day Kodak is still the same company

- They went into bankruptcy protection, were forced to sell some things off, (***) and then emerged from that about 18 months ago

- it's unclear how much- if any- involvement Kodak themselves will have in the manufacture of this phone

## Worlds first (known) bootkit for OS X can permanently backdoor Macs

- Thunderstrike

- replaces the digital signature Apple uses to ensure only authorized firmware runs on Macs

- no known instances of bootkits for OS X in the wild

- can control the system from the very first instruction

- there are few viable ways to disinfect infected boot systems.

- bypass firmware passwords, passwords users enter to decrypt hard drives and to preinstall backdoors in the operating system before it starts running

- it will survive both reformatting and OS reinstallation

[http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/01/worlds-first-known-bootkit-for-os-x-can-permanently-backdoor-macs/](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/01/worlds-first-known-bootkit-for-os-x-can-permanently-backdoor-macs/)

## Chinese Counterintelligence Doesn't Fool Around

- Typist sentenced to death in China for leaking military secrets

- Worker said to have sold secrets about centre researching secret weapon to an unnamed foreign intelligence agency

## Inside North Korea's Naenara Browser

- very time the browser loads, its first move is to make a request to a non-routable IP address, http://10.76.1.11./

- The Naenara browser is part of the Red Star operating system

- it's a derivative of an outdated version of Mozilla Firefox

[http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/01/09/1544211/inside-north-koreas-naenara-browser](http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/01/09/1544211/inside-north-koreas-naenara-browser)

---

## HTTPS bent into the next super-cookies by researcher

- HSTS pin is set for each HTTPS-redirected site you use, its unique to user and site, and its readable from your browser settings by any site.

- Chrome, Firefox and Opera the issue is mitigated somewhat (IE doesnt support HSTS).

- HTTPS can be turned into a tracking feature that is, in the case of some browsers, ineradicable.

- Safari is the killer, though

- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), described in RFC 6797 (here), is a mechanism that helps sites redirect users from the insecure HTTP version to the encrypted HTTPS version

- HSTS created a mechanism for browsers to remember the HSTS policy of sites theyve visited.

## The unusual suspects: Ex-employees, Lizard Squad may have aided Sony hack

- their relays currently make up less than 1 percent of the Tor Network by capacity.

- Lizard Squad then apparently turned its attention to the Tor network

- creating a large number of Tor relays in an attempt to corner the network and demonstrate that they could de-anonymize traffic

- Tor team was working to remove the wave of new relays

## Tor de farce: NSA fails to decrypt anonymised network

- OTR (secure, but the software implementing it was found to be buggy and exploitable).

- Second-accurate packet logging of sessions between TOR clients and TOR guard nodes. This data could be obtained by SIGINT [signals intelligence] or by running guard nodes

- PGP (still secure)

- Second-accurate packet logging at TOR exit nodes we control with packets labelled by a unique circuit identifier.

- AES (under attack but no definitive proof that it was compromised by spooks)

- given packet times between the client and guard node and packet times from the exit node filtered to a single circuit.

- For this technique to work the following additional data feeds will be required:

- detail about A potential technique to deanonymise users of the TOR network

- GCHQ believed that they could unmask Tor

## FBI Says Search Warrants Not Needed To Use "Stingrays" In Public Places

- cases in which the technology is used in public places or other locations at which the FBI deems there is no reasonable expectation of privacy

## Canonical Launches Internet-of-Things Version of Ubuntu Core

- "With Snappy there is also a division of responsibilities for updating that can also help protect IoT devices and users.

## Winklevoss Twins Aim to Take Bitcoin Mainstream With a Regulated Exchange - NYTimes.com

- Many major Bitcoin companies, however, were founded by people with little previous financial experience. Bitcoins themselves are stored on a decentralized database

- Coinbase, a kind of retail brokerage firm, announced a $75 million financing round  the biggest ever for a Bitcoin start-up

## A dead mans switch for your computer?

- WATCHFILE="/path/to/file"

while true; do

- This got me thinking; why dont we have Dead Mans Switches for computers?

- The agents managed to steal the laptop out of Ulbrichts hands and therefore prevent him from locking the computer (which presumably had full-disk encryption).

## Subconscious Keys

- We present a defense against coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology

- Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern

- We use a carefully crafted computer game to plant a secret password in the participants brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password

- the participant cannot be coerced into revealing it since he or she has no conscious knowledge of it

## Silk Road trial closes: Its a hacker! Its a virus! Its ludicrous.

- A federal jury saw a final clash between prosecutors and lawyers for Ross Ulbricht on Tuesday as the Silk Road drug-trafficking trial sped to a close.

- suggested again that Ulbricht left the site behind but came back

- Ulbrichts own lawyer admitted during opening statements that his client created the site. Theres no dispute it was used to sell drugs, said Turner. Theres no dispute when the defendant was arrested, he was logged in as Dread Pirate Roberts.

- bookkeeping spreadsheets. The to-do lists. The weekly reports. The maintenance logs. The chatsmore than 1,000 pages of chats with Variety Jones, his hacker-mentor.

- Dread Pirate Roberts and Ulbricht cant be the same person, in part because Ulbricht just didnt have the sophistication and cunning that DPR exhibited, said Dratel.

- An entire copy of the Silk Road site was found, encrypted, on a thumb drive on Ulbrichts bedside table. Would Dread Pirate Roberts do that? he asked.

- Would DPR have saved his chats? Even Ulbrichts position in the library, with his back to the door, was a move Dread Pirate Roberts wouldnt have made, said Dratel.

- Keeping a journal like that? he asked. Does that sound like DPR? Its a little too convenient. Its like a virtuoso piano player who cant play Happy Birthday. It doesnt fit.

## Malicious Google Play apps (may have) hosed millions of Android handsets

- Security researchers have once again found Google Play offering malicious apps that have been downloaded by millions of Android users

- When you install Durak, it seems to be a completely normal and well working gaming app

- . After a week, you might start to feel there is something wrong with your device

- Each time you unlock your device an ad is presented to you, warning you about a problem, e.g. that your device is infected, out of date or full of porn

- You are then asked to take action, however, if you approve you get re-directed to harmful threats on fake pages, like dubious app stores and apps that attempt to send premium SMS behind your back or to apps that simply collect too much of your data for comfort while offering you no additional value.

- Update: About six hours after this post went live, a Google spokeswoman e-mailed to say the three apps have been pulled from Play.

## [ooni-dev] Timeline of Tor blocking

- Tor's site was blocked in Turkey in March 2014: http://cartography.io/

- "Iran  2013  TCP reset on all non-HTTP"

- a traffic shaping behavior that matched TCP connections
against a whitelist (HTTP or HTTPS)

- if the connection did not match this
behavior, then the throughput was throttled down to 1 packet per second
after sixty seconds

- Psiphon's bypass mechanism was to prepend "GET /
HTTP1.0" in front of traffic streams.
