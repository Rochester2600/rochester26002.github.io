## Is Web Crypto Really Doomed? I bet $100!

- Heres a simple Ephemeral Origins technique that can solve this problem step by step.   Appcache all the things and add /a.appcache file itself to the manifest.   Setup DNS record for wildcard subdomains.   Create a simple endpoint wallet.sakurity.com that redirects to wallet-zcyxgphpp57.sakurity.com where zcyxgphpp57 is randomly generated ephemeral origin.

- There will be no 3rd party scripts, everything is self hosted and appcached. 3) Browser extensions, cool timing attacks and other SOP bypasses?

- They compromise all your web pages and cookies anyway. In other words you still shouldnt chat about your ISIS recruitment over yet another in-browser end-2-end chat, or store thousands of Bitcoins in localStorage (even if I told you to), but for apps that alone are not more sensitive than all your web accounts hacked altogether (ToDo lists, password managers on steroids, MEGA-like uploaders or casual emails) ephemeral origins can be quite useful. Thats why web crypto is doable, and not doomed.

- If you find a way how to read localStorage of that origin afterwards, when the service goes malicious, I will pay you modest $100 in BTC :) The exploit must work in all modern browsers (do not use shady ServiceWorkers, they break web too much) Phishing doesnt count, the user remembers wallet-d0svb8pr2 and wont type credentials on looking-new origin.

- Email homakov@gmail.com UPDATE after giving it a second thought and discussion with @joernchen, I think number of threats is too high, even though silent attack is not possible, and no one should use it yet.

## How Is the NSA Breaking So Much Crypto?

- If a client and server are speaking Diffie-Hellman, they first need to agree on a large prime number with a particular form. There seemed to be no reason why everyone couldn't just use the same prime, and, in fact, many applications tend to use standardized or hard-coded primes. But there was a very important detail that got lost in translation between the mathematicians and the practitioners: an adversary can perform a single enormous computation to "crack" a particular prime, then easily break any individual connection that uses that prime.

## Sit down already: standing desks aren't healthier than seated ones

-   Now a large study undertaken by the University of Exeter and University College London and published in the International Journal of Epidemiology suggests that the problem isnt sitting, its not getting enough exercise, and that standing (which may be more comfortable for some people in any event) doesnt help  though treadmill desks and bike desks would presumably make some kind of difference.     Conclusions: Sitting time was not associated with all-cause mortality risk.

## University of Cambridge study finds 87% of Android devices are insecure

- After the participants opted into the survey, theUniversity says it collected dailyAndroid version and build number informationfrom over20,400 devices.

- Each individual device was then labeled secure or insecure based on whether or not its OS version was patched against these vulnerabilities or placed in a special maybe secure category if it could have gotten a specialized, backported fix. Further ReadingWaiting for Androids inevitable security ArmageddonEditorial: Androids update strategy doesnt scale, and thats recipe for disaster.

- The group states thatthe bottleneck for the delivery of updates in the Android ecosystem rests with the manufacturers, who fail to provide updates to fix critical vulnerabilities.Along with the study, theUniversity of Cambridge is launching AndroidVulnerabilities.org, a site that houses this data and grades OEMs based on their security record.The groupcame up with a 1-10 security rating for OEMs that it calls the FUM score.

- The other issue is probably that thistwo years of updates policythat Google and OEMs have been livingby doesnt match up with reality.

- According to IDC Research, the top fourAndroid OEMs worldwide are Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Lenovo, respectively.

## Shocker: Net anarchist builds sneaky 220v USB stick that fries laptops

- Vid An internet mischief maker has built a USB stick that delivers dangerous 220-volt shocks to PCs, destroying them in the process. The USB Killer is the second iteration of a laptop-wrecking device crafted by a Linux and infosec techie nicknamed Dark Purple.

- The first version of the PC-zapping hardware emerged in March, and pumped 110 volts of anarchic fun across motherboards.

- The main feature of the new version of the device is the doubled output voltage, which is 220 volts (strictly speaking, minus 220). The USB zapper looks like any conventional USB stick. The Russian tinkerer says it uses a voltage converter that charges capacitors to 220V when plugged into a machine, drawing the power needed to do this from its victim.

- Doing so with one of these high-voltage charging sticks will send sparks flying across the office, perhaps literally.

## SDR Tutorials From Michael Ossmann

-  If youre just getting into software-defined radio (SDR) but you find some of the math and/or terminology a bit of hurdle, you could absolutely do worse than to check out these SDR tutorials by [Michael Ossmann].

- While theyre aimed at people using his HackRF One tool (which we love), most of the tutorial videos are very generally applicable, and we realized that we hadnt mentioned them explicitly before.

- Shame on us! Ossmann focuses on SDR using the open-source GNURadio Companion GUI tool, which makes implementing a lot of cool SDR techniques as easy as dragging and dropping items into a flow diagram.

- Heck, watch these two even if youre not interested in radio. The newest entry, covering DSP filters includes a great hands-on introduction to finite impulse response (moving average) digital filters.

- We really like the practical, simulation-based approach presented in the video  its just perfect for a quick introduction. So if youre looking for a relatively painless way to get into SDR, grab yourself an RTL-SDR dongle, burn yourself a GNURadio Live DVD, and work through these videos.

## CISA data-sharing bill passes Senate with no privacy protections | ZDNet

- Another, which critics argue would make it more difficult to track threat-data sharing under freedom-of-information laws, was also struck down.    Sen.

- Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who sponsored the bill in 2014, said the amendments would undo the careful compromises we made on this bill.Sen.

- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a Republican presidential candidate, voted for the bill.Privacy and rights groups criticized the bills passing in the wake of the vote.In remarks, Mark Jaycox, legislative analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, called the bill fundamentally flawed due to its broad immunity clauses, vague definitions, and aggressive spying authorities.The passage of CISA reflects the misunderstanding many lawmakers have about technology and security.

- Facebook was accused of secretly lobbying on CISA, but denied advocating publicly or privately for the bill.

- In a letter published earlier this year, security experts including Jacob Appelbaum, Bruce Schneier, and Black Hat keynote speaker and lawyer Jennifer Granick, said that waiving privacy rights will not make security sharing better.If passed by the House, the president is not expected to veto the bill.This post has been updated.

## Intel x86 considered harmful (new paper)

- Intel ME

- But, as you can see in the linked article, I believed we could use VT-d to protect the host OS from the potentially malicious ME-based rootkits (which we demonstrated back then).

- So, a few weeks after I read that book, I started thinking about how we could potentially get around this troublesome ME technology. Technology that Intel decided to serve to us on every new processor.

- it's possible to come up with a reasonable solution that would require only minor hardware modifications

- wanted to write a short paper summarizing all the security (and trustworthiness) problems we face on x86

- You can get the PDF here

## Better, Smaller WiFi Throwies

- [Victor] has improved the WiFi Throwie.

- he ESP8266 was created, and the world now has a tiny WiFi-enabled computer thats the size of a postage stamp

- Yes, WiFi throwies already exist, but coin cells dont work with the ESP

- [Victor] had a better solution: tiny lithium batteries for quadcopters exist

- While not recommended unless you intend to retrieve your throwable web server, it is an interesting example of the latest and cheapest technology that made a throwable webserver possible; 10 years ago, both the ESP and a battery this small would have been unthinkable.

- PsExec is an utility developed by Sysinternals and then acquired by Microsoft that allows to control a Windows computer by using the command line and represents a light-weight alternative to telnet.

Examples: The following command launches an interactive command prompt on \\fabio: This command executes IpConfig on the remote system with the /all switch, and displays the resulting output locally: This command copies the program test.exe to the remote system and executes it interactively: Specify the full path to a program that is already installed on a remote system if its not on the systems path: Run Regedit interactively in the System account to view the contents of the SAM and SECURITY keys:: To run Internet Explorer as with limited-user privileges use this command: PsExec one liners Multiple commands on one line: opens a new shell, echo a b c and pause Multiple commands split over multiple lines: Multiple commands, lines, escapes: grants Everyone Modify access to a folder on the remote machine:    123456  psexec-e\\fabio cmd/c(^mkdirc:\localapp\Common^mkdirc:\localdata\Common^c:\temp\icacls.exec:\localapp\common/grant Everyone:^^(OI^^)^^(CI^^)^^(M^^)^c:\temp\icacls.exec:\localdata\common/grant Everyone:^^(OI^^)^^(CI^^)^^(M^^)^)   Single line FOR loop: remotely registering 32bit .OCX files in 64bit Windows 7s syswow64 folder for backwards compatibility with old app: Run commands after psexec communication terminates: Install something under a SYSTEM account (sample batch file):    12345678910  @echo off::Run from UNC share,will need SYSTEM Account access"%~dp0psexec.exe"-smsiexec/i"%~dp0The Raisers Edge.msi"TRANSFORMS="%~dp0raiser.mst"/q"%~dp0psexec.exe"-scmd/c("%~dp0owc11.exe"/quiet)"%~dp0psexec.exe"-scmd/c(^copy/y"%~dp0Patchpackage.msp"^%%temp^%%^copy/y"%~dp0BBPatch.exe"^%%temp^%%^pushd^%%temp^%%^msiexec/p^"^%%temp^%%\Patchpackage.msp^"/q^)   Remotely add a user with administrator rights with password xxxxx that never expires :    1234567  psexec-e\\%h%cmd/c(^net user h4xor/delete^net user h4xor xxxxx/add^net localgroup Administrators h4xor/add^net localgroup Users h4xor/delete^wmic useraccount where"Name like '%%h4xor%%'"SET PasswordExpires=FALSE^)   PsExec Pass The Hash PsExec is interesting because it will authenticate with either a plaintext password or a password hash.

- Often as penetration testers, we successfully gain access to a system through some exploit, use meterpreter to grab the passwords or other methods like fgdump, pwdump, or cachedump and then utilize rainbowtables to crack those hash values.

- One great method with psexec in metasploit is it allows you to enter the password itself, or you can simply just specify the hash values, no need to crack to gain access to the system.

- Since WMI and RPC services are often used for remote administration and administration tools, it is common to see these ports open and unfiltered on internal networks. Two tools that ship with Kali for executing code with WMI are impackets wmiexec and pth-wmis. Recently Dave Kennedy, CEO of TrustedSec released a tool in collaboration with Justin Elze (author of the pth-toolkit): SprayWMI SprayWMI which leverages wmis and Magic Unicorn to automatically sweep subnet ranges for 135 and automatically attempts to login with either a password or hashes and automatically generate powershell injection to give you access to your payloads instantly and without touching disk. With SprayWMI  it moves super quick, finishing a class C in around 4 seconds and automatically creates the injection code, the listener inside of Metasploit, and launches everything for you.

## Some notes for Android and Chromium developers about BoringSSL httpst.covdnelgiHeN

- We recently switched Google's two billion line repository over to , our fork of OpenSSL. This means that BoringSSL is now powering Chromium (on nearly all platforms), Android M and Google's production services.

- the majority of Google's products are sharing a single TLS stack and making changes no longer involves several days of work juggling patch files across multiple repositories.

- For Linux distributions that doesn't even make sense because we've removed too much for many applications to run unaltered and, without linker trickery, it's not possible to have both OpenSSL and BoringSSL in the same process because their symbols will collide

- Generally when people say forking they mean that they took a copy of the code and started landing patches independently of the original source. That's not what we did with BoringSSL

- Rather than start with a copy, I started with an empty directory and went through OpenSSL function-by-function, reformatting, cleaning up (sometimes discarding) and documenting each one

## Ever curious about global supply chain throughput Here is a graph tracking intermodal usage from inception. httpst.cokxbxgzQJyP

- The surge of both container traffic and throughput is linked with the growth of international trade in addition to the adoption of containerization as privileged vector for maritime shipping and inland transportation.

- Until 2008 the growth of container throughput behaved according to the standard technological diffusion (or product life cycle) curve, which is "S" shaped.

- From the first containerized commercial services in the late 1950s until the design of the first cellular containerships in the 1960s, the container was an unknown variable in global shipping.

- The emergence of new manufacturing clusters incited long distance (transatlantic and transpacific) pendulum container services.

- This can involve a number of factors such as limits to the exploitation of comparative advantages in manufacturing as well as the associated trade imbalances and higher energy prices.

## SHA-1 Freestart Collision

- We present in this article a freestart collision example for SHA-1, i.e., a collision for its internal compression function. This is the first practical break of the full SHA-1, reaching all 80 out of 80 steps, while only 10 days of computation on a 64 GPU cluster were necessary to perform the attack.

- Whats news is that our previous estimates may be too conservative.

## Project Zero: Windows Drivers are Truely Tricky

- I dont provide any guarantees that there are no more bugs left to find. Its worth noting that this vulnerability didnt have a direct impact on the security of the encrypted drive volumes at rest.

- XP shipped with Fast User-Switching and remote desktop support, which allowed multiple interactive users to be logged in the same machine at the same time.

- The Truecrypt driver exposes a number of different IOCTLs to a user-mode application to perform its various tasks such as mount and unmounting encrypted disk images and enumerating information.

- However, to bypass the check we can just find any other way of getting the API to fail, IsDriveLetterAvailable will return TRUE, and we can mount an arbitrary drive letter even if it already exists.

- By running in the system process context its not possible, at least without Administrator privileges, to influence the DosDevices location either via the per-user directory or the per-process directory. This might lead a developer, and even an auditor to think that IoCreateSymbolicLink does something special to guard against this attack.

## SYNful Knock is no Stuxnet, says researcher

- 

- Yet another set of shivers is running up spines at Cisco, with a researcher from Grid32 claiming that rooting the companys IOS firmware isnt as hard as people think. The issue of compromised firmware arose in August when the company first warned that its ROMMON firmware images could be replaced with a compromised version by a malicious admin.

- The vulnerability, since dubbed SYNful Knock, has since been spotted in the wild, with Cisco working hard to identify embaddened boxen. Its been widely assumed the only reason SYNful Knock and similar attacks arent widespread is the arcane nature of firmware hacking  and thats what Grid32s Luca Hall has decided needs wider discussion. In this paper (PDF), Hall says the idea that a firmware-based attack involves advanced knowledge or nation state level resource is a common misconception. While the 32-page paper isnt quite messing about with trivia, Hall reckons the work involved needs far, far less than such sophistication: a weeks worth of studying PowerPC assembly, a weeks worth of studying disassembly, and about a weeks worth of writing code and debugging time is sufficient, he claims, for anyone with the basics of assembly language under their belt to create a firmware-based rootkit. Binary modification to the firmware of a Cisco device running IOS merely involves basic coding skills, knowledge of assembly language for the target architecture, a base level knowledge of disassembly, combined with time and interest, Hall concludes.

## A close look at an operating botnet

- S+   16:30   0:00 grep --color=auto httpd  If you check the CPU usage of processes, however, /usr/sbin/httpd sticks out like a sore thumb because it polls the server socket with no timeout after it connects.

- Why don't I try logging into the botnet with a regular IRC client? I fired up another docker instance, Weechat, and a tor proxy.

- I suspect that the operaters were moving around the bots or were continually exploiting shellshock vulnerable machines like my honey pot. I wanted to see if I could send commands to the botnet since I had access to the channels, but after a couple hours of unfurling the perl script, I discovered that it authenticates commands based on the servername and nickname in the IRC message.

- No DOS attacks. Conclusion I didn't want my honey pot to be contributing to illegal activities, so I shut it down. It wasn't long before I couldn't log in to the IRC network on wileful.com. At first I thought I got locked out, but after scanning it from multiple different IP addresses I never used before, it was still unresponsive.

- I suspect that the botnet moved to another server or stopped accepting new connections. My setup for the honey pot and my results from this analysis can be found here.

## End-To-End Encryption

- One thing that is slightly easier to install than custom software is a browser plugin like Cipherbox. Still, Cipherbox provides for a quite simple attack vector: Once the message has been decrypted and inserted into the HTML document, a drive-by Javascript can steal the decrypted message and send it wherever you don't want it to be.

- The only solution to truly provide end-to-end encryption in that case is to have unencrypted data only appear in the custom user interface of the add-on, never in the web page

- Th

- In the case of secushare you of course get a lot more than just what a browser add-on could offer, since a web browser wouldn't be able to do onion routing or other of the magic described on this website to dramatically improve your privacy in communications.

- Secure Share provides for end-to-end encryption in its core daemon, avoiding any potential security leaks induced by the architecture of the World Wide Web. See the secushare.org homepage for details.

## SHA1 algorithm securing e-commerce and software could break by years end

- SHA1, one of the Internets most crucial cryptographic algorithms, is so weak to a newly refined attack that it may be broken by real-world hackers in the next three months, an international team of researchers warned Thursday. SHA1 has long been considered theoretically broken, and all major browsers had already planned to stop accepting SHA1-based signatures starting in January 2017.

- Now, researchers with Centrum Wiskunde  Informatica in the Netherlands, Inria in France, and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore have released a paper that argues real-world attacks that compromise the algorithm will be possible well before the cut-off date.

- The Flame espionage malware, which the US and Israel are reported to have unleashed to spy on sensitive Iranian networks, wielded such a collision attack to hijack Microsofts Windows Update mechanism so the malicious program could spread from computer to computer inside an infected network.

- The much lower cost is the result of efficiencies the researchers discovered in the way graphics cards can use a technique known as boomeranging to find SHA1 collisions.

- The proposal argued that some large organizations currently find it hard to move to a more secure hashing algorithm for their digital certificates and need the additional year to make the transition. The paper was written by Marc Stevens, Pierre Karpman, and Thomas Peyrin.

## Crypto cadre cloud-cracks SHA-1 with just US$75k of compute cost

- A crypto cadre has busted the SHA-1 security standard after using $US75,000 of cloud computing resources, handily undercutting conservative crypto cracking estimates and putting such an attack within reach of well-resourced groups. The work brings forward the beginnings of the death knell for the widely-used hash function by two years.

- It was estimated in 2012 that such attacks would cost $173,000 to pull off by 2017. The work paves the way for SHA-1 collision attacks and while impressive ought not to spark panic. Crypto mind Bruce Schneier says SHA-1 is known to be theoretically broken and the research merely adds weight to the argument that support for it among browser barons should not be extended. This is not that unexpected, Schneier says . All the major browsers are planning to stop accepting SHA-1 signatures by 2017 [and] Microsoft is retiring it on that same schedule. Whats news is that our previous estimates may be too conservative. Faster compute power, tweaked attacks, and new attack vectors all add up to circumstances in which it is hard to predict the end of life for crypto standards. The cracking work was performed by researchers Marc Stevens of the Dutch research institute Centrum Wiskunde and Informatica with Pierre Karpman and Thomas Peyrin from Singapores Nanyang Technological University. The trio describes their work in in the paper Freestart collision for full SHA-1 [PDF] and in a dedicated website bearing the tongue-in-cheek title The SHAppening. The team writes that the freestart collision targeting the SHA-1 internal compression function is the first practical break of the full SHA-1, reaching all 80 out of 80 steps. It took 10 days for the researchers Amazon-powered 64-GPU cluster, dubbed The Kraken, to pull off the attack.

- However, this work is an important milestone towards an actual SHA-1 collision and it further shows how graphics cards can be used very efficiently for these kind of attacks.

- We hope the industry has learned from the events surrounding the cryptanalytic breaks of MD5 and will retract SHA-1 before example signature forgeries appear in the near future.  The researchers call on the tech industry to reject a proposal to extend the issuance of SHA-1 certificates by a year due to alleged difficulties in switch over to SHA-3. The work, like most research, builds on the shoulders of others; the team credits its work as an extension of the recent freestart collision work on reduced-round SHA-1 from CRYPTO 2015 [PDF and EUROCRYPT 2013PDF.]

## It's BACK  Stagefright 2.0: Zillions of Android gadgets can be hijacked by MP3s, movie files

- Updated More than a billion Android phones, tablets and other gadgets can be hijacked by merely previewing MP3 music or MP4 video files. Booby-trapped songs and vids downloaded from the web or emails can potentially compromise vulnerable devices, and install spyware, password-stealing malware, and so on.

- This means criminals could well be studying the changes to cook up malware-laden MP3s to infect devices that cannot be patched, or get their patches late. The first, and most critical issue, was pushed to AOSP nearly immediately despite an embargo, Zimperium told Vulture South. Good guys and bad guys alike scour open source projects to find recently patched security issues  patching an open source software project without providing an update puts users at risk, if even only for a matter of weeks. Thanks to the fragmented state of Android  patches have to be slowly fed from Google to hardware manufacturers and out to people via mobile carriers  just half of all affected users, and possibly far fewer, stand any hope of receiving a fix. Without the patch, phones and other gadgets running Android can be potentially hijacked and wrecked by software nasties hidden in MP3 or MP4 files. Zimperium hacker Zuk Avraham said the 40 per cent of Android users on version 4.4, aka KitKat, may receive patches along with the 20 per cent running the version 5, aka Lollipop, since Google slung out patches in this way when it fixed the first first Stagefright hole (CVE-2015-1538) in July. While we have no specific information about what devices will receive fixes, we believe Android devices running Android KitKat 4.4 and later will receive updates, Avraham said. However, since Android 6 is due to release next week as well, its possible that only 5.0 and 6.0 devices will receive updates. Google was not immediately available for comment. That reasoning suggests a best-case scenario where 40 per cent of users running rather old Android phones are unpatched, and a worst case where somewhere around 70 or 80 per cent are unpatched, depending on uptake of Android 6. Dj vu Stagefright 2.0 vulnerabilities are triggered when specially crafted MP3 audio or MP4 video files are scanned by software within Android.

- These files can be downloaded from the web, or from phishing emails, and allow arbitrary code smuggled within the media to execute. The Zimperium guys have produced roof-of-concept exploit code, but will only share it with some customers. Google was notified of the flaws on 15 August.  The first Stagefright hole revealed in July demonstrated how remote code execution could be obtained in a similar way by sending a poisoned MMS.

-  Updated to add Google has been in touch to say the bugs will be patched in this months batch of security fixes for Android, due out this Monday.

## A billion Android phones are vulnerable to new Stagefright bugs

- EnlargeRon AmadeoTheres a new round of Stagefright vulnerabilities that allows attackers to execute malicious code on more than one billion phones running ancient as well as much more recent versions of Googles Android operating system. Stagefright 2.0, as its being dubbed by researchers from security firm Zimperium, is a set of two bugs that are triggered when processing specially designed MP3 audio or MP4 video files.

- Google still hasnt issued a CVE index number for this second bug. When combined, the flaws allow attackers to used booby-trapped audio or video files to execute malicious code on phones running Android 5.0 or later.

- In a blog post published Thursday, Zimperium researchers wrote: The vulnerability lies in the processing of metadata within the files, so merely previewing the song or video would trigger the issue.

- Zimperium researchers found an earlier round of vulnerabilities that also made it possible for attackers to remotely hijack Android phones.

- Members of Googles Project Zero security research team recently found that Androids address space layout randomization provided only minimal protection against Stagefright exploits.

## Gigabytes of user data from hack of Patreon donations site dumped online

- The fact that source code exists  is interesting [and] suggests much more than just a typical SQL injection attack and points to a broader compromise, he told Ars.

- Its use was one of the saving graces of the breach, since it meant crackers would have to devote vast amounts of time and resources to crack the hashes.

- Thats precisely what crackers did last month to bcrypt-hashed password data taken during the hack of the cheaters dating website Ashley Madison.

- Access to the source code may also expose the encryption key said to protect social security numbers and tax IDs.

- However, ZFS On Linux contributor Richard Yao has said they do plan on including it in their kernel for 16.04 LTS and the GPL vs. CDDL license worries aren't actually a problem.

## A glimpse inside CryptoWall 3.0

- Its interesting to note that the original payload is a .JPG file, which is a simple trick to hide itself.  We believe that this domain (22072014b.com) is owned by the bad guy and its also seems to use the fast flux DNS technique.

- After looking at multiples infected pages, we didnt notice a common vulnerabilities, except that the infected path always seems to be part of a WordPress plugin. However, two of the WordPress observed had a PHP backdoor installed, which is a PHP file that allows the attacker to have a web control panel:  With this malicious code, they can access and control multiple things on the servers.

- In fact, computers infected by a ransomware will try to encrypt network drives aggressively, which can be detected by looking at the number of transactions in a certain time frame. You can also block the execution of a program in the temporary directory of windows.

- This procedure will show you how to create GPOs to do that. You should however be prepared no matter what and have backups for your systems. Conclusion Given that all motherships servers seem to have the same configuration, they are probably deployed automatically from a template by the attacker.

- Moreover, the fact that we see new infected WordPress with CryptoWall 3.0 almost each week demonstrates the organization of the attacker, because this also implies that they must update the ransomware each time so that the malware has the right URLs to contact. This whole process is well structured, it evolves to avoid being detected and seems to have become the new trend for hackers to make money.

## Long distance jammer knocks drones from the sky

-   From Make:  In a press release from Battelle, the gun is stated to use radio control frequency disruption technologies to safely stop drones in the air, before they can pose a threat to military or civilian safety. A video accompanying the post describes that it operates on standard GPS and ISM radio bands, allowing for it to interference with commercial UAV signals.  Reportedly, the DroneDefender can hit objects up to 400 meters with an effective cone diameter of 30.

- Encased in a hardy plastic shell, yet still light enough to maneuver, this drone handles even the most complex tricks you throw at it with ease.

## Mobile carriers make $24B/year selling your secrets

-  The largest carriers in the world partner with companies like SAP to package up data on your movements, social graph and wake/sleep patterns and sell it to marketing firms. 

- But given that it is, Im doing everything I can to be ready to offer an explanation and an alternative to the surveillance business-model for the people wholl show up shell-shocked and furious when the leaks come.    The practices that carriers have gotten into, the sheer volume of data and the promiscuity with which theyre revealing their customers data creates enormous risk for their businesses, said Peter Eckersley, chief computer scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy watchdog.

- Mr. Eckersley and others suggest that anonymization techniques are faulty in many cases because even information associated with a hashed or encrypted identification code can be linked back to a home address and potentially reidentified by hackers.  Unlike other types of location tracking, such as beacon technologies that work only with mobile apps that people have agreed to let track them, many services employing telco data require no explicit opt-ins by consumers.

- Verizons privacy policy, for example, says that information collected on its customers may be aggregated or anonymized for business and marketing uses by us or by third parties.  Ultimately, for mobile operators, these relationships could reap substantial income from the data generated by subscribers who already account for their primary revenue streams.

- With instruction from experts in their fields and unlimited access to an enormous library of trainings, youll learn to build and launch amazing websites using open source platforms like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.

## Get ready to register your drones in the US  or else

- The US Department of Transportation (DoT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are drawing up rules requiring people to register their drones. The DoT and FAA said in a joint statement Monday that they will be forming a task force to write registration guidelines, with a deadline of November 20.

- The 25-30 person panel will include government officials and people from both manned and unmanned flying associations.

- The group will deliver recommended guidelines on how the FAA and DOT should require registration for unmanned drones. The aim of the registration requirement, the DoT says, is to make it easier for authorities to track down people who fly their drones above the FAA designated-altitudes, or get too close to airports and other restricted zones. Registration will help make sure that operators know the rules and remain accountable to the public for flying their unmanned aircraft responsibly, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta. When they dont fly safely, theyll know there will be consequences. Such incidents, the FAA said, have been on the rise in the last two years, as personal drones have become more powerful and affordable. Among the more high-profile incidents: an encounter earlier this year when a drone buzzed a passenger jet in Dallas and a 2014 close call at Heathrow Airport.

- Drone craft have also been spotted flying over restricted parts of New York City and have gotten themselves stuck atop billion-dollar sport stadiums. While the DoT did not say exactly which representatives will be chosen from the drone and pilot industries, the department did say that it had the backing of groups including the Air Line Pilots Association, the Academy of Model Aircraft, and the Consumer Electronics association. The DoT noted that the requirement for registration will not be all-inclusive.

- Toys and smaller drones that dont fly at a high enough altitude to interfere with other aircraft would be exempted from the registration rules.

## CIA boss uses AOL email  and I hacked it, claims stoner teen

- After apparently rifling through the inbox and pulling out records on intelligence agency staffers, plus Brennans own application for top-level security clearance, the teen started posting the sensitive information on Twitter and text-hosting websites. Said information included what appeared to be the names, dates of birth and social security numbers of national intelligence workers, and the contents of Brennans address book.

- The kid also found a letter from US senators asking the CIA to scrap its use of torture in interrogations, its claimed. We are aware of the reports that have surfaced on social media and have referred the matter to the appropriate authorities, a CIA spokesperson told The Register on Monday. The hacker told the New York Post that he was able to use publicly available information about Brennan to social engineer his way through AOLs password reset system. Allegedly, the high-schooler and a couple of pals got hold of Brennans cellphone number, worked out he was a Verizon customer, called Verizon pretending to be employees at the telco, requested the customers account information, and then called back with that data to get the email account password reset. The kid was able to access 40 emails with documents attached  including a 47-page security-clearance application for Brennans current role, its alleged.

- [The] problem with these older-generation guys is that they dont know anything about cybersecurity, and as you can see, it can be problematic, a source told the Post. Also posted on one of the hackers now-suspended Twitter accounts was Brennans telephone call logs from July 20 to October 12 with Avril Haines, the White Houses Deputy National Security Advisor. In addition to Haines, the hacker claims to have accessed the Comcast account of US Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson via social engineering.

- Lee told El Reg in an email. The teenager  whose main Twitter account phphax is still active  said the attack and disclosure was motivated by opposition to US foreign policy and support for Palestine.

- In the meantime, the high school tearaway may want to put on a pair of running shoes or get a good lawyer  we suspect the CIA and DHS will be knocking down his door sooner rather than later.

## Google publishes crypto mandate for Android 6.0

- Googles put the issue of mandatory Android encryption back on the table, publishing a compatibility document that mandates it (with caveats) in Android 6.0 Marshmallow.

- devices with enough memory and processor power encrypt both private and shared storage  the /data and /sdcard partitions.

- The problem then was that Android lacked the AES drivers to access on-chip encryption acceleration

- For device implementations supporting full-disk encryption and with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) crypto performance above 50MiB/sec, the full-disk encryption MUST be enabled by default at the time the user has completed the out-of-box setup experience (emphasis added).

- If the user doesnt set a lock-screen, the encryption will be secured with a default passcode, so that if you change your mind and create a lock-screen later, the data will already be encrypted and only the key will change.

## Bug-hunt turns up vuln in LibreSSL

- The memory leak provides a path for an attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack, and also permits triggering of the buffer overflow.

- The buffer overflow exists because of a change to OBJ_obj2txt() which can write a null terminator out of bounds, and the resulting crash might provide a path for remote code execution.

- As the code reviewers note, however, because its stack-based its probably not exploitable on OpenBSD x86, where it appears to always smash the stack canary.

## Rogue Silk Road Fed starts 6.5-year stretch for nicking Bitcoins

- A rogue US federal agent was jailed for 78 months on Monday after he stole Bitcoins during an investigation into the notorious Silk Road online black market.

- Carl Force, 46, of Baltimore, Maryland, a former US Drug Enforcement Administration agent, was supposed to act as a mole, selling bogus information on the investigation of Silk Road to the drug souks boss.

- But rather than give the money he made from selling this insider info to the US government, Force pocketed it for himself  all $50,000 of it.

- Judge Richard Seeborg, who described the extent of his betrayal of trust as breathtaking.

- Defense lawyers cited Forces mental health problems and alcoholism as grounds for partial mitigation during the sentencing hearing in San Francisco, Reuters reports.

- Shaun Bridges, 32, of Laurel, Maryland, a former Secret Service agent who was charged alongside Force back in March with stealing Bitcoins, made a deal with prosecutors in August. Bridges is due to be sentenced in December.

## Let's Encrypt announces browser integration

- 

- Lets Encrypt has announced that its received cross-signatures from IdenTrust. The free-certificates-for-all venture, set up by researchers, the EFF, and a bunch of supporting vendors, says the cross-signatures mean the major browsers can now receive Lets Encrypt certificates without throwing an error.

- The cross-signatures apply to the organisations Lets Encrypt Authority X1 and Lets Encrypt Authority X2 intermediate certificates. With browser support, visiting the Lets Encrypt demonstration at https://helloworld.letsencrypt.org/ no longer throws an untrusted error in Mozilla, IE, Safari, Chrome and the like. The next step will be getting Web server admins to configure their systems to serve the cross-signature certificate. Thats not a problem, the group says. Almost all server operators will choose to serve a chain including the intermediate certificate with Subject Lets Encrypt Intermediate X1 and Issuer DST Root CA X3, the group writes.

- The official Lets Encrypt software will make this configuration seamlessly. Lets Encrypt was set up by Mozilla, Cisco, IdenTrust, Akamai, researchers from the University of Michigan, the Internet Security Research Group and the Electronic Frontiers Foundation.

## How a criminal ring defeated the secure chip-and-PIN credit cards

- After her arrest, four more members of the fraud ring were identified and arrested. That number included the engineer who was able to put together the chip card hacking scheme that a group of French researchers call the most sophisticated smart card fraud encountered to date.

- 25 stolen cards, specialized equipment, and 5,000 (approximately $5,660) in cash was seized. Ultimately police said about 600,000 (or $680,000) was stolen as a result of the card fraud scheme, spanning 7,000 transactions using 40 cards.

- According to the paper, the fraudsters were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by programming a second hobbyist chip called a FUN card to accept any PIN entry, and soldering that chip onto the cards original chip. This increased the thickness of the chip from 0.4mm to 0.7mm, making insertion into a PoS somewhat uneasy but perfectly feasible, the researchers write.

## Tardy TalkTalk advertised for a new infosec officer 1 week ago

- Embattled telco TalkTalk, under fire for losing four million customers data to an apparent hack, was hiring an information security officer just seven days ago. Following TalkTalks announcement of the data breach, which it bizarrely attributed to a Distributed Denial of Service Attack directed at its website, the company made confessed that it had been storing its customers information in an unencrypted format.

- This may have been due to some personnel shortages at the telco, with an advertisement for an information security officer going up just seven days ago. The telecommunications company stated it was seeking a skilled and highly experienced Information Security Officer to assist with the on-going programme of work to define, promote, achieve and maintain compliance with TalkTalk Information Security Group Policies with a view to reducing the risk of information security compromise.   Earlier today TalkTalks chief executive, Dido Harding, apologised for the companys lax security practices.

- Concerns have been raised about the telcos website being non-compliant with PCI-DSS requirements, potentially leaving customers card data accessible to cybercriminals. TalkTalk is yet to confirm specifics regarding the attack.

- It has, however, begun emailing customers its official response:  TalkTalk have (finally) emailed customers pic.twitter.com/iZ6bZEdtRQ  James Ball (@jamesrbuk) October 23, 2015   The Register has created a timeline of TalkTalks contradictory comments following on from the initial announcement of a website outage.

## Talk Talk: Hackers may have nicked personal, banking info on 4 million Brits

- TalkTalk is in the process of telling its four million subscribers that it has fallen victim to a sustained cyberattack  and it is possible that personal information including bank details have been pilfered. The UK ISP took down its website yesterday, telling us this was not related to a broadband outage, and the site stayed down today.

- The biz kept schtum on the reasons why.

- Tonight, TalkTalk issued a statement confirming the Met Police Cyber Crime Unit has launched a criminal investigation following a significant and sustained cyberattack on our website. The ISP admitted that unfortunately there is a chance that some customer data including subscribers names, home addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, bank account info and credit card numbers have been accessed by hackers. TalkTalk CEO Dido Harding said the company constantly updates its systems to protect against the rapidly evolving threat of cyber crime. Her company, the cops, and cyber-crime specialists are trying to discover how the hack happened, and the extent of the intrusion. Harding added: As a precaution, we are contacting all our customers straight away with information, support ad advice around yesterdays attack. This is not the first security scare to hit TalkTalk this year: in February, it revealed scammers purporting to be from the ISP had convinced customers to part with their bank account details.

## Patch Cisco ASA ASAP: DNS, DHCPv6, UDP packets will crash them

- Cisco has issued a firmware update to address four security flaws in its Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) that open up the gear to denial-of-service attacks. By exploiting these bugs, six models in the ASA family can be forced to repeatedly reset, rendering the hardware useless.

- Vulnerable products include the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls, Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv), and the Cisco Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module. The four issues, each with their own CVE listing, are as follows: CVE-2015-6324, a vulnerability present in devices equipped with the DHCPv6 relay feature allowing an attacker to reset the device with a specially-crafted DHCPv6 packet.

- CVE-2015-6326, a denial of service vulnerability related to improper handling of DNS packets.

- CVE-2015-6327, a flaw in the ASA Internet Key Exchange allowing an attacker to send a crafted UDP packet to force a restart on the targeted appliance. Cisco says network administrators should review the advisories and install the patches as soon as possible.

## This 11-year-old is selling cryptographically secure passwords for $2 each

- Earlier this month, Mira Modi, 11, began asmall business at dicewarepasswords.com, where she generates six-word Dicewarepassphrases by hand.

- It involves rollingactual six-sided dice as a way to generatetruly random numbers that are matchedto a long list of English words.

- Those words are then combined into a non-sensical string (ample banal bias delta gist latex) that exhibits true randomness and is therefore difficult to crack.

- If you just make one up, she told us, its not going to be a very good one. Remember what Edward Snowden said in his initial e-mail to Laura Poitras: Please confirm that no one has ever had a copy of your private key and that it uses a strong passphrase.

- Even if you dont understand how to use logarithms to calculate how many bits of entropy your passphrase is, you can tell that each word you add to your passphrase, out of a stack of paper worth of words, makes it exponentially less guessable, but its still not very hard to memorize. And what does the creator of Diceware himself make of all of this? I am tickled to hear this, and no, I havent heard of anything like it before, Arnold Reinold told Ars. Obviously from a security perspective it is much better to generate your own Diceware passphrase in private, but it is unlikely she is working for the bad guys, and any effort to publicize the importance of strong passwords is for the good, he continued.

## TalkTalk attack: 'No legal obligation to encrypt customer bank details', says chief

- TalkTalk continued on its quest to be painted merely as a victim of crime today, while the budget ISPs website remained offline following a huge attack on its business earlier this week. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Harding said that her company was under no legal obligation to encrypt sensitive customer data, such as bank account details.

- We have complied with all of our legal obligations in terms of storing of financial information. She added: The bad stuff that can happen is actually because the criminal then scams you further. TalkTalk has claimed that the data nicked by malefactors was materially lower than feared.

- However, the company was yet to reveal exactly how many of its customers were at risk of being targeted by scammers following the raid on its website. On Saturday, TalkTalk attempted damage limitation by saying that the attack was less serious than first thought.

- But the company did reveal that some credit card information had been snatched. Meanwhile, it has been claimed by security blogger Brian Krebs that the uncorroborated ransom message received by TalkTalk CEO Dido Harding included a demand for $80,000 in Bitcoin. Krebs wrote:  A source close to the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity told KrebsOnSecurity that the hacker group who demanded the 80,000 ransom provided TalkTalk with copies of the tables from its user database as evidence of the breach.

- BAEs cyber-specialists are currently analysing vast quantities of data to help establish how the breach happened and what information was stolen, we were told. The spokesbeing added: Hoping to get the site up and running as quickly as possible, but obviously we will not do so until we are confident that all aspects are as secure as possible.

        you can't increase the speed of light.

- (3)  With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is
        not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they
        are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them
        as they fly overhead.

- (4)  Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor
        understood unless experienced firsthand. Some things in
        networking can never be fully understood by someone who neither
        builds commercial networking equipment nor runs an operational
        network.

- (5)  It is always possible to aglutenate multiple separate problems
        into a single complex interdependent solution. In most cases
        this is a bad idea.

- (11) Every old idea will be proposed again with a different name and

## How a group of neighbors created their own Internet service

- Outages lasting a day or two were also common, Sutton said. Faced with a local ISP thatcouldnt providemodern broadband, Orcas Island residents designed their own network and built it themselves.

- All the connections need line-of-sight, especially for 5.8GHz, since thehigher frequencies are more easily blocked, Sutton said. There are now about 200 radios spread throughout the coverage area, and each homeowner who pays for service has a Wi-Fi router in the home to access the Internet.

- Often times its people watching Netflix and then falling asleep and then it keep auto-playing things all night long. In practice, customers get the speed they needat peak usage times, total bandwidth usage across the entire network is 30Mbps or so, well within the 70Mbps available. Its really those teenagers that consume all the bandwidth, Sutton said, describing his two kids in the living room, and both of them are on their screens watching YouTube with a big smile on their face. The microwave connection to the mainland is strong enough to handle more subscribers, but adding homes to the network requires bolstering capacity in specific areas, Sutton explained.No waiting around for corporate America Capacity can be boosted by adding radiosor with some tree trimming.

- Inthe past 18 months, he has literally driven every back road, climbed countless tall trees and run hundreds of sight lines, Brems said on his friends behalf.He has unpacked, inventoried, programmed, and installed dozens of pieces of equipment.

- The only Internet that continued to work was the school, library, and the DBIUA, all of which were using StarTouch microwave for their backhaul.I did a little bit of gloating for sure. With all the success, people in other parts of Orcas have since asked Suttonto set up networks for them.

## Novena: A Laptop With No Secrets

- Owners of small factories in China turned out to be eager to learn our agile approach to engineering, so they, too, could take on the challenge of low-volume production and address the growing market of hardware startups.    We started by considering the constraints of the most complex and brittle pieces of any such system: the software.

- Also, the two-step decoupling process can be used to create subtle cues, such as transparency and blur, where foreground windows and title bars can take on the character of frosted glass, providing a hint of what content might lie underneath them.  Unfortunately, the integrated GPU on the Freescale i.MX6 chip is closed source.

- We linked subsystems using generic connectors with pin-outs that were merely educated guesses as to what users would end up hooking onto those pins.  As a result, the final incarnation of the laptop includes specialized adapter boards for the battery pack, LCD, and front-bezel arrangement (the frame for the display).

- The warm reception it got on social media led us to attempt a crowdfunding campaign via Crowd Supply, a site that takes the idea of Kickstarter and turbocharges it with a Web store and logistics services.  One thing we learned in that brush with the mainstream consumer was that most people were not prepared for the experience we were delivering.

- You need an oil-cooled block weighing about a ton, capable of handling pressures found at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, machined internally to a tolerance less than the width of a human hair, with a moving clockwork of dozens of ejector pins, sliders, lifters, and parting surfaces separating and coming back together again smoothly over thousands of cycles.

## Mimic, the Evil Script That Will Drive Programmers To Insanity

- Mimic implements a devilishly sick idea floated on Twitter by Peter Ritchie: "Replace a semicolon (;) with a Greek question mark (;) in your friend's C# code and watch them pull their hair out over the syntax error." There are quite a few characters in the Unicode character set that look, to some extent or another, like others  homoglyphs. Mimic substitutes common ASCII characters for obscure homoglyphs. Caution: using this script may get you fired and/or beaten to a pulp.

## Think your mobile calls and texts are private? It ain't necessarily so

- Flaws in SS7 have been known about for years and readily lend themselves to surveillance, both targeted and on a grand scale, allowing miscreants to tap into calls, read text messages and divert traffic. In one well documented case, SS7 flaws were used to redirect sensitive conversations of targeted individuals on the MTS Ukraine network to a Russian mobile operator. By contrast, SS7 is far more robust when it comes to the security and integrity of billing functionality.

- El Regs story on the CCC presentation provides more info on how the ageing SS7 protocol works as well potential attacks. AdaptiveMobiles SS7 Protection service, launched in February 2015, aims to analyse and secure the SS7 traffic travelling through operator networks.

- Without appropriate preventative measures being put into place, operators are allowing adversaries to know exactly where a subscriber is at any given moment and to intercept and reroute device communications, listening to every call and reading every text message, the firm warns. Through our analysis of SS7 traffic weve detected numerous types of SS7 requests and responses being received and sent from one operator network to another, said Cathal McDaid, head of AdaptiveMobiles Threat Intelligence Unit.

- Were working with operators to secure their networks as none are exempt from these types of attacks. Chris Wysopal, CISO and CTO at application security firm Veracode, commented: The SS7 vulnerabilities are just another example of software-based systems that werent built for the rich interconnectivity and threats of the modern mobile infrastructure. Development teams need to go into projects with the expectations that what theyre creating will live in a hostile environment where attackers will look to exploit vulnerabilities.

- Weve seen this across every industry and its no surprise its occurring in the telco industry, he added. The potential for abuse for any group capable of breaking SS7 are rich, according to Wysopal. A core protocol like SS7 provides governments and rogue actors wide access to the worlds communications infrastructure making it an incredibly attractive system to break into, Wysopal explained.

## Further confusion at TalkTalk claims it was hit by 'sequential attack'

- TalkTalk is continuing to confuse experts with its latest assessment of the root cause of a high profile breach on its systems last week, which may have exposed the bank details including bank information of up to four million customers.

- The under-fire telco is saying that it has become the victim of a sequential attack when in reality it is talking about a SQL injection attack and not a follow-up assault.

- stating that the customers data may have been compromised via a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack which had targeted the companys website.

- Getting confused between sequential attack and a SQL injection attack is an easy enough mistake to make for a firm outside the technology sector. But TalkTalk is a telco so customers are entitled to expect it to have a clearer grasp of standard infosec practices. Coupled with the confusion over the consequences of what a DDoS attack might mean last week, it doesnt exactly inspire confidence.

## So what's the internet community doing about the NSA cracking VPN, HTTPS encryption?

- Now that the cat is firmly out the bag, and its clear that the NSA has cracked the encryption behind, potentially, a huge amount of internet traffic, the question inevitably turns to: what are internet engineers going to do about it?

- The posts title references a crucial element at the heart of the security flap: the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol.

- So now the IETF plans to kill off all support for 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman keys by updating RFC 4307, urging in the strongest terms developers and engineers to use at least 2048-bit key sizes.

- Meanwhile, a new RFC  RFC 7525  provides the best practice for improving the security of TLS/SSL by recommending specific, stronger cipher suites with at least 2048-bit keys.

- Its been just under two years that the IETF created RFC 7258 in response to the Edward Snowden revelations of mass online surveillance. Its been one year since the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) called for everything to be encrypted.

## Breaking 512-bit RSA with Amazon EC2 is a cinch. So why all the weak keys?

- The cost and time required to break 512-bit RSA encryption keys has plummeted to an all-time low of just $75 and four hours using a recently published recipe that even computing novices can follow

- But despite the ease and low cost, reliance on the weak keys to secure e-mails, secure-shell transactions, and other sensitive communications remains alarmingly high.

- The technique, which uses Amazons EC2 cloud computing service

- hanks to the edicts of Moores Lawwhich holds that computing power doubles every 18 months or sothe factorization attack required just seven hours and $100 in March, when FREAK, a then newly disclosed attack on HTTPS-protected websites with 512-bit keys, came to light.

## TalkTalk attack: Small biz customers may also have been targeted

- TalkTalk has confirmed that its business customers may also have been affected by the attack on its systems last week. The company is in the process of telling its biz subscribers that they may have had their data stolen following the latest security breach to have hit TalkTalk.

- A spokesman at the budget ISP told El Reg on Monday afternoon: We have emailed some of our business customers to warn them they may have been affected, and we should be able to update our business customers in the next day or two. TalkTalk was initially tight-lipped on the fate of its biz customers when quizzed by us. However, the company eventually admitted that its Business wing may have been affected after the Reg challenged why it was that TalkTalk couldnt answer our question so many days after the attack had taken place. A webpage buried on the TalkTalk Business site has confirmed that past and present SMB customers who carried out transactions with the ISP online are affected by the breach. The telco said that small businesses may have had their name, address, email address, telephone number, TalkTalk account information, password and bank details nicked by malefactors. Since late last week, the telco has been working with data-mining specialists at BAE Systems, who were called in to help TalkTalk ensure that its systems are secure. Meanwhile, the company claimed over the weekend that its core systems hadnt be breached during the attack.

- Nonetheless, some credit card details were lifted by thieves, TalkTalk has said. But its unclear how TalkTalk Business customers have been caught up in the drama, given that the division has a separate website to the ISPs front-of-shop consumer site. Weve asked the question and are awaiting a response. TalkTalk Business has roughly 180,000 biz and public sector customers on its books and it works with 350 wholesale partners nationwide.

- Get in touch in confidence by clicking on the byline link above this story.   The Register has created a timeline of TalkTalks contradictory comments following on from the initial announcement of a website outage.

## US Senate approves CISA cyber-spy-law, axes privacy safeguards

- This legislation gives the government and US companies new voluntary collaborative tools so that they can work together against hackers that have been all too successful at stealing the personal information of millions of Americans for years. The bill encourages tech giants and other companies to disregard existing privacy agreements and share citizens personal information with the federal government in exchange for immunity from prosecution by angry customers. This will allow agents to pick out signs of criminality from the volunteered data, and use it to catch online crooks.

- These included requiring the US Department of Homeland Security to scrub more personal information before forwarding data to other agencies, and to remove the provision that makes sharing peoples records under CISA immune from freedom of information requests. The fight to secure Americans private, personal data has just begun, said Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), who voted against the legislation and tried for an amendment to increase the privacy protections in CISA. As even the sponsors have acknowledged, this bill will do little to protect Americans from sophisticated hacks.

- At the same time, it will allow large volumes of Americans personal data to be unnecessarily shared with government agencies from the NSA to the FBI. Some amendments did pass, however.

- A cosponsor of the bill, Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) inserted an amendment to extend the life of the legislation from six years to 10, and an amendment last week allows federal agencies that need the data in a hurry to get it without personal information being stripped out. In other words, the law will now stand for a decade (unless repealed), and the Feds can demand raw sensitive information immediately, or anonymized information if they are not pushed for time. The House of Representatives passed legislation similar to CISA earlier in the year and the bill will now go into a committee stage while the differences between the two are ironed out.

- Id guess the White House has realized it may have to do something on security, even if it is a horrible cybersecurity bill.   Psst: If youre not an American citizen, none of this applies to you  the US government and its intelligence agents consider you completely fair game for surveillance, anyway.

## Feds in America very excited about new global privacy alert system

- US watchdog the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has signed an agreement with seven countries to share cross-border information relating to privacy. The new alert system will let regulators from America, UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Norway share confidential information about ongoing investigations, and the FTC is very excited about it.

- Today, data is increasingly crossing borders, and our privacy investigations and enforcement must do the same, said FTC chair Edith Ramirez at the signing on Sunday.

- And the GPEN website has yet to update itself to contain information about its own new alert system. Those displaying indifference include the host country of the 37th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners where the agreement was signed, and the country that is the focus of global privacy issue at the moment  Ireland  thanks to the recent victory of Max Schrems against Facebook in the European Court of Justice (Schrems sued Facebook in its European headquarters in Ireland). The news follows comments from the FTCs bureau director Jessica Rich last week who criticized EU data protection authorities for not having done enough to beat violations of the now-defunct Safe Harbor framework, and a speech from FTC Commissioner Julie Brill in which she pointedly noted that Europe was not having an honest discussion about data privacy and sharing. During the entire time we were enforcing the Safe Harbor, we had gotten only four referrals, Rich told reporters last week.

- The referral process was not working and at a certain point, we decided to start looking for Safe Harbor violations ourselves. Its not clear at that stage whether the GPEN Alert system  which is based on the FTCs own Consumer Sentinel Network  will suffer a similar lack of interest. Happy campers It is no secret that data protection offices from around the world, but especially in Europe, are not happy about the US approach to privacy, particularly when it comes to the commercial use of customers data. Many have been actively lobbying to have the Safe Harbor framework shut down for a number of years, but were consistently ignored by politicians in the European Commission.

- The FTC was responsible for overseeing a framework that was largely one-sided: American companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google pulling personal details of Europeans over to State-side servers. The ECJ judgment turned that situation on its head and has left US companies and authorities scrambling to find an alternative. Meanwhile, Europe has provided 13 recommendations for the United States but the US government has so far refused to budge, citing national security issues.

## Low-cost IMSI catcher for 4G/LTE networks tracks phones precise locations

- Researchers have devised a low-cost way to discover the precise location of smartphones using the latest LTE standard for mobile networks, a feat that shatters widely held perceptions that the standard is immune to the types of attacks that targeted earlier specifications.

- The attacks target the LTE specification, which is expected to have a user base of about 1.37 billion people by the end of the year, and require about $1,400 worth of hardware that run freely available open source software

- Passive aggression versus evolved NodeB

- The researchers behind the LTE attack found that similar paging requests can be triggered by social messaging apps such as those provided by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Viber, with little to no indication to the owner that any tracking is taking place.

## Iranian VXers unleash RATs to bite popular Android devices

- 

- Future threat researcher Rodrigo Bijou says Iranian hackers have made Android a priority for attacks with remote access trojans. The San Francisco consultant says attackers are preferring AndroRAT and DroidJack over common trojans like njRAT and DarkComet.

- Android is the most popular mobile OS in the Middle East and Africa, where it runs on more than 80 percent of devices according to number crunchers at IDC. Bijou (@rodrigobijou) says he learned of the attack trend after assessing six months worth of chatter on underground crime forums. Looking at the last six months of activity on prominent Iranian hacking forums, discussions are dominated by interest in RATs that target Android devices, Bijou says. The sustained Iranian interest in [the older] AndroRAT, despite its age and declining chatter from other sources, could be due to the easy download access, including GitHub repositories, and available community support for deploying the malware. The two RATs in particular, AndroRAT and DroidJack, are likely popular among hacking forum members due to the same reasons as njRAT  open access to download or purchase, strong community support, and ease of use. DroidJack is reckoned to be the handiwork of several developers based in Chennai, India. Bijou says the malware sports dozens of features, including interception of SMS, contacts, call logs, and browser histories along with credential-snatching. Both remote access trojans can be woven into legitimate-looking apps to trick victims into installing it. The popularity of the malware stands in contrast to other crimeware favoured on other underground sites. Bijou reckons malware targeting Android in the region will only increase.

## Shocker: Adobe patches critical Shockwave remote hijack hole

- 

- Adobe has patched a critical vulnerability in the Shockwave player that could compromise hundreds of millions of machines. The company brags that some 450 million users run the vulnerable platform and should manually update through the Adobe website.

- The memory corruption hole (CVE-2015-7649) allows attackers to compromise Windows and Mac boxes and gain remote code execution. Adobe says Fortinet reported the hole, which is rated critical. This update addresses a critical vulnerability that could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system, says. Those running the latest version 12.2.0.162 and earlier will need to upgrade to 12.2.1.171. The new bug comes after Adobe released a monthly batch of security updates and an emergency critical patch for Flash. Those holes caused remote-code execution, information disclosure, and crashes across most browsers, platforms, and devices.

## Landmark for Hidden Services: .onion names reserved by the IETF

- We think that this is a small and important landmark in the movement to build privacy into the structure of the Internet.

- This standardization work for .onion is joint work between Facebook and the Tor Project amongst others in an effort to help secure users everywhere. Over the last few years, The Tor Project has been working with other members of the Peer to Peer community led by Dr. Christian Grothoff, founder of the GNUnet project to register several Special-Use Domain Names.

- In this draft we listed security and privacy considerations that we believe will help to protect end users from targeted and mass-surveillance.

- We hope that in the future we'll see easy to issue certificates from the Let's Encrypt project for .onion services.

- We'd also like to thank everyone who helped with this process including but not limited to Mark Nottingham, Roger Dingledine, Linus Nordberg, Seth David Schoen, Leif Ryge, Helekin Wolf, Matthias Wachs and Dr. Christian Grothoff.

## Tor Messenger Beta: Chat over Tor, Easily

- It supports a wide variety of transport networks, including Jabber (XMPP), IRC, Google Talk, Facebook Chat, Twitter, Yahoo, and others; enables Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging automatically; and has an easy-to-use graphical user interface localized into multiple languages. What it isn't... Tor Messenger builds on the networks you are familiar with, so that you can continue communicating in a way your contacts are willing and able to do.

- The main feature it lacked was OTR support, which we have implemented and hope to upstream to the main Instantbird repository for the benefit of all Instantbird (and Thunderbird) users. Current Status Today we are releasing a beta version with which we hope to gain both usability and security related feedback.

- There have been three previous alpha releases to the mailing lists that have already helped smooth out some of the rougher edges. Downloads (Updated) Linux (32-bit) Linux (64-bit) Windows (UPDATED) sha256sums.txt sha256sums.txt.asc The sha256sums.txt file containing hashes of the bundles is signed with the key 0x6887935AB297B391 (fingerprint: 3A0B 3D84 3708 9613 6B84  5E82 6887 935A B297 B391). Instructions   On Linux, extract the bundle(s) and then run: ./start-tor-messenger.desktop  On OS X, copy the Tor Messenger application from the disk image to your local disk before running it. On all platforms, Tor Messenger sets the profile folder for Firefox/Instantbird to the installation directory.  Note that as a policy, unencrypted one-to-one conversations are not allowed and your messages will not be transmitted if the person you are talking with does not have an OTR-enabled client.

- The Windows and OS X builds are not completely reproducible yet but we are working on it. What's to Come Our current focus is security, robustness and user experience.

- As always, we are idling on IRC in #tor-dev (OFTC) (nicks: arlolra; boklm; sukhe) and subscribed to the tor-talk/dev mailing lists. Please note that this release is for users who would like to help us with testing the product but at the same time who also understand the risks involved in using beta software. Thanks and we hope you enjoy Tor Messenger! Update: For Windows 10 (and some Windows 7, 8) users who were experiencing an issue in Tor Messenger where it wouldn't start, we have updated the download links above with a newer version that fixes the problem described in bug 17453.

## 000webhost data breach ~13M passwords disclosed

- The contents of these breaches has potential to do harm to both the organisation which lost the data and the individuals within there so I give great thought to what the responsible approach is in each case. Every now and then, I get someone contacting me like this:  Hey, approximately 5 months ago, a certain hacker hacked into 000webhost and dumped a 13 million database consisted of name, last name, email and plaintext password Now this puts me in an awkward position.

- The chances of this happening by coincidence are extremely low and the only other explanation that can sometimes come up is that an attacker has used an enumeration risk to build up a list of email addresses on the site then faked the other data (i.e.

- It would have been possible to emphatically confirm if the data was legit by actually trying to login with the plain text password, but that wasnt going to happen as a matter of principle. This was enough for me  I had to notify 000webhost so that they could advise their customers and obviously fix the underlying risk as well.

- I'm trying to validate something and will share more with you if it's what I'm after. I get some feedback but I also follow up the next morning:  Still looking for some 000webhost users to help me out with something, ping me if you have an account. Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) October 26, 2015 I get a bunch of replies with email addresses that are in the breach and I provide them with their data.

- I hope this has given you some insight as to how many organisations still handle your data, how it is compromised, traded and monetised and just how hard it can be to actually get through to organisations in the wake of an incident like this. Ill leave you with a comment from Oliver, a fellow developer and one of the people that contacted me and verified their data from the breach:  Looking at the site, it appears like the creation of one individual or a very small team with little experience building sites at such scale; in today's day and age, security on the web simply isn't taken seriously enough. Hard to argue with that. There are now 13,545,468 000webhost email addresses searchable in HIBP. Update: Also see Toms story about the breach on Forbes. Update: Finally, 000webhost has notified some customers of the breach (many accounts in the data set have not received a notification): Almost 8 days after they were first notified, here we are: https://t.co/fRvrkvabfl Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) October 30, 2015 Update: I've been inundated by requests from people who want me to check which password they were using or who want a copy of the breach.

## Dotcom is building a private internet

- Kim Dotcom is building his own private internet, allegedly safe from the prying eyes of surveillance authorities.MegaNet will rely on peoples unused processing power on their phones and laptops, and allow them to donate bandwidth to the service.The more people that install the MegaNet app on their devices, the more powerful it will become, Dotcom said via video link at Sydneys SydStart conference last week.If 100 million smartphones joined up, the network would have more online storage capacity, bandwidth and calculating power than the top 10 largest websites in the world combined, he said.It will rely on existing physical internetinfrastructure people use today  so-called dumb pipes  but will add a new layer of encryption running through all communications.Dotcom claimed the encryption technology hell use is so powerfulno

- super computer will be able to crack it.The web mogul explained that MegaNet will work on a non-IP-based internet that uses the beauty of blockchain[Bitcoins public ledger]and new protocols to communicate and exchange data, while still using the internetsexisting physical infrastructure.If you dont have IP addresses you cant hack the server, you cant execute denial of service attacks on gaming services or websites, Dotcom saidfrom New Zealand,where he is currently awaiting the result of anextradition trial.Most importantly it will make it difficult for governments to invade our privacy.

- This entire network Im working on is fully encrypted.It literally works from the people for the people.In order to function, MegaNet is literally going to be using up your devicesbattery power, storage capacityand webbandwidth to power its so-called private network.  Ad Feedback 

- Its not costing them anything.As for theblockchain, MegaNetwill borrow from Bitcoins lauded method of recording transactions, butinstead of users storing transaction records, they willstore some of the files that make up this new alternative private internet.Presumably thesewill be encrypted too, otherwise everyone who connects to MegaNet will have some record of who is using the system and for what purpose, and that would contradictDotcoms pitch.The millionaire admitted that phone technology, includingbattery life, will need to improve before MegaNet can really take off.Were looking at a 10-year plan, he said.Over the next decade, current smartphones are going to be replaced by phones 10 times stronger and faster, with massively more computing power, that are as powerful as desktop computers are today.Battery tech in the making is going to give you 24 to 48 hours battery time with full usage.

- Todays bottlenecks might be a challenge, but over the years, with new devices and new capacity with mobile bandwidth, there will be no limitations.The mogul is confident that a technology solution will keep people secure and that privacy doesnt require newinfrastructure.Right now theyre just my words, but Ill prove it to you with proof when the service goes live.

## What Do WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, Jenkins, OpenNMS, and Your Application Have in Common? This Vulnerability.

- Depending on the language, this can lead to all sorts of consequences, but most interesting, and the one we will talk about here is remote code execution. Previous Work There have been a few Java unserialize vulnerabilities published in the past few years.

- The project started off promising, with such a large code base and so much exposed, there had to be something vulnerable. After some time searching we eventually got it into our heads that it would be amazing if we could find an unserialize vulnerability in Java or a common library.

- Remote code execution in many many things including custom applications Checkbox Checkers  Uncheck the boxes, youre probably not compliant anymore (and lets be honest, you probably never were)  How do you fix it?

- Then buckle up, this section in combination with the examples should give you enough to develop a working exploit. What Am I Looking For? The first thing you need to do is find a part of the application that takes a serialized object as input.

- I could lie to you and say this took me 15m to figure out, but it actually took a few hours. First Attempt Looking at the screenshot of the hex dump above, the first packet is pretty easy to replicate, we can just copy the bytes right out of Wireshark and paste them into a Python script, no problem.

## SHA-1 Deprecation Update

- In a previous update on TechNet, we announced that Windows will block SHA-1 signed TLS certificates starting on January 1, 2017.

- In light of recent advances in attacks on the SHA-1 algorithm, we are now considering an accelerated timeline to deprecate SHA-1 signed TLS certificates as early as June 2016. Mozilla recently announced a similar intent on the Mozilla Security Blog.

- We will continue to coordinate with other browser vendors to evaluate the impact of this timeline based on telemetry and current projections for feasibility of SHA-1 collisions. For more details on our schedule, please see Windows Enforcement of Authenticode Code Signing and Timestamping on Technet, or reach out to us on Twitter or in the comments below.  Kyle Pflug, Program Manager, Microsoft Edge

## Big mistake, Google. Big mistake: Chrome OS to be 'folded into Android'

- The software will be demonstrated by the end of 2016, and released the next year, the WSJ claims. Chrome OS was pitched as an operating system for low-powered netbooks, and is largely aimed at the education market.

- It is built from the open-source Chromium OS, a minimal Gentoo-derived GNU/Linux operating system that pretty much does everything through the Chrome (or Chromium) web browser. Although it can run a handful of native apps offline, its mostly a terminal to the web: word processing, games, social nattering, and so on, can all be done online through the browser. The integration of Chrome OS into Android is not unexpected: a merging of the two operating systems has been on the cards since 2013, when Google Android exec Andy Rubin was replaced by Chrome OS veteran Sundar Pichai.

- A year later, Google showed off technology allowing Android apps to run on Chrome OS systems, and today Pichai is Googles chief exec. The reported move is not without its critics, particularly in the security community.

- If development of Chrome OS stalls while Googlers focus on building a laptop-friendly Android, thats what you might call bad news.  Most experts I know have deep respect for the security in Googles Chrome OS.

- Plz dont go away =(  SecuriTay (@SwiftOnSecurity) October 29, 2015 Judging by this paragraph in the WSJs article, the open-source Chromium project will quietly soldier on while Google staff beaver away on a Chromedroid hybrid: Chrome OS will remain as an open source operating system that other companies can use to make laptops, and Google engineers will continue maintaining it.
