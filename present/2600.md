## Reading Resistors With OpenCV

-  Heres a tip from a wizened engineer Ive heard several times.

- If youre poking around a circuit that has failed, look at the resistor color codes.

- This is where the circuit was overheating, and youre probably very close to discovering the problem. The problem with this technique is that you have to look at and decode all the resistors.

- If automation and computer vision is more your thing, [Parth] made an Android app that will automatically tell you the value of a resistor by pointing a camera at it. The code uses OpenCV to scan a small line of pixels in the middle of the screen.

- Its perfect for scanning through a few hundred through hole resistors, if you dont want to learn the politically correct mnemonic theyre teaching these days. Video below, and the app is available for free on the Google Play store.

## Hacker 3D prints device that can crack a combo lock in 30 seconds

- Its a moderately tricky thing to do, requiring some software, so now hes mechanized the process with the Combo Breaker device. The Combo Breaker uses a stepper motor to rotate the Master Lock combination dial, a servo motor to try and open the mechanism, an Arduino chip to run the software, and 3D printed parts to house the lock and ensure a firm fit with the dial controller. If you merely slip a Master Lock into the device and set it running, the Combo Breaker will take about five minutes to find the combination  which is worrying, but not very useful if youre trying to, for example, break into someones high school or gym locker. But if you use Kamkars earlier method to prime the device by finding the first digit of the combination by hand  something thats relatively easy to do  then the Combo Breaker can do the job in 30 seconds or less.

- Thats quick enough to be a serious problem in the right circumstances (and the wrong hands). Before you start panicking, Kamkar tested the device on a cheaper version of the Master Lock combination dial mechanism.

- The company makes tougher rotary combo locks and the Combo Breaker isnt guaranteed to work on all of them. This isnt not the first time Kamkar has caused a ruckus; hes been a major disruptive force in the tech industry for a while now.

- At 18, he co-founded Fonality, a multimillion dollar communications company, but then got seriously into hacking. When he was 20, Kamkar created the Samy worm and released it onto MySpace, forcing the site to shut down temporarily.

- The worm was one of the fastest-spreading in history, and although it didnt carry a malicious payload, it still earned him a visit from US law enforcement and a felony charge of computer hacking. Since then hes demonstrated critical weaknesses in near-field communications and RFID chips, discovered a major flaw in PHP, and learned how to hijack drones in mid-flight.

## Polygraph.com owner pleads guilty to helping others beat lie detector

- A former cop and owner of the website Polygraph.com has pleaded guilty to five charges of obstruction of justice and mail fraud for teaching people how to cheat lie detector tests. Douglas Williams, 69, of Norman, Oklahoma, faces up to 20 years in jail and up to a $250,000 fine for selling polygraph-evasion training to two clients who were actually part of an undercover sting operation.

- Do you think you have, do you think you have like a lawyer confidentiality with me? But in truth, Williams was undeterred and continued to train the self-styled DHS agent.

- He grew paranoid and told his client to change his cell phone number and to respond to a new email he sent him from the paranoid chicken. Then just hours later he changed his mind about changing the telephone number and focused instead on getting paid through an untraceable money order. Money talks Ten days later, Williams flew to meet the so-called DHS agent, who again admitted he had helped smuggle drugs on four occasions.

- Nonetheless, Williams continued to train him in how to lie  which is a big no-no when you work for the US Department of Justice. Lying, deception and fraud cannot be allowed to influence the hiring of national security and law enforcement officials, particularly when it might affect the security of our borders, said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell of the Justice Departments Criminal Division in a statement announcing Williams guilty plea.

- I can teach you how to pass, nervous or not, no matter what. But the Justice Department holds that he crossed the line when he readily trained people who he believed had criminal records and were hoping to conceal their crimes from government authorities.

## Chinese cyber-spies hid botnet controls in MS TechNet comments

- Cyber-spies are increasingly attempting to hide their command and control operations in plain sight by burying their command infrastructure in the forums of internet heavyweights, including Microsoft. FireEye and Microsoft have successfully shut down the Chinese threat actor APT17s use of the MSFT TechNet blog to hide their hacking operations.

- State-sponsored hackers were posting comments on TechNet in order to embed encoded commands that only their malware could use. APT17, a China-based advanced persistent threat group, posted in forum threads and created profile pages to host encoded C2 IP addresses that would direct a variant of the BLACKCOFFEE backdoor to their C2 server.

- TechNets security was not compromised by this tactic, which could also work on other forums and boards. Most threat actors choose to compromise or hijack easily manipulated websites to host command and control nodes, which is a very noisy tactic that allows for quick detection of their location.

- APT17s tactics of embedding phone home instructions on Microsofts forums are more subtle, but not unprecedented in the wider field of botnet communications.

- APT17 had been observed using popular search engines including Google and Bing to hide their activities and host locations from security researchers. This latest tactic by APT17 of using websites legitimate functionalities to conduct their communications shows just how difficult it is for organisations to detect and prevent advanced threats, said Laura Galante, manager, threat intelligence, FireEye.

## All About Tor

- A little bit ago NCC Group North America had an all-hands retreat, and solicited technical talks.

- I fired off a one-line e-mail: "All About Tor - Everything from the Directory Authorities to the Link Protocol to Pluggable Transports to everything in between."

- I ended up building the deck, with a level of detail I thought was about 80% of what I wanted, and gave a dry-run for my 45 minute talk.

- It ran two full hours. I cut a bunch of content for the talk, but knew I would need to finish the whole thing and make it available.

- The source for the presentation is available in keynote format. Major thanks to all the folks I bugged to build this, especially Nick Mathewson, and those who gave me feedback on mailing lists.

## Heartbleed, eat your heart out: VENOM vuln poisons countless VMs

- An attacker could also potentially access data or execute code on other guest VMs running on the same host system. The bug is considered highly dangerous, because it affects not only systems running QEMU itself, but also other virtualization software that takes advantage of QEMU, including the widely used KVM and Xen open source hypervisors. The affected software will be vulnerable regardless of what operating system it is running on, because QEMU is built from the same code base for all platforms, including Linux, OS X, Windows, and others. QEMU is hardly the only hardware virtualization software in town, however, and other hypervisors that dont use any QEMU code  including Bochs, Microsoft Hyper-V, and VMware  are not affected. How deadly is VENOM?  How VENOM can strike / Source: CrowdStrike (click to enlarge)  The neglected operations part of the VENOM name refers to the all-but-forgotten portion of the QEMU code where the flaw is found.

- Yet VENOM is risky enough to be considered a high-priority vulnerability. In order to mount an exploit attempt, a user on the guest machine would need sufficient permissions to access the floppy disk controller I/O ports.

- Vulnerabilities like VENOM are mostly viewed as an avenue for a highly targeted attack like corporate espionage, cyber warfare or the like. Companies with systems that contain the affected software should definitely contact their vendors and apply the appropriate patches, Eng said.

- Fortunately, several of the more prominent cloud providers were made aware of VENOM before the public disclosure and have been working behind the scenes to ensure that their customers are protected. Rackspace told El Reg that the vulnerability affected a portion of its cloudy servers, but added, We have applied the appropriate patch to our infrastructure and are working with customers to fully remediate this vulnerability. Amazon Web Services, meanwhile, said its customers neednt worry.

- There is no risk to AWS customer data or instances, a spokesman told The Reg. Customer security is our top priority, and AWS takes extraordinary defense in depth measures in constructing systems that do not rely solely upon any single component, such as the hypervisor, to protect customers. Microsofts Azure cloud, on the other hand, uses Redmonds own hypervisor technology, and thus isnt affected by VENOM.

## A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering: Attack of the week: Logjam

- Nicknamed Logjam

- it may admit complete decryption or hijacking of any TLS connection you make to an improperly configured web or mail server

- similar (and more powerful) attacks might already be in the toolkit of some state-level attackers such as the NSA.

- the Diffie-Hellman protocol, as currently deployed in SSL/TLS, may be vulnerable to a serious downgrade attack that restores it to 1990s "export" levels of security

- offers a practical "break" of the TLS protocol against poorly configured servers

- extrapolation of the attack requirements -- combined with evidence from the Snowden documents -- provides some reason to speculate that a similar attack could be leveraged against protocols (including TLS, IPSec/IKE and SSH) using 768- and 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman.

- Richard Kettlewell currently owns greenend.org.uk. Look for, and fail to find, the lock icon and the https:// URL scheme.

- Scroll down and note that Tatham offers links to RSA and DSA cryptographic signatures of the binaries, e.g.

## Augmented Traffic Control: A tool to simulate network conditions

- We bought two old, secondhand base stations and some mobile phones to start, and spread the word that we were looking for other people to join our effort. At the Infra Hackathon in February 2013, the Augmented Traffic Control team began work on simulating a small-scale 2G network, using base stations and mobile phones. Right away, more engineers signed up to help, and after getting a solid start at the Hackathon, we acquired a good understanding of the cellular software protocols by configuring the software components and analyzing how they communicated with one another.

- Acquiring reasonably priced cellular radios that would reliably run open source base station software was time-consuming. Pivoting to Wi-Fi It was at another infrastructure Hackathon in May 2013 that we decided to shift our focus.

- Once we had something we could share with them, we wanted to get their feedback. Augmented Traffic Control in practice The other teams that used ATC found that it helped save time and pointed out weaknesses in their work.

- They ran automated tests in which the bandwidth connections were changed in order to look at how long Messenger should wait before timing out and how many retries were optimal to send messages.

- We want to give the open source community the same chance to improve on our ideas and innovate with their own  so today we are open-sourcing our design for Augmented Traffic Control on GitHub. Thanks to the following people, who contributed to Augmented Traffic Control across its lifetime: Alessandro Salvatori, Ameesh Goyal, Andrew Pope, Anthony Gargiulo, Chris Vander Mey, Emmanuel Bretelle, Gus Luxton, John Morrow, Patrick Shuff, and Zeal Jagannatha.

- called the War on Crypto Terror, governments aim to impose backdoors on digital devices in order to thwart crime

- The debate is well-explored in Bitcoin. Anonymity tools like Darkwallet

- Contemporary digital technologies offer Governments, corporations, criminals and pranksters unprecedented capacity to interfere with the rights to freedom of opinion and expression.

- Blanket prohibitions fail to be necessary and proportionate. States should avoid all measures that weaken the security that individuals may enjoy online, such as backdoors, weak encryption standards and key escrows.

- One example is a police officer carrying around handcuff keys on a belt clip. Pose for a picture and that key design is now available to all

- A master key for the NYC Subway was compromised and available for sale.

- Worse, was the availability of fire-department master keys which open lock boxes outside of every building.

- the news coverage showed each key on a white background, straight on, with annotations of where each type of key will work.

## Avago Buys Broadcom For $37 Billion

-  The economy is doing well, and that means companies are spending money.

- The latest such deal is Avago Technologies buying Broadcom for $37 Billion USD  the largest deal ever made in the semiconductor industry. The products made by these two companies arent usually found in stock at Adafruit, Sparkfun, or in the BOMs on Hackaday.io, but that doesnt mean these chips arent extremely popular in the industry.

- Avago has a huge catalog of RF goodies and a surprising number of LED products.

- Broadcom, outside of the SoC found in the Raspberry Pi, likewise isnt seen very often on workbenches, but their chips are found in everything from set-top boxes to Ethernet and broadband equipment. Just a few months ago, a merger between NXP and Freescale struck a little bit closer to our hearts, but there is an opportunity for this acquisition to be much more interesting.

- The company that emerges from the NXP and Freescale merger will be saddled with hundreds of chip lines that all compete with each other  a cornucopia of ARMs, 8051s, Kinetis, iMX.6, and ColdFires, and thats just microcontrollers.

## Hot Topic To Buy ThinkGeek Parent Company Geeknet

- Even a 1 pound ground package will be cost something close to $7-10 and probably more if it is any distance.

- I promise you that you cannot do it. It isn't $3 and won't be unless you ship a HUGE (meaning many tens of thousands) number of packages.

- Your perception of what it should cost to ship doesn't match reality. High prices does not mean they are necessarily profitable and no it doesn't mean they necessarily can afford to ship stuff for free.

- Maybe they can but you simply don't have the information to make that judgement. There is no such thing as free shipping.

- If it is "free" then it is simply rolled into the price of the item, possibly at the expense of the profit margin of the vendor.

## A Text Message Can Crash An iPhone and Force It To Reboot

- So a person goes in and writes an app that inserts a new character at a particular byte offset and it works 99.99% of the time, but if it happens to get stuck in the middle of a multi-code-unit glyph, the program breaks. The documentation is no help.

- The [Unicode] standard defines a universal, uniform encoding scheme that is 16 bits per character. As we all should know, that's simply not true.

- These two primitive methods provide basic access to a string object. characterAtIndex returns a 16-bit integer.

- And now I'd bet that it or something similar has created a brand new iPhone-equivalent of Winnuke. Programmers really need two types of strings, and only two, for the lion's share of tasks.

- One, binary strings, where a char is always 8 bytes and operations can be optimized to heck and back.

## Chris Ball  Announcing GitTorrent: A Decentralized GitHub

- To look at it another way: the experience of our collaboration around open source projects is currently being defined by the unmodifiable tools that GitHub has decided that we should use. So thats the practical and philosophical, and I guess Ill call the third reason the ironical.

- Checking connectivity... done. In this demo we again cloned a Git repository over BitTorrent, but we didnt need to talk to GitHub at all, because we found out what commit we were aiming for by asking our distributed hash table instead.

- Maybe the app would monitor the blockchain and write to a database table, and then thered be a plugin for web and network service frameworks that knows how to understand the contents of that table. It surprised me that nothing like this seems to exist already in the decentralization community.

- One implementation of this idea is Bugs Everywhere. We could also imagine issues and pull requests living on Secure Scuttlebutt, which synchronizes append-only message streams across decentralized networks. Im happy just to have got this far, though, and Id love to hear your comments on this design.

- The design of GitTorrent itself is (ironically enough) on GitHub and Id welcome pull requests to make any aspect of it better. Id like to say a few thank yous  first to Feross Aboukhadijeh, who wrote the BitTorrent libraries that Im using here.

- And one of the main points of things like SSH servers is cross-compile farms and remote access.

- And almost all the universities that offer such services recommend PuTTY if you're on Windows (because they've dealt with the Cygwin issues, I assure you, and decided it's not worth the hassle). Opinion, of course.

- Just because it's contrary doesn't make it more or less valid. However, PuTTY is widely used and recommended for everything from talking to your Arduino's over a serial port to logging into your University server... go take a look.

- Cygwin - if and when it comes up - is not mentioned in nearly as many places for such simple actions. Cygwin is, in fact, overkill for the majority of users who just want to use SSH, telnet or serial services from Windows.

## More on Chris Roberts and Avionics Security

- But to me, the fascinating part of this story is that a computer was monitoring the Twitter feed and understood the obscure references, alerted a person who figured out who wrote them, researched what flight he was on, and sent an FBI team to the Syracuse airport within a couple of hours.

- agents in February and March of this year, Roberts said he hacked the inflight entertainment systems of Boeing and Airbus aircraft, during flights, about 15 to 20 times between 2011 and 2014.

- In one instance, Roberts told the federal agents he hacked into an airplanes thrust management computer and momentarily took control of an engine, according to an affidavit attached to the application for a search warrant.

- More than likely a multi-bus frame houses a number of IFE boards that run a Linux variant on top of a supervisorwithout a redundant PS (weight savings over time can be substantial given fuel costs).

- Id suspect a modern aircraft would include two or more physical transports (wire, fiber, electro-mechanical) to insure that flight surface controls (fly-by-wire) remain operational.

FreeBSD 9.x, and certain (Old) versions of Centos/RHEL when compiling
against the vendor's OpenSSL

- The only resolution is "Too bad,

It has power-management (X-Powers AXP209 PMIC chip) designed into it, allowing for easy operation and charging of batteries.

- Ill be interested to explore the latency of the GPIO when I can get my hands on one of these; an issue weve heard about with Raspberry Pi powered devices. You Can Take it With You Im not quite sure what to think about the Pocket C.H.I.P. Its a portable-form-factor which has a huge screen and a full keyboard.

## US plans to apply export controls to 0-days put out for comment

- US proposals for export controls for zero-day vulnerabilities and malware have finally been pushed forward, re-opening the fault lines of a long-running argument among security experts in the process. The proposals (pdf) from the US Department of Commerce would introduce the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA)  an international agreement forged in December 2013  into US law.

- This rule thus continues applicable Encryption Items (EI) registration and review requirements, while setting forth proposed license review policies and special submission requirements to address the new cybersecurity controls, including submission of a letter of explanation with regard to the technical capabilities of the cybersecurity items.

- Some critics compare the measures to export controls on strong encryption and attempts to curtail the distribution of PGP back in the 1990s. Others argue it may impede the development of Bug Bounty programmes, schemes increasingly adopted by vendors as a way of accelerating the discovery and remediation of security flaws, while offering researchers who find them payment for their efforts. Although the rules apply to exports outside North America, provision to give Australia, the UK and New Zealand favourable treatment is already written into the draft rules.

- Theres no suggestion that the rules will do anything to interfere with the Five Eyes intel agency alliance. Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the ACLU, has done more than anyone to highlight concerns over the controversial exploit vulnerability marketplace the the US regulation might affect. Hes already come in for a bit of stick for lobbying for export controls 2.0, but has yet to respond to that criticism or the US governments plans.

- Governmental use of Trojans, exploits and hacking is growing and this is commonly directed at internal dissidents, as well as external targets.

## HTTPS-crippling attack threatens tens of thousands of Web and mail servers

-  Wikipedia  Tens of thousands of HTTPS-protected websites, mail servers, and other widely used Internet services are vulnerable to a new attack that lets eavesdroppers read and modify data passing through encrypted connections, a team of computer scientists has found. The vulnerability affects an estimated 8.4 percent of the top one million websites and a slightly bigger percentage of mail servers populating the IPv4 address space, the researchers said.

- The threat stems from a flaw in the transport layer security protocol that websites and mail servers use to establish encrypted connections with end users.

- Using precomputed data prepared ahead of time, the attackers can then deduce the encryption key negotiated between the two parties. Logjam shows us once again why its a terrible idea to deliberately weaken cryptography, as the FBI and some in law enforcement are now calling for, J. Alex Halderman, one of the scientists behind the research, wrote in an e-mail to Ars.

- The researchers said they have been working with developers of major browsers and that Chrome, Firefox, and Safari are also expected to implement a fix that rejects encrypted connections unless the key material contains a minimum of 1024 bits.

- Besides attacking HTTPS-protected Web and e-mail sessions, the researchers said, the same technique may be used to break SSH and VPN connections, too. The technical details of our attack have also let us look at some of the leaked NSA documents in a new light, and give an explanation consistent with the documents and our experiments of how the NSA might be breaking certain crypto protocols on a wide scale, Nadia Heninger, a scientist at the University of Pennsylvania and an author of the paper, wrote in an e-mail. In the short term, the researchers recommend all server administrators disable support for the DHE_EXPORT ciphersuites that allow Diffie-Hellman connections to be downgraded.

- A plane in the US had to be diverted and two passengers removed after one of them started a fight by using a banned device to stop the seat in front reclining.

- one passenger was using the Knee Defender, a $21.95 lock that attaches to a tray table and jams the reclining mechanism of the seat in front.

- male passenger, seated in a middle seat of row 12, used the device to stop the woman in front of him reclining while he was on his laptop

- A flight attendant asked him to remove the device and he refused.

- The woman then stood up, turned around and threw a cup of water at him, the official said.

- The Federal Aviation Administration leaves it up to individual airlines to set rules about the device. United Airlines says it prohibits its use, like all major US airlines.

The USA Freedom Act shows that the digital rights community has leveled up.

## Firefox's Optional Tracking Protection Reduces Load Time For News Sites By 44%

- When Newegg includes a 1px image from criteo.com, criteo is no longer a 3rd party.

- When newegg directs "promotions.newegg.com" to edgesuite.net, then edgesuite is no longer a 3rd party (and in a way that is much more difficult for even clever ad blocking software to detect). The point they're trying to raise here is that including all of those web-bugs and their associated cookies does impact the visitor experience, and FF has a system to reduce it.

- You can take this from the user perspective: here's an easy way to speed up the web, without having to figure out which of the adblocking plug ins are really legit.

- You can look at it from the host perspective: if web bugs make your whole web site feel much slower, then maybe the analytics aren't worth it.

- Every time someone stands up and says it takes longer to load all the ads on most pages than the actual content, a few more people will understand the cost of "free' web pages.

## Linux/Moose Worm Targets Routers, Modems, and Embedded Systems

- It's news not because of OS(I don't know if they bothered; but exploits at the 'just use the default password against the external telnet interface' level would work against basically any OS, and the only real obstacle to executing a payload with the functions described would be that some of the really nasty VXworks-based devices are so RAM-starved that they can barely do their job, much less run malware at the same time); but because the security of nearly all 'consumer', and a disturbing number of more expensive, embedded devices is still utter shit. It is bad enough that such plastic-box devices typically are shipping software well behind the curve(2.6X kernels, http servers with vulnerabilities that were closed upstream months before the device in question was released, that sort of thing); but 'default configuration leaves telnet listening on the WAN port, with weak credentials for root login' goes well beyond 'bug' and right into 'We Just Don't Care' territory.

- Even better, the same damn story has been true for at least the past decade, probably longer(though its importance has increased as the cost has fallen and number of little embedded boxes lurking around has skyrocketed). At least on the desktop and server, some of the worst insecure-by-default atrocities have been ironed out, so attackers are now moderately likely to need to use vaguely clever vulnerabilities(even if they can often get away with ones that were patched months ago) or social engineering; but embedded crap hasn't even reached that level of security. The fact that telnet is even there(outside of 'recovery' scenarios, where the emergency nature of the situation and availability of only the most limited resources make super-simple protocols like telnet and TFTP valuable) when OpenSSH has been available for the last 15 years, and less liberally licensed versions a bit longer, is disgusting in itself.

- Having it on the WAN, much less by default, is just depraved.

## eBay bug turns phishing email links into malware-stuffed booby prizes

- eBay is racing to fix a second serious security flaw that may allow criminals to spread malware through files seemingly hosted by the online tat bazaar. The bug is closely related to an earlier one discovered by David Sopas, a researcher at security firm WebSegura in Portugal.

- When using eBay and inspecting its requests, I noticed a call to a JSON file that made me wonder a bit about a security vulnerability  Reflected Filename Download, he said in an advisory, which has since been taken offline. To the victim the entire process looked like a file was offered for download by eBay trusted domain and it would not raise any suspicious.

- A malicious user could gain total control over a victims computer and launch multiple attacks. Sopas told the ThreatPost blog that hed spotted similar bugs in Facebook and Instagram, vulnerabilities that have since been fixed. Reflected Filename Download flaws are fairly common, he opined, but fixing them can be tricky.

- The attack typically involves smuggling a malicious executable batch file in a semi-legit-looking URL, which could be sent in phishing email spam.

- Clicking on the link downloads the data to disk, which when opened by a naive user will starts the installation of software nasties.  Youtube Video  Sonas told The Register that he had informed eBay of the problem with one of its web pages, and held back from fully disclosing the vulnerability until the online souk had fixed the hole and given him the go-ahead.

## Tessel 2, A $35 Linux Computer Thats Truly Open Source

-  Weve seen the first version of the Tessel a few years ago, and its still an interesting board: an ARM Cortex-M3 running at 180MHz, WiFi, 32 Megs of both Flash and RAM, and something that can be programmed entirely in JavaScript or Node.js.

- Since then, the company behind Tessel, Technical Machines, has started work on the Tessel 2, a board thats continuing in the long tradition of taking chips from WiFi routers and making a dev board out of them.

- The Tessel 2 features a MediaTek MT7620 running Linux built on OpenWRT, Ethernet, 802.11bgn WiFi, an Atmel SAMD21 serving as a real-time I/O coprocessor, two USB ports, and everything can still be controlled through JavaScript, Node, with support for Rust and other languages in the works. Instead of going the usual route and determining the future of Tessel through market research and the apparent pragmatism of whoever happens to be in charge, this week Technical Machines did something wonderful: the ownership and direction of the Tessel Project is now independent of Technical Machine.

- This makes Tessel a completely open source and community driven platform for I0T, robots, and whatever else would benefit from an open source community disconnected from hardware. The Tessel project is completely disconnected from manufacturers, something the Arduino project has been struggling with for the last few years, unbeknownst to most of the founders for most of that time.

## Quiz: Just how Kafkaesque is the court that oversees NSA spying?

-   An undated file photo of famed author Franz Kafka.

- Founded in 1978 after the Watergate scandal and investigations by the Church Committee, the FISA court was supposed to be a bulwark against secret government surveillance.

- In 2006, it authorized the NSA call records program  the single largest domestic surveillance program in American history. The court in Franz Kafkas novel The Trial is a shadowy tribunal that tries (and executes) Josef K., the storys protagonist, without informing him of the crime hes charged with, the witnesses against him, or how he can defend himself.

- A few months before the Snowden disclosures, four senators asked the FISA court to declassify summaries of some of those opinions.

## How the end of Patriot Act provisions changes NSA surveillance

-  Trevor Paglen  Thanks to resistance from Senator Rand Paul and other members of the Senate, the provisions of the USA PatriotAct that were used to justify the National Security Administrations broad collection of phone call metadata have expired.

- The USA Freedom Act, in the form it was passed by the House of Representatives, would put the phone companies in charge of retaining call dataand allow the NSA to query that data where it rests. According to a letter sent by NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers to Senators Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Harry Reid (D-Nev.), shifting to a query at the provider model is achievable within 180 days, with provider cooperation.

- We are aware of no technical or security reasons why this cannot be tested and brought on line within the 180-day period [specified by the USA Freedom Act]. The NSA is very familiar with distributed query models that would be required for the new approach to worktheyre at the core of XKeyscore.

- If anything, it might actually help reduce the demands on the NSAs network connections to telco providers. XKeyscore currently provides a federated search capability that can query its data stores around the world for information related to a specific identifier.

- If the only real changes are to where the data is stored, metadata queries will still potentially be open to abuses such as those already documented by the NSAquerying phone metadata of girlfriends and ex-girlfriends, boyfriends and wives, and other random individuals. In other words, the technical substance of NSA phone record surveillance may change, but the capabilities will not.

## China cracks down further on VPNs as censorship intensifies

- Chinas government is cracking down further on the use of virtual private networks to circumnavigate its Great Firewall, as part of the ongoing game of whack-a-mole between censors and an increasingly tech-savvy population. Charlie Smith, co-founder of the censorship in China monitoring site GreatFire.org, said there has been a significant increase in the usage of VPN services over the last year.

- The knock-on effects of this can be seen through increased activity on blocked sites such as Twitter. However, Smith said the authorities have recently cracked down hard on the most popular commercial VPNs. New upstarts might garner the same attention once they hit critical masses of users.

- I hope that this does not happen, but recent trends indicate that this will be the likely end result. According to sources, the countrys hugely popular online shopping platform Taobao no longer sells VPNs, with keyword searches for the services now blocked.

- A search on Chinas Baidu reveals more people are asking where to buy VPNs, although there are still plenty of sites selling them. Adam Fisk, chief executive of free peer-to-peer internet censorship circumvention software Lantern, said VPNs are particularly vulnerable to blocking because censors can easily target their protocols. In contrast Lantern uses a combination of peer-to-peer overseas connections and tunnelling traffic through services censors dont want to block. To me this is an ongoing battle with continuing innovation on both sides.

- The service now has 500 million active users, raising the question of how practical it is becoming to police. Fisk said: I definitely think theres a danger of being too optimistic, but [ultimately] the government is fighting a battle against hundreds of millions of people who have a fundamental desire to access information and programmers who have a fundamental desire to innovate. Over the long term I think the latter will clearly win, but its unclear how long it will take, he added. Smith agreed: [We] believe that a combination of technological solutions and widespread adoption of these tools will make free access to information so commonplace that the authorities decide that there is no point in fighting back.

## Evil Wi-Fi captive portal could spoof Apple Pay to get users credit card data

- The vulnerability, based on the default behavior of iOS devices with Wi-Fi turned on, could be used to inject a fake captive portal page that imitates the Apple Pay interface. The attack leverages a well-known issue Ars has reported on in the past: iOS devices with Wi-Fi turned on will attempt by default to connect to any access point with a known SSID.

- A rogue access point could use a probe request capture to masquerade as a known network, and then throw up a pop-up screen masquerading as any web page or app. The Wandera attack uses this behavior to get a mobile device to connect and then presents a pop-up portal pagethe type usually used when connecting to a public WiFi service to present a Web-based login screenthat is designed to resemble an Apple Pay screen for entering credit card data.

- Using readily available technology, which they may be discretely carrying about their person, hackers can for the first time focus their efforts where their victims are at their most susceptibleat the checkout. The real vulnerability exploited here is iOS automatic WiFi connection and the format in which iOS displays captive portal pages.

- The Wandera researchers reccommended that Apple and Google should consider adopting a secure warning when displaying captive portal pages to users, so that users exercise caution. Additionally, they suggest that users close and re-open payment applications to enter credit card data and use the camera capture capability of the apps to input credit card data whenever possible. Ars spoke with an Apple spokesperson, and is awaiting an official response.

- However, as the screenshots show, this spoof looks considerably different from Apple Pays actual interface, and a card registration screen popping up after a transaction is hardly expected behavior for the service.

- The Washington Post, citing unnamed government officials, reported that the attack originated from Chinese hackers, and was the second major intrusion of the agency by China in less than a year.

- OPM has instituted additional network security precautions, including: restricting remote access for network administrators and restricting network administration functions remotely; a review of all connections to ensure that only legitimate business connections have access to the internet; and deploying anti-malware software across the environment to protect and prevent the deployment or execution of tools that could compromise the network.

## FBI: Apple and Google are helping ISIS by offering strong crypto

- Apple and Google are helping terrorism by offering users encrypted communications, a senior FBI official has told the House Homeland Security Committee in Congress, and US law enforcement needs to stop them from doing it. Michael Steinbach, assistant director in the FBIs Counterterrorism Division, told Congress that ISIS and other terrorist groups are using commercially available encryption technology to mask their activities, leading law enforcement surveillance to go dark.

- As far as the FBI is concerned, private companies must build technological solutions to prevent encryption above all else, the Washington Post reports Steinbach as saying. Thats a pretty sharp reverse ferret from the FBI, which four years ago was recommending encryption as a basic security measure.

- But Steinbach said evildoers are hiding behind US-made technology to mask their actions. Encryption appears to be a big problem for law enforcement, both foreign and domestic.

- But the FBI wasnt insisting on back door access to encryption; rather, it wants companies to work directly with law enforcement where necessary. Privacy above all other things, including safety and freedom from terrorism, is not where we want to go, Steinbach said.

- But the intelligence community is wedded to the idea that it should be easy to build an encryption system thats both secure and has a breakable access code. The problem is that the best minds in the field say doing so is mathematically impossible, and even if it were possible, youd be painting a target on your back by telling the world theres a hack available and daring them to find it.

## Apple Watch Security Flaw: Thieves can continue to use Apple Pay | BGR

-  A potential security vulnerability recently detailed by a blogger may have uncovered a serious flaw in the Apple Watchs design that could lead to some big headaches for some users.

- In a nutshell, a nifty feature designed by Apple to maintain security on the Watch without sacrificing convenience may have actually ended up sacrificing security instead, allowing thieves to continue using Apple Pay on a stolen Watch without having to input the owners PIN code to confirm purchases. It should be noted, however, that the procedure detailed by the blogger in question did not yield consistent results.

- As such, a thief would seemingly need a bit of luck in order to ensure that he or she can exploit this vulnerability. DONT MISS: Netflix is testing a redesign that users are going to love  see it first right here The security setup on Apples Watch is actually quite brilliant.

- This also allows users to make payments with Apple Pay without the need to verify them by inputting a PIN. These sensors can also detect when the Watch has been removed from a persons wrist.

- Then, once the damage is done, he or she can reset the Apple Watch using the vulnerability we detailed in an earlier post, and then sell it using sites like eBay or Craigslist. The video embedded below shows how simple it is to exploit this vulnerability.

## Detecting Network Traffic from Metasploits Meterpreter Reverse HTTP Module

- The 16 alphanumeric characters are chosen at random, and the 4 or 5 alphanumeric characters are some kind of checksum. I checked Meteasploits source code: these characteristics of Meterpreters Reverse HTTP protocol are hardcoded. What is not hardcoded, but parametrized with a variable, is the User Agent String.

- By default, it is Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.1; Windows NT), but it is an option that can be changed. Ive tested the detection of Metasploit Meterpreter traffic with this User Agent String in several environments, and never encountered a false positive.

- The only User Agent String seen in-the-wild that comes close to this one is Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.1; Windows XP).

- Thats why I also developed a method to detect Metasploit Meterpreter Reverse HTTP traffic looking for its hardcoded characteristics: a POST request with RECV payload to a recognizable URI. Here is the Snort rule: # Snort rules by Didier Stevens (http://DidierStevens.com) # 2015/05/01 - 2015/05/10 # Thanks to Nathan Fowler for helping out with performance optimization # I start numbering my rules at SID 1618000 alert tcp $HOME_NET any - $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"Metasploit Meterpreter"; flow:to_server,established; content:"RECV"; http_client_body; depth:4; fast_pattern; isdataat:!0,relative; urilen:2324,norm; content:"POST"; pcre:"/^\/[a-z0-9]{4,5}_[a-z0-9]{16}\/$/Ui"; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,blog.didierstevens.com/2015/05/11/detecting-network-traffic-from-metasploits-meterpreter-reverse-http-module/; sid:1618008; rev:1;)  This Snort rule looks for traffic from your internal network to the outside.

- You need to change the rule if you want to detect internal-only traffic. Here is an example of an alert: [**] [1:1618008:1] Metasploit Meterpreter [**] [Classification: A Network Trojan was detected] [Priority: 1] 05/11-22:26:31.236007 192.168.174.1:54949 - 192.168.174.137:80 TCP TTL:64 TOS:0x0 ID:21177 IpLen:20 DgmLen:212 DF ***A**** Seq: 0x1B677291  Ack: 0x861008DD  Win: 0x7680  TcpLen: 20 [Xref = http://blog.didierstevens.com/2015/05/11/detecting-network-traffic-from-metasploits-meterpreter-reverse-http-module/]  Based on the Metasploit User Agent Strings I published a couple of months ago, I made these Snort rules: # Snort rules by Didier Stevens (http://DidierStevens.com) # 2015/04/30 # I start numbering my rules at SID 1618000 #alert tcp $HOME_NET any - $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"Metasploit User Agent String"; flow:to_server,established; content:"User-Agent|3a| Mozilla/4.0 (compatible\; MSIE 6.0\; Windows NT 5.1)|0d 0a|"; http_header; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,blog.didierstevens.com/2015/03/16/quickpost-metasploit-user-agent-strings/; sid:1618000; rev:1;) alert tcp $HOME_NET any - $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"Metasploit User Agent String"; flow:to_server,established; content:"User-Agent|3a| Mozilla/4.0 (compatible\; MSIE 6.1\; Windows NT)|0d 0a|"; http_header; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,blog.didierstevens.com/2015/03/16/quickpost-metasploit-user-agent-strings/; sid:1618001; rev:1;) #alert tcp $HOME_NET any - $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"Metasploit User Agent String"; flow:to_server,established; content:"User-Agent|3a| Mozilla/4.0 (compatible\; MSIE 7.0\; Windows NT 6.0)|0d 0a|"; http_header; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,blog.didierstevens.com/2015/03/16/quickpost-metasploit-user-agent-strings/; sid:1618002; rev:1;) alert tcp $HOME_NET any - $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"Metasploit User Agent String"; flow:to_server,established; content:"User-Agent|3a| Mozilla/4.0 (compatible\; MSIE 7.0\; Windows NT 6.0\; Trident/4.0\; SIMBAR={7DB0F6DE-8DE7-4841-9084-28FA914B0F2E}\; SLCC1\; .N|0d 0a|"; http_header; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,blog.didierstevens.com/2015/03/16/quickpost-metasploit-user-agent-strings/; sid:1618003; rev:1;) alert tcp $HOME_NET any - $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"Metasploit User Agent String"; flow:to_server,established; content:"User-Agent|3a| Mozilla/4.0 (compatible\; Metasploit RSPEC)|0d 0a|"; http_header; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,blog.didierstevens.com/2015/03/16/quickpost-metasploit-user-agent-strings/; sid:1618004; rev:1;) #alert tcp $HOME_NET any - $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"Metasploit User Agent String"; flow:to_server,established; content:"User-Agent|3a| Mozilla/5.0 (Windows\; U\; Windows NT 5.1\; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.221.6 Safari/525.13|0d 0a|"; http_header; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,blog.didierstevens.com/2015/03/16/quickpost-metasploit-user-agent-strings/; sid:1618005; rev:1;) alert tcp $HOME_NET any - $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"Metasploit User Agent String"; flow:to_server,established; content:"User-Agent|3a| Mozilla/5.0 (compatible\; Googlebot/2.1\; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)|0d 0a|"; http_header; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,blog.didierstevens.com/2015/03/16/quickpost-metasploit-user-agent-strings/; sid:1618006; rev:1;) #alert tcp $HOME_NET any - $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"Metasploit User Agent String"; flow:to_server,established; content:"User-Agent|3a| Mozilla/5.0 (compatible\; MSIE 10.0\; Windows NT 6.1\; Trident/6.0)|0d 0a|"; http_header; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,blog.didierstevens.com/2015/03/16/quickpost-metasploit-user-agent-strings/; sid:1618007; rev:1;)  Remark that I commented-out the Snort rules that I expect to generate too many false positives.

- Patch now!The bug, which is known to affect the Xen, KVM, and native QEMU virtual machine platforms and appliances, makes it possible for attackers to break out of protected guest environments and take full control of the operating system hosting them, security researchers warned Wednesday.

- In a blog post published a few hours after the vulnerability came to light, Graham wrote: The details look straightforward, which means a PoC should arrive by tomorrow. This is a hypervisor privilege escalation bug.

- Bitcoin wallets, RSA private keys, forum passwords, and the like are easily found searching raw memory.

- Assuming the NSA had a program that theyd debugged over the years that looked for such stuff, for $100,000 they could buy a ton of $10 VPS instances around the world, then run the search.

- And theres even better reason to chafe at media reports comparing the severity of Venom to last years catastrophic Heartbleed vulnerability.

## Typing 'http://:' Into a Skype Message Trashes the Installation Beyond Repair

- So much this. I usually defend MS against people who I believe unfairly attack them, but you've really struck a nerve. I don't know what team is responsible for Skype, but they have done such a mind boggling horrible job I'm half convinced they're intentionally trying to kill it, cut it into small pieces, then burn the remains before firing the ashes into the nearest black hole. Every single version they push out has been worse than the last, and the last good version was 6.18.

- Somehow it managed to uninstall itself and then couldn't reinstall itself because I replaced the update file with a dummy. They keep removing features but *promise* to put them back in... And even years later the features still haven't back in added.

- That's all Skype gets nowadays, useless improvements and worse performance.

- The calls I get with 6.18 are perfect but with any version 7 I may as well just write letters and send them through the mail. Oh but wait they changed the UI to be even worse!

- Maybe you should hire actual software developers instead of monkey interns who think smashing their face into a keyboard is an acceptable way to write software.

## White-box cryptography

-  WBC: protecting cryptographic keys in software applications   Cryptography is increasingly deployed in applications that are executed on open devices (such as PCs, tablets or smartphones).

-  Therefore, white-box cryptography (WBC) is an essential technology in any software protection strategy.

- Without this, attackers could easily grab secret keys from the binary implementation, from memory, or intercept information that would lead to disclosure at execution time.

-   WBC could be seen as a special purpose code generator that turns a given cipher into a robust representation.

-   The figure below depicts a conceptual high-level overview of WBC, for the case of a fixed key implementation.

## Silk Road Creator Ross Ulbricht Sentenced to Life in Prison | WIRED

- On Friday Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole

- Judge Katherine Forrest gave Ulbricht the most severe sentence possible, beyond what even the prosecution had explicitly requested.

- Ulbricht was also ordered to pay a massive restitution of more than $183 million, what the prosecution had estimated to be the total sales of illegal drugs and counterfeit IDs through the Silk Road

- Ive changed. Im not the man I was when I created Silk Road, he said

- I wanted to empower people to make choices in their lives...to have privacy and anonymity, Ulbricht told the judge. Im not a sociopathic person trying to express some inner badness.

- seven felony charges, including conspiracies to traffic in narcotics and launder money, as well as a kingpin charge usually reserved for the leaders of organized crime groups.

- parents of drug users who had overdosed and died from drugs

- I strongly believe my son would still be alive today if Mr. Ulbricht had never created Silk Road, said one father whose 25-year old son had died from an overdose of heroin

## New relay selection fix for Tor to spoil spooks' fun (eventually)

- Research by American and Israeli academics has lead to the development of Astoria, a new Tor client specifically designed to spoil spooks traffic analysis of the surveillance-dodging network. Astoria all-but decimates the number of vulnerable connections on the Tor network, bringing the figure from 58 per cent of total users to 5.8 per cent, the researchers claim.

- Astoria hopes to utilise a new relay-selection algorithm which would prevent the asymmetric connections which make traffic analysis possible. Due to the large amounts of processing power needed to analyse the data passing through the Tor network, traffic analysis is only conceivable as a de-anonymising attack when it is launched by state actors, such as those in the Five Eyes surveillance alliance. Steven J. Murdoch, who along with George Danezis published a paper on the Low-Cost Traffic Analysis of Tor [PDF] back in 2005, told The Register that Traffic-analysis is quite a sophisticated surveillance technique, but one which intelligence agencies have extensive experience in. With enough computation power, access to communication links and expertise, traffic analysis will be able to de-anonymize the user of any low-latency anonymous communication system, including Tor, he added. A GCHQ document [PDF] published by Der Spiegal late last year, its release timed with a pair of talks at 31c3, by Tor Project bods and journalists, revealed that the viability of traffic analysis was being discussed amongst the Five Eyes alliance in 2011. Murdoch, who is a researcher at University College London said it has always been assumed that the major intelligence agencies would be able to de-anonymize at least some Tor users, so if anything Tor has been shown to have stood up better than many people had expected.

- However, recent work has shown that these strategies perform poorly in practice, said the paper (PDF).  Studying the use of ASes, the boffins found:  58 per cent of circuits constructed by Tor are vulnerable to network-level attackers.

- Reducing the number of entry guards results in an increase in vulnerability of Tor circuits in several countries.

- In reality, we dont know where to avoid so can only make educated guesses at the safest routes and choose the best trade-off between performance and acceptable security against realistic threats.

## Unmasking hidden Tor service users is too easy, say infosec bods

- The two suggest an attacker could identify users connections by running rogue HSDir nodes themselves

- To demonstrate, they set up such nodes and then successfully convinced Facebooks hidden service to accept most of them as its HSDir providers.

- you still need control of something on the entry side of the connection before you can identify anyone.

- The researchers have released software tools to help spot dodgy HSDir nodes and they say that a proposed change to the Tor software for hidden services could stop this kind of correlation attack

## Mobile spyware firm mSpy hacked, clients doxxed on dark web

- Mobile spyware firm mSpys database has appeared on the dark web, following an apparent hack on its systems last week. Emails, text messages, payment details, Apple IDs, passwords, photos and location data for mSpyusers have all been exposed, according to investigative reporter Brian Krebs, who broke the story about the apparent  but as yet unconfirmed  breach.

- mSpys technology is sold as a means for parents and employers to surreptitiously snoop on employees or family members, as its corporate blurb (which omits mention of one obvious market  suspicious spouses) explains:  mSpy is the most popular and user-friendly application for watching over your kids, preventing theft and supervising your employees performance.

- Our mobile monitoring software runs invisibly on the target device to track all activity, including call log history, GPS location, calendar updates, text messages, emails, web history and much more.  The firm  which boasts two million users and develops technology for Android, iOS, Windows and Mac PCs  is yet to respond to an El Reg request for comment on the apparent breach. The unknown hackers behind the leak suggest the data dump contains information on more than 400,000 mSpy users to a Tor-based site.

- The use of dark-web hosting is likely to frustrate (or at least delay) any take-down effort. mSpy hardly cuts a sympathetic figure as a victim, but the real victims of the apparent breach are arguably targets of snooping rather than the firm itself. Trey Ford, global security strategist at Metasploit maker Rapid7, commented: People being spied on were having their information stolen by one party, and its now moving rapidly through the underground. Not only is the legality of installing this software questionable (CFAA, etc.

- Corporate executives are effectively information owners, responsible for the data collected, how it is stored and protected, and what to do when something happens, he added.

## Android ransomware poses as FBI smut warning

- Cybercrooks have launched a new wave of Android ransomware that poses as a pretty convincing FBI-imposed porn-surfing warning. Over 15,000 spam emails, including zipped files, have hit the inboxes of Android users in recent days, according to Romanian security software firm Bitdefender.

- Users that try to independently unlock their devices will see the amount increase to $1,500, with payment demanded via Money Pak and PayPal My Cash transfers. The malware poses as an Adobe Flash Player update, a common malware slinging ruse. After pressing OK to continue, users see an FBI warning and cannot escape by navigating away, states Catalin Cosoi, Chief Security Strategist at Bitdefender. The devices home screen delivers an alarming fake message from the FBI telling users they have broken the law by visiting pornographic websites.

- To make the message more compelling, hackers add screenshots of the so-called browsing history.

- The warning gets scarier as it claims to have screenshots of the victims faces and know their location, said Cosoi. Android ransomware demands $500 to restore access  Bitdefender detects the threat as Android Trojan SLocker-DZ.

- This is one of the most prevalent Android ransomware families as the authors regularly create new variants. The malware does not encrypt the contents of compromised smartphones, instead rendering the devices home screen button and back functionalities inoperable. Turning the device on/off doesnt help either, as the malware runs when the operating system boots, according to Cosoi. If ADB (Android Data Bridge) is enabled on the infected Android, users can uninstall the offending application.

## Crypto flaws in Blockchain Android app sent bitcoins to the wrong address

- Blockchain, one of the Internets most widely used Bitcoin wallets, has rushed out an update for its Android app after discovering critical cryptographic and programming flaws that can cause users to send digital coins to the wrong people with no warning.

- versions 4.1 or older of the mobile OS

- most serious of the flaws is the use of the unencrypted HTTP connections

- the apps cryptographic engine contacts random.org to obtain random numbers used to generate private keys for Bitcoin addresses

- random.org has required the use of the more secure HTTPS protocol and has returned a 301 Moved Permanently response when accessed through HTTP

- As a result, vulnerable installations of Blockchain for Android generated the private key corresponding to the address 1Bn9ReEocMG1WEW1qYjuDrdFzEFFDCq43F

- the owner of the lucky 1Bn9ReEocMG1WEW1qYjuDrdFzEFFDCq43F address appears to have received almost 34 bitcoins

- the pseudorandom number generator in Blockchain for Android failed to access random data that was supposed to be mixed into the random bits downloaded from random.org.

## Mozilla Drops $25 Smartphone Plans, Will Focus On Higher Quality Devices

- But now, they've got Bing's teat to suck on. I imagine that eventually people will stop giving Mozilla boatloads of free money and Mozilla will have to figure out a way to function like a real business.

- However, this isn't it: "they've hinted at plans to start supporting Android apps" That will kill Firefox OS faster than anything.

- If Firefox OS runs Android apps then there's no reason for write any Firefox OS apps.

- There already are a gazillion Android apps out there.

- And if you think of something new, and you're already experienced at writing for Android, there's no need to learn how to write for Firefox OS, just keep making Android apps.

## Android Wear Security Analysis - mwrlabs

- Motivated by the rise in popularity of wearable devices, MWR decided to perform a security review of Android Wear running on the LG G watch.

- private ServiceConnection connection = new ServiceConnection() { public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName className, IBinder iservice) { Log.d(TAG, "onServiceConnected: " + className.getClassName); } public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName className) { Log.d(TAG, "onServiceDisconnected"); } } bindService is an asynchronous method, the second argument to which is an object containing methods which will be called when the service is available.

- According to Google2: The Android SDK tools generate an interface in the Java programming language, based on your .aidl file.

- onTransact takes several arguments, an integer representing which method to call, along with Parcel objects containing data.

- This means the security check will fail if the UID does not belong to the package name specified and a security exception will occur. Conclusion This research aimed to discover how Android Wear applications communicate and whether there are controls in place which stop non-privileged malware from delivering messages to arbitrary applications.

## Flawed Android factory reset leaves crypto and login keys ripe for picking

- An estimated 500 million Android phones dont completely wipe data when their factory reset option is run, a weakness that may allow the recovery of login credentials, text messages, e-mails, and contacts, computer scientists said Thursday. In the first comprehensive study of the effectiveness of the Android feature, Cambridge University researchers found that they were able to recover data on a wide range of devices that had run factory reset.

- The function, which is built into Googles Android mobile operating system, is considered a crucial means for wiping confidential data off of devices before theyre sold, recycled, or otherwise retired.

- As a researcher known as Bunnie observed during a presentation at the 2013 Chaos Communication Congress,when using Flash drives, you are not storing data, you are storing a probabilistic approximation of your data. Deleting all of it with certainty, it seems, is exceedingly hard. 30C3: Exploration and Exploitation of an SD Memory Card. The researchers experimentswhich were conducted on second-hand phones obtained from January to May of last yeardidnt test phones running Android versions past 4.3.

- Probably the most effective thing to do with Android devices that offer full-disk encryption is to turn it on and use a randomly generated password that includes numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and symbols, and has a minimum of 11 characters.

- The researchers went on to recommend a variety of technical changes that Google or device manufacturers can make to improve the reliability of Androids factory reset process. Lest antivirus providers attempt to use the findings to promote remote wiping features in their products, the researchers pointed to a separate paper they also published Thursday titled Security Analysis of Consumer-Grade Anti-Theft Solutions Provided by Android Mobile Anti-Virus Apps.

## Andresen Will Shift Efforts to Bitcoin Fork, If No Consensus Reached on Block Size

- f the development community could reach no consensus on increasing the one-megabyte block size limit, he would shift his efforts from the main Bitcoin implementation (Bitcoin core) to the alternative Bitcoin-Xt implementation

- could represent a watershed moment for Bitcoin as a whole

- Bitcoin-Xt is a patch placed on top of Bitcoin core

- he will not settle for 20-megabyte blocks, as he proposed for Bitcoin core

- Andresen will likely push for an additional automatic increase of the limit, possibly by 40% per year

- Satoshi Nakamoto originally intended it to be a temporary measure in 2011 to prevent spam

## Bitcoin Arrives At NYSE, Startup Aims To Tackle Micropayments and Easy Mining

- First and foremost it is looking like 21 has developed extremely inexpensive and efficient chips to embed in smart devices which will have a very nominal power usage and only mine a few satoshi's per hour for the sake of profiting off of IoT services and not primarily off the value of the mined bitcoins themselves. 1) Allowing for micropayments for services, sites and products where the user doesn't even need to signup for a service or provide a credit card. 2) More secure authentication which depends upon the security of the very secure blockchain instead of any built in software.

- This will be completely transparent to the user as they just need to use 1 satoshi and than they can have the ability to use trustless escrow or smart contracts on the blockchain.The intention here is to make bitcoin useful without the user even knowing about it or having to purchase any. 3) Free SAAS services which depend upon the bitcoins being mined. 4) The ability to pay for and resell bandwidth, where routers and cell phones may become part of a decentralized Small Cell network - https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com] This is likely why Qualcomm is invested. 5) Reducing the costs of devices by subsiding a bit of the upfront costs with SaaS, mining reward, and BTC tx fees all possible with adding a mining chip. One good consequence will be in the reversal of the trend of the centralization of mining and the further strengthening of bitcoin.

- I expect other companies like google, MSFT, AMD, IBM, ect... to form partnerships and start to develop their own competing chips which may use bitcoin or another alt.
