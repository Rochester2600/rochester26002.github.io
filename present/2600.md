## Anonymous No More: Your Coding Style Can Give You Away

- University of Goettingen, and Princeton have developed a "code stylometry" that uses natural language processing and machine learning to determine the authors of source code based on coding style

- averaging 630 lines of code per author their code stylometry achieved 95% accuracy in identifying the author of anonymous code

## Silk Road trial closes: Its a hacker! Its a virus! Its ludicrous.

- A federal jury saw a final clash between prosecutors and lawyers for Ross Ulbricht on Tuesday as the Silk Road drug-trafficking trial sped to a close.

- suggested again that Ulbricht left the site behind but came back

- Ulbrichts own lawyer admitted during opening statements that his client created the site. Theres no dispute it was used to sell drugs, said Turner. Theres no dispute when the defendant was arrested, he was logged in as Dread Pirate Roberts.

- bookkeeping spreadsheets. The to-do lists. The weekly reports. The maintenance logs. The chatsmore than 1,000 pages of chats with Variety Jones, his hacker-mentor.

- Dread Pirate Roberts and Ulbricht cant be the same person, in part because Ulbricht just didnt have the sophistication and cunning that DPR exhibited, said Dratel.

- An entire copy of the Silk Road site was found, encrypted, on a thumb drive on Ulbrichts bedside table. Would Dread Pirate Roberts do that? he asked.

- Would DPR have saved his chats? Even Ulbrichts position in the library, with his back to the door, was a move Dread Pirate Roberts wouldnt have made, said Dratel.

- Keeping a journal like that? he asked. Does that sound like DPR? Its a little too convenient. Its like a virtuoso piano player who cant play Happy Birthday. It doesnt fit.

## Silk Road Case: Prosecution Reads Alleged Transcript of DPR Arranging 5 Murders

- The prosecution has now rested its case

- ne of their last presentations was a series of communications between DPR and a supposed member of the Hell's Angels motorcycle club

- he arranged for hitmen to kill five different people.

- Dread Pirate Roberts, hasn't been charged with murder-for-hire in his Southern District of New York case

- He does, however, face murder-for-hire charges in a separate case in Baltimore

- members of the Hell's Angels organization are familiar with using encryption to shield their communications from law enforcement

## [ooni-dev] Timeline of Tor blocking

- Tor's site was blocked in Turkey in March 2014: http://cartography.io/

- "Iran  2013  TCP reset on all non-HTTP"

- a traffic shaping behavior that matched TCP connections
against a whitelist (HTTP or HTTPS)

- if the connection did not match this
behavior, then the throughput was throttled down to 1 packet per second
after sixty seconds

- Psiphon's bypass mechanism was to prepend "GET /
HTTP1.0" in front of traffic streams.

## The NSA Is Viewed Favorably By Most Young People

- poll by the Pew Research Center suggests that Snowden's revelations have not much changed the public's favorable view of the NSA.

- Younger people (under 30) tend to view the NSA favorably

- compared to those 65 and older. 61% of people aged 18-29 viewed the NSA favorably,

- 30% viewed the NSA unfavorably and 9% had no opinion

- 55% of people aged 30-49 viewed the NSA favorably.

- At the 65+ age bracket, only 40% of people viewed the NSA favorably.

## Subconscious Keys

- We present a defense against coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology

- Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern

- We use a carefully crafted computer game to plant a secret password in the participants brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password

- the participant cannot be coerced into revealing it since he or she has no conscious knowledge of it

## Trouble comes in threes: Yet ANOTHER Flash 0-day vuln patch looming

- Adobe Flash Player 16.0.0.296 and earlier versions for Windows and Macintosh, 13.0.0.264 and earlier 13.x versions, as well as Adobe Flash Player 11.2.202.440 and earlier versions for Linux will all need updating

## The Pirate Bay Is Back Online, Properly

- Sometime around a week ago, the waving pirate flag video changed to a graphic of an orange phoenix, and a disabled search box showed up. I've been watching the site since, and now, about 12 hours before the timer was to reach zero, the site is back up, complete with searches

## GHOST Vulnerability In glibc  Everything You Need To Know

- glibc which under certain circumstances can allow remote code execution

- Heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18

- allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) gethostbyname or (2) gethostbyname2 function, aka GHOST.

## Samsung Set To Launch Mobile Payment System With Galaxy S6 At MWC

- Samsung will introduce the Galaxy S6 on Sunday, March 1st

- Korean giant will also introduce its version of a global mobile payment system

- which will likely have the moniker "Samsung Pay."

- Samsung can't afford to give away its position in the smartphone market, and a payments system tailored to customers is a key factor

## Malicious Google Play apps (may have) hosed millions of Android handsets

- Security researchers have once again found Google Play offering malicious apps that have been downloaded by millions of Android users

- When you install Durak, it seems to be a completely normal and well working gaming app

- . After a week, you might start to feel there is something wrong with your device

- Each time you unlock your device an ad is presented to you, warning you about a problem, e.g. that your device is infected, out of date or full of porn

- You are then asked to take action, however, if you approve you get re-directed to harmful threats on fake pages, like dubious app stores and apps that attempt to send premium SMS behind your back or to apps that simply collect too much of your data for comfort while offering you no additional value.

- Update: About six hours after this post went live, a Google spokeswoman e-mailed to say the three apps have been pulled from Play.
