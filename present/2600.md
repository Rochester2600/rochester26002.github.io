## tor-control protocol for rapidly switching circuits / new exit node to your tor instance

-  Playing with the Tor control protocol in node

- tor-control Most of this example is done with sample code from showing how to use this module.

- The fun part was making it work with NW.js for a button :) Tor control protocol specification

- create GUI tool for OS X, Linux, and Windows Set timer so that every n interval the circuit is rotated button for manaully switching circuit / getting new identity button for stopping TOR 

- I made a simple nw.js app just to test the concept of making an application that would allow you to control the onion router and request a new exit node / identity.

## Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about libreboot

- extremely unlikely that any post-2008 Intel hardware will ever be supported in libreboot, due to severe security and freedom issues; so severe, that the libreboot project recommends avoiding all modern Intel hardware. If you have an Intel based system affected by the problems described below, then you should get rid of it as soon as possible

- ME is present on all Intel desktop, mobile (laptop), and server systems since mid 2006.

- direct memory access (DMA) engine to access the host operating system's memory

- (DAL), which consists of a Java virtual machine and set of pre-installed Java classes for cryptography, secure storage, etc

- The AMT application itself has known vulnerabilities, which have been exploited to develop rootkits and keyloggers

- It's possible that rootkits could be implemented there, which could perform a number of attacks on the user (the list is endless). Any Intel system that has the proprietary FSP blob cannot be trusted at all

- Basically, all Intel hardware from year 2010 and beyond will never be supported by libreboot. The libreboot project is actively ignoring all modern Intel hardware at this point, and focusing on alternative platforms.

## KARMA POLICE: GCHQ spooks spied on every web user ever  The Register

- New documents revealing GCHQs mass-surveillance activities have detailed an operation codenamed KARMA POLICE, which slurped up the details of every visible user on the Internet.

- explicit intention of correlating every user visible to passive SIGINT with every website they visit, hence providing either (a) a web browsing profile for every visible user on the Internet, or (b) a user profile for every visible website on the Internet.

- tracking of those who have visited spook-baiting Cryptome.org, and pornography site RedTube.

- One user was targeted, without any stated suspicion of being involved in terrorism or posing a threat to national security, and was found to have visited popular porn purveyor Redtube, as well as social media sites and several Arabic and Islamic sites, which appeared to be commercial enterprises.

## Profiled: From Radio to Porn, British Spies Track Web Users Online Identities

- One system builds profiles showing peoples web browsing histories

- er analyzes instant messenger communications, emails, Skype calls, text messages, cell phone locations, and social media interactions. Separate programs were built to keep tabs on suspicious Google searches and usage of Google Maps.

- They zeroed in on any stations found broadcasting recitations from the Quran, such as a popular Iraqi radio station and a station playing sermons from a prominent Egyptian imam named Sheikh Muhammad Jebril. They then used KARMA POLICE to find out more about these stations listeners, identifying them as users on Skype, Yahoo, and Facebook.

## Keybase's New Key Model

- Glory! So what's wrong? While this is a great answer for identity, key management is still dirty.  as a user, you must get your PGP private key to all your devices you're in trouble if you lose a device or fear it has been compromised PGP is too complicated for most people  A solution is in the works The Keybase directory now supports device-specific NaCl keys.

- From now on, an identity on Keybase can be constructed like this:   here we see a user with 2 computers and 3 keys she can prove her identity with any key, and the keys are connected Establishing keys  devices Soon, Keybase will release open-source apps for:  iPhone  Android OSX, Linux,  Windows (with nice GUIs and CLI)  When you install the Keybase app, it will feel like any other app.

- Slightly cumbersome, these are full NaCl keys that can be used to provision a new computer. An example: death punch correct staple battery horse clearly cherry picked words yeah moo car lisp  You can put that in your wallet or stick it in a drawer.

- In the above example, the first 2 words ("death punch") are a public label, and the rest encodes the private key.   here we see a user with 4 computers (2 are mobile) and 6 keys; she even used her paper key to provision a device! the important thing is that she is herself, the sum of all her proofs, on any device Paper keys, like devices, must be publicly announced and are publicly removed. Future goals In the long run, we hope to bring a number of solutions, fully cross-platform:  safer publishing of signed, unencrypted data (such as source code and binaries) safer end-to-end file encryption  sharing (both for your own data, and for your collaborations) easier security/identity for other apps that use keys, such as SSH, bitcoin, and other communication apps. easier private chatting  That's vague, but we'll have a more specific announcement (especially on 1 and 2) in the next 3-4 months.

- In the meantime, we're getting all our ducks in a row. Testing it This new key model is available for testing. If you'd like to poke around, you can download a command-line-only version of Keybase's new client for OSX or Linux and hit one of our staging servers with test accounts.

## Microsoft Has Built a Linux Distro

- jbernardo writes: Microsoft has built a Linux distro, and is using it for their Azure data centers.

- From their blog post: "It is a cross-platform modular operating system for data center networking built on Linux."

- Apparently, the existing SDN (Software Defined Network) implementations didn't fit Microsoft's plans for the ACS (Azure Cloud Switch), so they decided to roll their own infrastructure.

- No explanation why they settled on Linux, though  could it be that there is no Windows variant that would fit the bill?

- In other news, Lucifer has been heard complaining of the sudden cold.

## Yet another pre-installed spyware app discovered on Lenovo computers

-  A factory refurbished Thinkpad shipped with Windows 7 and a scheduler app that ran once a day, collecting usage data about what you do with your computer and exfiltrating it to an analytics company. 

-   The fact that this was taking place was buried deep in the user agreement that came with the machine.  This is the third preloaded spyware scandal to hit Lenovo this year: first it was caught installing Superfish, which grossly compromised user security by installing a man-in-the-middle certificate into the operating system; then it got caught loading immortal, self-reinstalling crapware into part of the BIOS reserved for custom drivers.  This latest scandal is particularly noteworthy because it impinges on Thinkpads, the rock-solid laptop brand the company acquired from IBM.  As Ive noted before, Im a Lenovo Thinkpad user and none of this affects me because I throw away the hard drives that come with my laptops and install Ubuntu GNU/Linux on new SSD hard-drives.

- According to the description in the task scheduler: This task uploads Customer Feedback Program data to Lenovo.  I have setup my fair share of new Lenovo machines and cant recall ever being asked about a Customer Feedback program.  The program that runs daily is Lenovo.TVT.CustomerFeedback.Agent.exe and it resides in folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Lenovo\Customer Feedback Program.  Other files in this folder are Lenovo.TVT.CustomerFeedback.Agent.exe.config, Lenovo.TVT.CustomerFeedback.InnovApps.dll and Lenovo.TVT.CustomerFeedback.OmnitureSiteCatalyst.dll.  According to Wikipedia, Omniture is an online marketing and web analytics firm, and SiteCatalyst (since renamed) is their software as a service application for client-side web analytics.  So, while there may not be extra ads on ThinkPads, there is some monitoring and tracking.  On the one hand this is surprising because the machines were refurbished and sold by IBM.

## Crash Google Chrome with one tiny URL: We cram a probe in this bug

- You can crash the latest version of Google Chrome with a simple tiny URL. Just rolling your mouse over it in a page, launching it from another app such as an email client, or pasting it into the address bar, will kill either that tab or the whole browser. Its perfect for pranking friends by sending it to them in emails and messages. The flaw was spotted just before the weekend by a chap called Andris Atteka, who blogged about the programming blunder here, and filed a bug report here.  This crashes someones browser in web gtalk/chrome if you msg them that URL https://t.co/vi0e10IEFH  mdowd (@mdowd) September 20, 2015 Below is a screenshot of two forms of the offending URL  we wont put them this article as-is, because they will crash your tab if you accidentally wander your pointer over them in Chrome.

- And thats not nice. Weve tested it on Chrome 45.0.2454.93 on OS X El Capitan and Windows 10, and both flavors of the browser are vulnerable.

- Chromebooks and Linux flavors of the browser are also crashed by the URL, plus Opera 32.0 which is based on Chromium 45, were told.

- Thanks Google. Whats cool about this bug is that it triggers a fatal exception (a SIGTRAP) rather than the usual memory access violation error caused by an overrun buffer, heap corruption, or similar  even in released code.

- But the URL is invalid, which is unexpected, and so the function hits a DCHECK() that causes the software to bail out  even on the release build.

## Apple scrambles after 40 malicious XcodeGhost apps haunt App Store

- PhotoAtelierApple officials are cleaning up the companys App Store after a security firm reported that almost 40 iOS apps contained malicious code that made iPhones and iPads part of a botnet that stole potentially sensitive user information. The 39 affected appswhich included version 6.2.5 of the popular WeChat for iOS, CamScanner, and Chinese versions of Angry Birds 2may have been downloaded by hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users, security researchers said.

- The programs were infected by a tampered version of Apples legitimate iOS and OS X app development tool called Xcode.

- Researchers from mobile security firm Lookout independently analyzed the same apps and on Sunday issued a blog post that read in part: XcodeGhost is an example of compiler malware.

- Apple has never said exactly what types of vetting it carries out to ensure that App Store titles are safe and securely designed.

- Once the company fully recovers from this incident, the episode would be a great opportunity for officials to be more specific about exactly how it goes about scrutinizing apps and what it will be doing differently in the future to catch mass infections like this one. Post updated to add details about Gatekeeper, figure from Qihoo360 Technology.

## Symantec employees fired for issuing rogue HTTPS certificate for Google

- Symantec has fired an undisclosed number of employees after they were caught issuing unauthorized cryptographic certificates that made it possible to impersonate HTTPS-protected Google webpages.

- We learned on Wednesday that a small number of test certificates were inappropriately issued internally this week for three domains during product testing, Symantec officials wrote in a blog post published Friday. All of these test certificates and keys were always within our control and were immediately revoked when we discovered the issue. There was no direct impact to any of the domains and never any danger to the Internet.

## Hackers upload bot code to Imgur in 8Chan attack

- A nasty vulnerability in Imgur was used by attackers to hide malicious code in images, commandeer visitors browsers, and hose the 4Chan and 8Chan image boards. Imgur has fixed the hole preventing the upload of malicious images, and says the compromised pages were served in targeted attacks and not published to the sites main gallery page.

- The attack planted JavaScript in victims local storage that sent a ping to the attackers command and control servers whenever 8Chan was visited. Compromised images were posted to 4Chan and a related Reddit subreddit page. The attackers intent is unknown and the command and control server is not known to have issued commands to infected machines. Imgur has restricted its servers to hosting only valid image files and nixed the ability to serve JavaScript. Yesterday a vulnerability was discovered that made it possible to inject malicious code into an image link on Imgur, Imgur community director Sarah Schaaf says. From our teams analysis, it appears the exploit was targeted specifically to users of 4chan and 8chan via images shared to a specific sub-reddit on Reddit.com using Imgurs image hosting and sharing tools. The vulnerability was patched yesterday evening and were no longer serving affected images, but as a precaution we recommend that you clear your browsing data, cookies, and localstorage. Reddit users say the attackers JavaScript created an off-screen iframe and embedded a flash file that ran alongside Imgurs other Flash components making the attack less suspicious. This flash file injected more JavaScript into the page [which looked] like an innocuous Pikachu animation, one Reddit user says. This JavaScript was stored to the users localstorage which, since the iframe was pointing at 8chan, allowed the attacker to attach JavaScript to 8chans localstorage.

- So far no one has been able to see a response from that web service, meaning it likely wasnt activated yet or has already been deactivated.

- The outcome is that every time a user visited an 8chan page, it would phone home to check for instructions and then execute more JavaScript code. The attacks were reported on various 4Chan boards. Imgur says it will release more information as it comes to hand.

## Child abuse, drug sales, terrorism fears: Why cops halted a library's Tor relay ... for a month

- PDF Librarians in New Hampshire, America, were warned that running a Tor exit relay on their network would assist child abusers, drug dealers, and terrorists. Those are the remarkable facts that have emerged from a freedom-of-information request filed over the decision by Kilton Library in Lebanon, NH, to host, then take down, and then restore an exit relay of the anonymizing service in their small town.

- The documents [PDF] also show the level of attention being paid to the anonymizing service. After a special agent at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in Boston, Gregory Squire, noticed a newspaper article about Kilton Librarys decision to install a relay for The Onion Router service, he emailed a colleague nearby in Portsmouth complaining: Just terrific  that kid seems to be thinking just an inch past the end of her nose. He was referring to Alison Macrina, founder of the Library Freedom Project, who was trying to persuade libraries across the US to add to the current 1,000 exit nodes that exist in the Tor system, and so make its anonymous service more robust. Where Tor advocates see the system as allowing people to communicate without fear of surveillance, such as journalists and whistleblowers, or NGOs in countries that monitor communications, Homeland Security sees nothing but an opportunity for criminals to try to hide their actions. Trail The person who received the email, the commander of New Hampshires Internet Crime Against Children Task Force, Thomas Grella, then contacted Sergeant Richard Norris at the Lebanon local police station.

- We spoke about how the anonymity of the service would make it very difficult to track people engaged in criminal activity, such as child pornography, drug transactions, and terrorism.

- Id rather vote for the good because there is value to this. According to Macrina, since the decision was made and following press interest in the saga, more than a dozen other libraries have inquired about adding their own Tor relay.

- They are prepared to recall the very worst aspects of human nature to persuade people not to embrace it. It is, of course, a supreme irony that the Tor project is partly funded by the US government.

## Chinese ad firm pwns Android users, creates hijackable global botnet

- A Chinese advertising company has infected and completely hijacked likely hundreds of thousands of Android handsets with an attack so careless it exposes a global botnet to easy hijacking and opens handsets to total compromise by any malware. FireEye (yet again, these guys need to get some sleep) researchers Yulong Zhang, Zhaofeng Chen, and Yong Kang say Chinese marketing company Xinyinhe which promotes itself as a big player in the app advertising game is behind the attack.

- They didnt tag the number of infected devices, but Xinyinhe claims to have customers in 50 countries and be valued as of November at $100 million after it received some $20 million in seed funding in 2013. FireEye has been asked for the number of infected victims. The trio say the attack builds its network of customers by tricking them to install malware that gains root access on some 308 different handsets running virtually all versions of the Android operating system from Gingerbread (2.3.4) to the lastest stable Lollipop (5.1.1) build. These victims are enslaved into a very large global botnet that, incredibly, uses plain text for command and control communications allowing anyone to hijack it. 

- Infection process  Once infected the malware will install legitimate but booby trapped applications without user consent, automatically clicking installation and permission warning prompts. It installs a backdoor and maintains persistence on devices, and opens its attack vector to compromise by third party malware. Xinyinhe cannot be reached for comment as it has taken down its site and another linked to the malware.

- An overview of the malicious adware workflow.  Any affected user may have inadvertently compromised their user credentials for some online services [and should] change their passwords for any online services such as iTunes, online banking, email, and work accounts. The trio says the attackers are so careless that the infected app which have full control root access to phones will allow anyone malware share that priveleged access. This means writers of less harmful malware could take advantage of the infections to gain root privilege, hijack the devices, and inflict permanent damages. So far some 300 infected apps have been discovered including the popular Amazon, Memory Booster, and Clean Master. 

- World infection map  The adware uses novel and impressive techniques for persistence and obfuscation such as installing system level services, and modifying the boot recovery script used to flash new operating system ROMs. Zhang, Chen, and Kang say attackers have repackaged the popular apps with malicious logic that is continuously updated. The most recent samples sport more powerful obfuscation and packing mechanisms. Additional technical information is available in FireEyes analysis.

## iOS 9 security blooper lets you BYPASS PINs, eye up photos, contacts

- A security flaw in iOS 9 allows anyone who has a locked Apple iThing in their hand to view its contacts and photos without having to enter a passcode.

- In the video, Rodriguez enters an incorrect password multiple times, then asks Siri for the time. When the voice-controlled assistant displays the time, youre able to use the Search and Share functions on the iOS clock feature. This, in turn, lets you pull up the iGadget owners contacts, messages, and photos via the Share screen, all without the need to enter a correct PIN.

## Russian biz talks the Tor but can't walk the walk: Effort to wreck network takes bizarre turn

- The Russian governments plan to unmask citizens who use the anonymizing network Tor has hit a snag: the company hired to do the job is trying to wriggle out of its contract. In July 2014, the Russian Interior Ministry advertised for a firm to study the possibility of obtaining technical information about users (user equipment) TOR anonymous network. The price offered was 3,900,000 roubles (US$59,000 or 38,700).

- The US government and others have spent much more than that building and sponsoring the Tor network, and plenty of intelligence agencies would pay a lot more for access to the data running over the anonymized network. Nevertheless, the Central Research Institute of Economics, Informatics and Control Systems, a subsidiary of state-run high-tech goods manufacturer Rostec, took up the challenge.

- But it now appears to be trying to get out of the deal. Bloomberg notes that, bafflingly, Rostec has paid $150,000 to secure the services of Russian law firm Pleshakov, Ushkalov and Partners, with a brief to work on extricating Central Research from its contract with President Putins government. Thats not going to go down well with the Kremlin.

- The Russian government isnt a big fan of internet freedom, and use of Tor within its borders is on the rise as internet users seek a little privacy in the face of draconian censorship laws implemented by Putins cronies. So far, it seems, Tor remains secure.

## XCodeGhost iOS infection toll rises from 39 to a WHOPPING 4,000 apps

- The number of XCodeGhost-infected iOS apps, initially pegged at 39, has ballooned to more than 4,000. The staggering increase was the handiwork of analysis by FireEye researchers who said that the apps were being hosted on the official Apple App Store.

- Immediately after learning of XcodeGhost, FireEye Labs identified more than 4,000 infected apps on the App Store, FireEye said.  The malicious apps steal device and user information and send stolen data to a command and control (CnC) server [and] also accept remote commands including the ability to open URLs sent by the CnC server.

- These URLs can be phishing webpages for stealing credentials, or a link to an enterprise-signed malicious app that can be installed on non-jailbroken devices.  A FireEye spokesman told Vulture South that many of the infected apps were owned by big Chinese global brands such as consumer electronics, telcos, and banks. The Register has asked FireEye for the names of some of the prominent affected apps and will update this story should the information come to hand. FireEye put the huge increase in the number of discovered apps to fast scanning by its mobile threat prevention platform. Apple has continued to exorcise the App Store of malicious apps uploaded in what has been widely considered to be Cupertinos first big malware attack. The apps were infected after developers downloaded a copy of the Xcode iOS development tool through a file-sharing service.

- That package was modified to trojanise apps in a way that passed App Store security checks, and was advertised on popular developer forums as a faster source to download the 3Gb Xcode file. The success of the XCodeGhost phish is staggering; that some 4,000 apps were hosed indicates that a lot of developers were sucked into what must have been a very well-executed attack by highly capable malefactors. Veracode principal solutions architect John Smith said that the attack challenged the notion that iOS was safer than Android. In recent years it has seemed that the problem of mobile malware was bigger for Android than for iOS, Smith said. The more rigorous testing regime required before an iOS app can be published has always been considered to be the reason for this difference, but in this case it seems to have fallen short.

## Learning more about the GFW's active probing system

- This system was brought to life several years ago to reactively probe and block circumvention proxies, including Tor.

- You might remember an earlier blog post that gave us some first insight into how the active probing system works.

- Sometimes, network security equipment goes into "fail open" mode while it updates its rule set, but it is not clear if this is happening here.    We were able to find patterns in the TCP headers of active probes that suggest that all these thousands of IP addresses are, in fact, controlled by a single source.

- ScrambleSuit and its successor, obfs4, defend against probing attacks by relying on a shared secret that is distributed out of band.

- Meek tunnels traffic over cloud infrastructure, which does not prevent active probing, but greatly increases collateral damage when blocked.

## Mapping How Tors Anonymity Network Spread Around the World

- But as the anonymity software Tor approaches its tenth year online, its grown into a powerful, deeply-rooted privacy network overlaid across the internet.

- And a new real-time map of that network illustrates just how widespread and global that network has become. On Friday, freelance Sydney-based coder Luke Millanta launched Onionview, a web-based project that counts and tracks the geographic location of Tor nodes, the volunteer computers that bounce encrypted traffic around the web to offer Tor users anonymity.

- Thats what 6,000 nodes around the world looks like. Millantas map also makes it possible to compare which countries host the largest chunks of the Tor network.

- Despite Tors origins as a research project at the US Navy and later at MIT, privacy-loving Germany has overtaken the US in total nodes, with France, the Netherlands, and Russia coming close behind.

- Even in 2012, Snowdens leaked NSA documents showed that the agency was having trouble identifying Tor users.

## Bitcoin is not anonymous - Elliptic

- On day nine of the trial of Ross Ulbricht, the prosecution called their key witness: Ilhwan Yum, an FBI special agent and cyber security expert

- FBI Agent Yums testimony provided a clear and high-profile illustration of what those with a technical understanding of the digital currency already knew  that bitcoin transactions are anything but anonymous

- Yum provided the smoking gun in the form of incontrovertible proof that over a 12-month period, more than 700,000 bitcoins had been transferred from the Silk Road bitcoin wallet directly to a wallet on Ross Ulbrichts laptop

- So bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous

- Bitcoin therefore provides the ultimate paper trail for law enforcement agencies, tax authorities and compliance professionals

## Smartphone passcodes protected by the Fifth Amendment  US court

- The Feds cant make suspects give up their company-issued smartphone passcodes because doing so violates the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution. So ruled Judge Mark Kearney of the federal court in East Pennsylvania in the case of Securities and Exchange Commission v Huang, an insider-trading case brought against two ex-Capital One bank workers.

- The two ex-analysts are accused of using the financial institutions internal records to make stock market bets on as many as 170 companies, which turned a $150,000 stake into $2.8m of investments. Capital One gave the two staffers smartphones but, as a security measure, let them pick the passcodes themselves.

- When the duo were fired by their bosses they handed back the mobiles, which the SEC  Americas financial watchdog  wants to access to check for evidence. The Pennsylvania court ruled on Wednesday that forcing the pair to unlock the passcode-protected devices would violate their constitutional rights  specifically the Fifth Amendment, which spells out the right against self-incrimination. We find, as the SEC is not seeking business records but defendants personal thought processes, defendants may properly invoke their Fifth Amendment right, the judge wrote in his analysis [PDF]. Absent waiver of the confidentiality attendant to this personal thought process, we cannot find the personal passcodes to the Banks smartphones to be corporate records falling under the collective entity cases.

- Since theres no way for the SEC to prove that incriminating documents are on the handsets, the agency cant force defendants to hand over their codes. Oddly enough, this wouldnt be an issue if the smartphones in question used a fingerprint access system, rather than a passcode.

- A passcode is a thought process, which does get Fifth Amendment protection, whereas a biometric identifier is out in the open. The SEC is bound to appeal the case and go to a higher court on this one.

## People Who Need to Pee Are Better at Lying

- Abstract: The Inhibitory-Spillover-Effect (ISE) on a deception task was investigated.

- Deceiving requires increased access to inhibitory control.

- Participants drank small (low-control) or large (high-control) amounts of water.

- Third-party observers assessed the presence of behavioral cues and made true/lie judgments.

- In the high-control, but not the low-control condition, liars displayed significantly fewer behavioral cues to deception, more behavioral cues signaling truth, and provided longer and more complex accounts than truth-tellers.

## The CIA Campaign to Steal Apple's Secrets

- Researchers also claimed the modified Xcode could force all iOS applications to send embedded data to a listening post. It remains unclear how intelligence agencies would get developers to use the poisoned version of Xcode. Researchers also claimed they had successfully modified the OS X updater, a program used to deliver updates to laptop and desktop computers, to install a keylogger. Other presentations at the CIA conference have focused on the products of Apples competitors, including Microsofts BitLocker encryption system, which is used widely on laptop and desktop computers running premium editions of Windows. The revelations that the CIA has waged a secret campaign to defeat the security mechanisms built into Apples devices come as Apple and other tech giants are loudly resisting pressure from senior U.S. and U.K. government officials to weaken the security of their products.

- Perhaps more than any other corporate leader, Apples CEO, Tim Cook, has taken a stand for privacy as a core value, while sharply criticizing the actions of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies. If U.S. products are OK to target, thats news to me, says Matthew Green, a cryptography expert at Johns Hopkins Universitys Information Security Institute.

- If youre looking for a candidate for Big Brother, Lockheed Martin fits the bill. The Apple research is consistent with a much broader secret U.S. government program to analyze secure communications products, both foreign and domestic in order to develop exploitation capabilities against the authentication and encryption schemes, according to the 2013 Congressional Budget Justification.

- But they do shed light on an ongoing campaign aimed at defeating the tech giants efforts to secure its products, and in turn, its customers private data. Spies gonna spy, says Steven Bellovin, a former chief technologist for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and current professor at Columbia University.

- By quietly exploiting these flaws rather than notifying Apple, the U.S. government leaves Apples customers vulnerable to other sophisticated governments. Security experts interviewed by The Intercept point out that the SMURF capabilities were already available to U.S. and British intelligence agencies five years ago.

## Is Web Crypto Really Doomed? I bet $100!

- Heres a simple Ephemeral Origins technique that can solve this problem step by step.   Appcache all the things and add /a.appcache file itself to the manifest.   Setup DNS record for wildcard subdomains.   Create a simple endpoint wallet.sakurity.com that redirects to wallet-zcyxgphpp57.sakurity.com where zcyxgphpp57 is randomly generated ephemeral origin.

- There will be no 3rd party scripts, everything is self hosted and appcached. 3) Browser extensions, cool timing attacks and other SOP bypasses?

- They compromise all your web pages and cookies anyway. In other words you still shouldnt chat about your ISIS recruitment over yet another in-browser end-2-end chat, or store thousands of Bitcoins in localStorage (even if I told you to), but for apps that alone are not more sensitive than all your web accounts hacked altogether (ToDo lists, password managers on steroids, MEGA-like uploaders or casual emails) ephemeral origins can be quite useful. Thats why web crypto is doable, and not doomed.

- If you find a way how to read localStorage of that origin afterwards, when the service goes malicious, I will pay you modest $100 in BTC :) The exploit must work in all modern browsers (do not use shady ServiceWorkers, they break web too much) Phishing doesnt count, the user remembers wallet-d0svb8pr2 and wont type credentials on looking-new origin.

- Email homakov@gmail.com UPDATE after giving it a second thought and discussion with @joernchen, I think number of threats is too high, even though silent attack is not possible, and no one should use it yet.

## How Is the NSA Breaking So Much Crypto?

- If a client and server are speaking Diffie-Hellman, they first need to agree on a large prime number with a particular form. There seemed to be no reason why everyone couldn't just use the same prime, and, in fact, many applications tend to use standardized or hard-coded primes. But there was a very important detail that got lost in translation between the mathematicians and the practitioners: an adversary can perform a single enormous computation to "crack" a particular prime, then easily break any individual connection that uses that prime.

## University of Cambridge study finds 87% of Android devices are insecure

- After the participants opted into the survey, theUniversity says it collected dailyAndroid version and build number informationfrom over20,400 devices.

- Each individual device was then labeled secure or insecure based on whether or not its OS version was patched against these vulnerabilities or placed in a special maybe secure category if it could have gotten a specialized, backported fix. Further ReadingWaiting for Androids inevitable security ArmageddonEditorial: Androids update strategy doesnt scale, and thats recipe for disaster.

- The group states thatthe bottleneck for the delivery of updates in the Android ecosystem rests with the manufacturers, who fail to provide updates to fix critical vulnerabilities.Along with the study, theUniversity of Cambridge is launching AndroidVulnerabilities.org, a site that houses this data and grades OEMs based on their security record.The groupcame up with a 1-10 security rating for OEMs that it calls the FUM score.

- The other issue is probably that thistwo years of updates policythat Google and OEMs have been livingby doesnt match up with reality.

- According to IDC Research, the top fourAndroid OEMs worldwide are Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Lenovo, respectively.

## Half-secure not good enough for Chrome users says Google

- t simply, the Chocolate Factory reckons the difference between insecure and almost secure isnt worth highlighting, so sites with minor errors in HTTPS will simply show as insecure, from Chrome 46 onwards.

## Shocker: Net anarchist builds sneaky 220v USB stick that fries laptops

- Vid An internet mischief maker has built a USB stick that delivers dangerous 220-volt shocks to PCs, destroying them in the process. The USB Killer is the second iteration of a laptop-wrecking device crafted by a Linux and infosec techie nicknamed Dark Purple.

- The first version of the PC-zapping hardware emerged in March, and pumped 110 volts of anarchic fun across motherboards.

- The main feature of the new version of the device is the doubled output voltage, which is 220 volts (strictly speaking, minus 220). The USB zapper looks like any conventional USB stick. The Russian tinkerer says it uses a voltage converter that charges capacitors to 220V when plugged into a machine, drawing the power needed to do this from its victim.

- If the circuitry is not designed to take a large amount of juice, it will fail.

- Doing so with one of these high-voltage charging sticks will send sparks flying across the office, perhaps literally.

## SDR Tutorials From Michael Ossmann

-  If youre just getting into software-defined radio (SDR) but you find some of the math and/or terminology a bit of hurdle, you could absolutely do worse than to check out these SDR tutorials by [Michael Ossmann].

- While theyre aimed at people using his HackRF One tool (which we love), most of the tutorial videos are very generally applicable, and we realized that we hadnt mentioned them explicitly before.

- Shame on us! Ossmann focuses on SDR using the open-source GNURadio Companion GUI tool, which makes implementing a lot of cool SDR techniques as easy as dragging and dropping items into a flow diagram.

- Heck, watch these two even if youre not interested in radio. The newest entry, covering DSP filters includes a great hands-on introduction to finite impulse response (moving average) digital filters.

- We really like the practical, simulation-based approach presented in the video  its just perfect for a quick introduction. So if youre looking for a relatively painless way to get into SDR, grab yourself an RTL-SDR dongle, burn yourself a GNURadio Live DVD, and work through these videos.
