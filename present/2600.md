## Fighting Censorship with ProtonMail Encrypted Email Over Tor - ProtonMail Blog

- As part of our efforts to continue protecting user privacy, we are launching a Tor hidden service to combat censorship and surveillance of ProtonMail users.In the past two years, ProtonMail has grown enormously, especially after the recent US election, and today we are the worlds largest encrypted email service with over 2 million users

- We have come a long way since our user community initially crowdfunded the project

- ProtonMail today is much larger in scope than what was originally envisioned when our founding team met at CERN in 2013.As ProtonMail has evolved, the world has also been changing around us

- Civil liberties have been increasingly restricted in all corners of the globe

- Even Western democracies such as the US have not been immune to this trend, which is most starkly illustrated by the forced enlistment of US tech companies into the US surveillance apparatus

- In fact, we have reached the point where it simply not possible to run a privacy and security focused service in the US or in the UK.At the same time, the stakes are also higher than ever before

- As ProtonMail has grown, we have become increasingly aware of our role as a tool for freedom of speech, and in particular for investigative journalism

- Last fall, we were invited to the 2nd Asian Investigative Journalism Conference and were able to get a firsthand look at the importance of tools like ProtonMail in the field.Recently, more and more countries have begun to take active measures to surveil or restrict access to privacy services, cutting off access to these vital tools

## iPhone hacking biz Cellebrite hacked

-                                 The Israeli company that found fame when it was fingered as a potential source of hacking software used by the FBI to crack open an iPhone has itself been hacked.                In a statement on its website, Cellebrite today admitted that an "external web server" containing the company's license management system had been accessed by an unknown third party

- The company is still investigating the extent of the hack, but it has advised all its customers to change their passwords.                                                                                                        The biz says the database is an old one  it has migrated to a new system  but warned that basic contact information for people that were registered to receive notifications from the company has been accessed

- As much as 900GB of information was taken by hackers, according to Motherboard, whose report earlier today led to Cellebrite's confession in the past hour.                Such a database could prove valuable given Cellebrite's line of work: it specializes in mobile forensics

- In that capacity, the FBI apparently approached it in an effort to crack the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook.                Farook was running version 9 of the iOS mobile software, which encrypted the phone's data and required a four-digit pin to access it

- Too many wrong tries effectively render the phone inoperable

- The FBI decided to use the case to have a very public fight with Apple over its security features, demanding that the iTunes giant give the FBI access to the phone.                Apple refused, stating that it was effectively being told to break its own product, and the impasse became national news, with politicians dragged into the argument

- In the end, in a face-saving exercise, the FBI said it had found a third-party vendor that could access the phone, and backed down from what had by then become a legal challenge.                Although neither the FBI nor Cellebrite ever confirmed the forensics company was the source of the hack, neither denied reports, either

- Whatever biz bypassed the smartphone's security, it received as much as $1m for its troubles

## Donald Trump will take cybersecurity advice from, um, Rudy Giuliani

- The transition team for US president-elect Donald Trump has announced that former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani will advise the incoming administration on how to secure America's digital infrastructure. We're told that the Donald may hold meetings with senior private industry executives with experience in online security.

- "As the use of modern communications and technology has moved forward at unparalleled speed, the necessary defenses have lagged behind," the statement reads. "The president-elect recognizes that this needs immediate attention and input from private sector leaders to help the government plan to make us more secure.

- Mr Giuliani was asked to initiate this process because of his long and very successful government career in law enforcement and his now sixteen years of work providing security solutions in the private sector.

- After retiring as New York City mayor, he helped set up Giuliani Partners LLC, a management consulting and security business.

- As a result, the center, in Building 7 at the WTC, was destroyed in the attacks. When you think about all of the top cybersecurity experts Trump could have picked, Giuliani is a really odd choice.

## Trump's cyber-guru Giuliani runs ancient 'easily hackable website'

-                                 US president-elect Donald Trump's freshly minted cyber-tsar Rudy Giuliani runs a website with a content management system years out of date and potentially utterly hackable.                Former New York City mayor and Donald loyalist Giuliani was today unveiled by Trump's transition team as the future president's cybersecurity adviser  meaning Giuliani will play a crucial role in the defense of America's computer infrastructure.                                                                                                        Giulianisecurity.com, the website for the ex-mayor's eponymous infosec consultancy firm, is powered by a roughly five-year-old build of Joomla! that is packed with vulnerabilities

- Some of those bugs can be potentially exploited by miscreants using basic SQL injection techniques to compromise the server.                This seemingly insecure system also has a surprising number of network ports open  from MySQL and anonymous LDAP to a very out-of-date OpenSSH 4.7 that was released in 2007

- It also runs a rather old version of FreeBSD.                Security gurus are right now tearing strips off Trump's cyber-wizard pick

- Top hacker Dan Tentler was first to point out the severely out-of-date Joomla! install.                "It speaks volumes," Tentler told The Register, referring to Giuliani's computer security credentials, or lack of, and fitness for the top post.                "Seventy-year-old luddite autocrats who often brag about not using technology are somehow put in charge of technology: it's like setting our country on fire and giving every extranational hacker a roman candle  or, rather, not setting on fire, but dousing in gasoline."                Content management system developer Michael Fienen also pulled no punches:                Damning ..

- Web dev Michael Fienen weighs in on Facebook                It gets worse

- "Giuliani is running a version of PHP that was released in 2013, and a version of Joomla that was released around 2012," said Ty Miller, a director at Sydney-based infosec biz Threat Intelligence.                "Using the version information, within minutes we were able to identify a combined list of 41 publicly known vulnerabilities and 19 publicly available exploits

- Depending upon the configuration of the website, these exploits may or may not work, but is an indication that Giuliani's security needs to be taken up a level."                Found on /r/sysadmin, presented without comment

- pic.twitter.com/UmWe7tHURv Ryan Castellucci (@ryancdotorg) January 12, 2017                The most surprising fact in all of this is that the Giuliani Security website hasn't ALREADY been hacked

## NSA-leaking Shadow Brokers lob Molotov cocktail before exiting world stage

-                   Enlarge    Shadow Brokers, the mysterious group that gained international renown when it published hundreds of advanced hacking tools belonging to the National Security Agency, says it's going dark

- But before it does, it's lobbing a Molotov cocktail that's sure to further inflame the US intelligence community.In a farewell message posted Thursday morning, group members said they were deleting their accounts and making an exit after their offers to release their entire cache of NSA hacking tools in exchange for a whopping 10,000 bitcoins (currently valued at more than $8.2 million) were rebuffed

- While they said they would still make good on the offer should the sum be transferred into their electronic wallet, they said there would be no more communications."Despite theories, it always being about bitcoins for TheShadowBrokers," Thursday's post, which wasn't available as this article was going live, stated

- "Free dumps and bullshit political talk was being for marketing attention

- There being no bitcoins in free dumps and giveaways

- You are being disappointed? Nobody is being more disappointed than TheShadowBrokers."The post included 61 Windows-formatted binary files, including executables, dynamic link libraries, and device drivers

- While, according to this analysis, 43 of them were detected by antivirus products from Kaspersky Lab, which in 2015 published a detailed technical expose into the NSA-tied Equation Group, only one of them had previously been uploaded to the Virus Total malware scanning service

- And even then, Virus Total showed that the sample was detected by only 32 of 58 AV products even though it had been uploaded to the service in 2009

## Android tops 2016 vuln list, with 523 bugs

- Of any single product, CVE Details reckons, Android had the most reported vulnerabilities in 2016  but as a vendor, Adobe still tops the list. The analysis is limited by the fact that only vulnerabilities passing through Mitre's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database are counted.

- Even so, with 523 vulnerabilities landing a CVE number in 2016, Android carried nearly double the patch-load of Adobe Flash (which had 266 and was number four on the list). It's worth noting that while Debian Linux (319 CVEs) and Ubuntu Linux (278 CVEs) landed second and third places, many of the CVEs attributed to those OSs will be inherited from third party packages included in the distributions. By vendor, Adobe was the clear winner with 1,383 vulnerabilities, with Microsoft in second place at 1,325, Google third with 695, and Apple fourth at 611. Android had a fairly torrid 2016 in terms of security stories.

- It inherited a TCP snooping bug from the Linux kernel (August); in the same month it emerged that a Qualcomm god mode bug reached production Android devices.

- The year ended with Mountain View patching the briefly-infamous Dirty COW bug. It would, however, be unfair to attribute Android's best in show award solely to it being a buggy mess of insecure software whose patches are only guaranteed to reach Nexus devices. Google does, after all, offer a generous and popular bug bounty scheme, making it an attractive target for white- as well as black-hat attackers.

- The program stretches all the way to US$50,000 if you can manage remote pwnage of TrustZone or Verified Boot. Researchers have clearly lavished extra love on The Chocolate Factory in 2016: in the CVE Details 2015 analysis, the top four vendors were Adobe (1,588), Microsoft (1,466), Apple (1,264) and Redhat (a paltry 576).

## Hackers trigger yet another power outage in Ukraine

-                   EnlargeYellowForester    For the second time in as many years, security researchers have determined that hackers have caused a power outage in Ukraine that left customers without electricity in late December, typically one of the coldest months in that country.The researchers' conclusion, reported by news outlets including Dark Reading, Motherboard, and the BBC, signals yet another troubling escalation in the hacking arena

- A December 2015 attack that caused 225,000 Ukrainians to lose electricity was the first known instance of someone using malware to generate a real-world power outage

- Ukrainian officials have pinned the attack on the Russian government, a claim that's consistent with some evidence collected by private security firms.Now, researchers say a second power outage that struck Ukraine in mid-December was also the result of a computer intrusion and bears many of the same technical hallmarks as the first one

- It was part of a series of malicious hacks that have recently targeted key Ukrainian infrastructure, including the country's rail system server, several government ministries, and a national pension fund

- The attacks started on December 6 and lasted through December 20

- The December 17 power outage was the result of an attack at the Pivnichna substation outside Kiev that began shortly before midnight

- It lasted for about an hour.Demonstration of capabilities"The attack [was] not meant to have any lasting dramatic consequences," Marina Krotofil, a security researcher for Honeywell Industrial Cyber Security Labs, told Motherboard

- "They could do many more things, but obviously they didn't have this as an intent

## WhatsApp Security Vulnerability

- Back in March, Rolf Weber wrote about a potential vulnerability in the WhatsApp protocol that would allow Facebook to defeat perfect forward secrecy by forcibly change users' keys, allowing it -- or more likely, the government -- to eavesdrop on encrypted messages.

- He told the Guardian: "If WhatsApp is asked by a government agency to disclose its messaging records, it can effectively grant access due to the change in keys.

- WhatsApp's implementation automatically resends an undelivered message with a new key without warning the user in advance or giving them the ability to prevent it.

- Any attempt to intercept messages in transmit by the server is detectable by the sender, just like with Signal, PGP, or any other end-to-end encrypted communication system.

- EDITED TO ADD (1/24): Zeynep Tufekci takes the Guardian to task for their reporting on this vulnerability.

## Amateur Scientists Find New Clue In D.B. Cooper Case, Crowdsource Their Investigation

- Six months after the FBI closed the only unsolved air piracy in American aviation history -- after a 45-year investigation -- there's a new clue.

- A band of amateur scientists selected by the Seattle FBI to look for clues in the world's most infamous skyjacking may have found new evidence in the 45-year-old case

- They're asking for the public's help because of new, potential leads that could link DB Cooper to the Puget Sound aerospace industry in the early 1970s

- The scientific team has been analyzing particles removed from the clip-on tie left behind by Cooper after he hijacked a Northwest Orient passenger jet in November 1971

- A powerful electron microscope located more than 100,000 particles on old the JCPenny tie. The team has identified particles like Cerium, Strontium Sulfide, and pure titanium.

- the elements identified were rarely used in 1971, during the time of Cooper's daring leap with a parachute from a passenger jet.

## Promising compsci student sold key-logger, infects 16,000 machines, pleads guilty, faces jail

-                                 A 21-year-old computer science student, who won a Programmer of the Year Award in high school, has admitted selling key-logging malware out of his college dorm room.                On Friday, Zachary Shames, an undergraduate at James Madison University in Virginia, US, pleaded guilty in a federal district court to one count of aiding and abetting computer intrusions

- His plea was accepted by Judge Liam OGrady.                                                                                                        In 2015, Shames made the JMU dean's list

- Now he faces up to 10 years in the clink.                According to the Eastern Virginia district attorney's office, Shames was responsible for developing and selling more than 3,000 copies of a key-logger program called Limitless Logger that was used to infect at least 16,000 machines.                Shames went onto hacker forums to tout his $25 keystroke-logging spyware, which once installed on a victim's computer recorded passwords and other sensitive information

- The malicious code attempted to encrypt itself to hide from antivirus packages, and logged keypresses were siphoned off to a website called limitlessproducts.org.                Shames was eventually snared by FBI agents after selling his software from a PayPal account that was registered in his real name, according to court documents obtained by The Register

- That PayPal account was connected to an email address  hfmephobia@gmail.com  that answered support queries for the malware and was also the contact address for the domain name limitlessproducts.org

- Shames had registered that domain under his real name and home address, too.                An ice hockey fan and one-time country club waiter, Shames built the software nasty while he was in high school, according to the DA's office

- When he graduated from Langley High, in Fairfax, Virginia, he continued to develop and peddle his malware online from his JMU dorm room in Shenandoah Hall

- He was arrested and charged after the Feds, armed with a search warrant, swooped in March 2016.                According to his LinkedIn page, Shames, a 3.7 GPA student of Great Falls, Virginia, worked as an intern at Northrup Grumman from 2015 to August of last year, developing front-end website code and backend Java software and managing a MySQL database

## Visualizing the Dark Web: Dark Market Flower

- I believe the technologies  the people who combine to form it represent something bigger than the constituent parts.

- Every day on Hansa thousands of dollars worth of drugs  other illicit items are traded.

- The transactions, as the latest OnionScan report reveals, can be reconstructed using some simple data analysis.

- I took these transactions and the relationships between the buyers  sellers and with a little bit of math magic formed a flower.

- If you would like to support further research and development of tools like OnionScan you can become a patron at Patreon

## Google floats prototype Key Transparency to tackle secure swap woes

- Google has released an open-source technology dubbed Key Transparency, which is designed to offer an interoperable directory of public encryption keys.

- Existing methods of protecting users against server compromise require users to manually verify recipients' accounts in-person. This simply hasn't worked.

- Key Transparency aims to make the relationship between online personas and public keys "automatically verifiable and publicly auditable" while supporting important user needs such as account recovery

- Early reaction to the project from some independent experts such as Matthew Green, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University, has been positive.

## Google reveals its servers all contain custom security silicon

- We also design custom chips, including a hardware security chip that is currently being deployed on both servers and peripherals.

- These chips allow us to securely identify and authenticate legitimate Google devices at the hardware level

- These signatures can be validated during each boot or update

- We enable hardware encryption support in our hard drives and SSDs and meticulously track each drive through its lifecycle

- We do not rely on internal network segmentation or firewalling as our primary security mechanisms

## Researchers work to save trusted computing apps from keyloggers

- For hypervisors, the paper suggests the seL4 microkernel. Originally developed by Australia's NICTA and now handled by the CSIRO Data61 project, seL4 is a mathematically verified software kernel that was published as open source software in 2014.

- An implementation wouldn't be seamless: the SGXIO paper devices a fair chunk of copy to application design, enclave programming (fortunately something Intel provides resources for), driver design, and hypervisor choice.

- insecure I/O like keyboards or USB provide a vector by which sensitive user data could be compromised.

## Google caps punch-yourself-in-the-face malicious charger hack

- Google has capped a dangerous but somewhat obscure boot mode vulnerability that allowed infected PCs and chargers to put top end Nexus phones into denial of service states.

- Google badged the bug high severity and prevented locked bootloaders from booting into the necessary risky boot modes. Nexus 6 devices were patched in November while 6P devices received the update this month.

- allows infected computers and malicious power chargers to compromise Nexus 6 and 6p phones.

- The vulnerability overcomes the normal requirement that phones already have adb enabled in developer options.

- users in physical control of handsets will need to tap a prompt to authorise adb connectivity with the infected PC or charger for the attacks to work.

## Brother-and-sister duo arrested over hacking campaign targeting Italy's bigwigs

-                                 A hacking operation featuring the EyePyramid trojan successfully compromised the systems of numerous high-profile Italian targets, including two former prime ministers, say Italian police.                High-profile targets were targeted by a spear-phishing campaign that served a remote-access trojan codenamed "EyePyramid" as a malicious attachment.                                                                                                        Targets of the spying included bankers, businessmen and even several cardinals

- The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, and two former Italian prime ministers, Matteo Renzi and Mario Monti, were among targets of the campaign, according to a copy of an Italian arrest warrant obtained by Politico.                The malware was used to successfully exfiltrate over 87 gigabytes worth of data  including usernames, passwords, browsing data, and other files  from compromised systems.                Federico Maggi, a senior threat researcher at Trend Micro, has published a blog post here and in a technical summary (on GitHub) here.                Brother and sister Giulio Occhionero, 45, and Maria Occhionero, 48, were arrested in Rome on Tuesday and detained over hacking and espionage charges related to the EyePyramid campaign, Reuters reports

- Investigators appear to be proceeding on the basis that the hacking operation was used to harvest insider intelligence as part of a criminally tainted investment strategy rather than politically motivated cyber-espionage.                The "stolen data was stored in servers in Prior Lake, Minnesota, and Salt Lake City, Utah," according to a court document seen by Reuters.                The FBI has seized the servers and will ship them to Italy, the head of Italy's cyber crime unit told the news agency.                Hackers behind the spear-phishing campaign used the compromised email accounts of attorneys and associates in several law firms as a platform to launch the second stage of the attacks, targeting businessmen and politicians, according to Trend Micro's Maggi

-                 Bootnote                Grazie molto to Milan-based reader Alex for the heads-up on this interesting case, which is unsurprisingly getting a lot of coverage in the Italian press.

## Twofish Power Analysis Attack

- New paper: "A Simple Power Analysis Attack on the Twofish Key Schedule."

- This shouldn't be a surprise; these attacks are devastating if you don't take steps to mitigate them.

- The general issue is if an attacker has physical control of the computer performing the encryption, it is very hard to secure the encryption inside the computer. I wrote a paper about this back in 1999.

## Forgot your GitHub password? Facebook cooks up spec to reset logins via social network

- Facebook has written and published a open specification that describes how to generate, for each account, a token that can be given to a third-party service

- These tokens can later be used to reactivate the accounts

- Ahead of that public release, Facebook has worked with GitHub on a trial of the system. If someone gets locked out of their GitHub account, the code repository can ask the third-party recovery service  in this case, Facebook  for that person's token

- When the user logs into their profile on the social network, Facebook releases the person's token to GitHub to complete the account recovery.

- Facebook calls this "delegated account recovery"

## Google's Chrome is about to get rather in-your-face about HTTPS

- Chrome security, said that progress on HTTPS adoption was going well  currently over half of the top 100 websites support HTTPS and 44 per cent default to it

- Chrome is being rolled out and as announced, the browser bar icon for non-HTTPS connections has been changed so users get the written warning: Not secure.

- Google is adding a similar warning box to the autocorrect feature on password form pages and sites asking for login pass phrases and credit card details over HTTP.

## Trump's Executive Order Eliminates Privacy Act Protections For Foreigners

- 88855105story Trump's Executive Order Eliminates Privacy Act Protections For Foreigners  (whitehouse.gov)   Long-time Slashdot reader Kernel Kurtz writes: January 28 is supposed to be Data Privacy Day, so it seems fitting in an alternative sort of way that U.S

- President Trump just signed an executive order that eliminates Privacy Act protections for foreigners

- As a non-American, I find it curious that the person who says he wants to bring jobs to America is simply confirming  the post-Snowden belief that America is not a safe place to do business

-  The Privacy Act has been in place since 1974

- But now section 14 of Trump's "Enhancing Public Safety" executive order directs federal agencies to "ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information" to the extent consistent with applicable law.

## Ransomware Locks A Hotel's Guests In Their Rooms

- An anonymous reader writes: A luxury hotel "paid "thousands" in Bitcoin ransom to cybercriminals who hacked into their electronic key system.

- The "furious" hotel manager says it's the third time their electronic system has been attacked, though one local news site reports that "on the fourth attempt the hackers had no chance because the computers had been replaced and the latest security standards integrated, and some networks had been decoupled."

- The 111-year-old hotel is now planning to remove all their electronic locks, and return to old-fashioned door locks with real keys.

- But they're going public to warn other hotels -- some of which they say have also already been hit by ransomware.

- UPDATE:  The hotel's managing director has clarified today that despite press reports, "We were hacked, but nobody was locked in or out" of their rooms.

## Infosec industry to drive machine learning spend surge says analyst

- 

- The information security industry's rush to adopt machine learning will help businesses burn US$96 billion on big data, intelligence, and analytics by 2021, says research house ABI . The report by lead number cruncher Dimitrios Pavlakis claims User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) and "deep learning algorithm designs" will be widely adopted by security companies as they collectively put big data to work detecting threats.  

- The former machine learning technology, UEBA, is correlation on steroids, capable of detecting anomalies that can indicate if staff logins have been compromised and are being tested across the enterprise network. It can learn the activities and services most typical of a user to generate alerts when something anomalous occurs, like login attempts to odd network shares.

- Vendors are buying up across the space including Splunk's buy of Caspida, and Arksight selling Securonix. Antivirus vendors, Pavlakis says, are contributing too.

- Cylance is pushing its fuzzy antimalware capabilities as a something seated in the much attributed but difficult to acquire artificial intelligence space, for example. Additionally," ... the cyber security industry is investing heavily in machine learning in hopes of providing a more dynamic deterrent," Pavlakis says. This will drive machine learning solutions to soon emerge as the new norm beyond Security Information and Event Management, and ultimately displace a large portion of traditional antivirus, heuristics, and signature-based systems within the next five years. Pavlakis says signature-based antivirus will be "absorbed completely" into machine learning technology and agrees with wider analyst predictions that SIEM logging will be cleaved off and woven into UEBA. Vendors including Gurucul; Niara; Splunk; StatusToday; Trudera, and Vectra Networks are wannabe UEBA innovator leaders in a market that counts Deep Instinct and Spark Cognition as entrants bearing feature-agnostic models, deep learning, and natural language processing, he says.

## It might be time to stop using antivirus

- my single biggest impediment to shipping a secure browser

- meddling AV software delayed Win32 Flash sandboxing "for over a year" and that further sandboxing efforts are still on hold due to AV

- The man-in-the-middle nature of antivirus also causes a stream of TLS (transport layer security) errors, says Schuh, which in turn breaks some elements of HTTPS/HSTS.

## VPN on Android means 'Voyeuristic Peeper Network' in many cases

- 82 per cent of the VPN apps requested permission to access sensitive data on the device, such as SMS history.

- 38 per cent of the apps contained some form of malware.

- 16 per cent routed traffic through other devices, rather than a host server.

- 16 per cent use in-path proxies to modify HTML traffic in transit.

- Three of the 283 analysed apps specifically intercept bank, messaging, and social network traffic.

## Google Quietly Makes 'Optional' Web DRM Mandatory In Chrome

-  Google Quietly Makes 'Optional' Web DRM Mandatory In Chrome  (boingboing.net) 

- JustAnotherOldGuy quotes a report from Boing Boing: The World Wide Web Consortium's Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) is a DRM system for web video, being pushed by Netflix, movie studios, and a few broadcasters.

- Some time in the past few days, Google quietly updated Chrome (and derivative browsers like Chromium) so that Widevine (Google's version of EME) can no longer be disabled; it comes switched on and installed in every Chrome instance.

- Because of laws like section 1201 of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (and Canada's Bill C11, and EU implementations of Article 6 of the EUCD), browsers that have DRM in them are risky for security researchers to audit.

- These laws provide both criminal and civil penalties for those who tamper with DRM, even for legal, legitimate purposes, and courts and companies have interpreted this to mean that companies can punish security researchers who reveal defects in their products. Further reading: Boing Boing and Hacker News.

## We don't want to alarm you, but PostScript makes your printer an attack vector

- a bunch of researchers from a German university have found a cross-site printing bug in the ancient PostScript language.

- Linux, *BSD and Mac OS users note: the bug's also exploitable via the popular Common Unix Printing System, CUPS.

- The boffins exploit the Web mechanism Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for this attack, which they've illustrated below.

- HP LaserJet 4200N and 4250N, the OKI MC342dn and the Konica Minolta Bizhub C454e can be exploited to expose passwords;

- Various HP LaserJets can be reset to factory defaults;

- Brother's proprietary PJL printer language is vulnerable to memory access; and

- It's possible to cause physical damage to NVRAM in a number of printers.

## The FBI is Worried Criminals Might Use the Private Cryptocurrency Monero

-  The privacy-focused digital currency monero has captured the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which has expressed concerns over its use among criminals. Joseph Battaglia, a special agent working at the FBIs Cyber Division in New York City, said during an event last week that widespread use of the increasingly popular cryptocurrency might impact the way the agency conducts investigations. Addressing a group of about 150 law students at New York's Fordham University, he said: "There are obviously going to be issues if some of the more difficult to work with cryptocurrencies become popular.

- A fork of the Bytecoin codebase, monero leverages identity-obscuring ring signatures to make it unclear which funds have been sent by whom and to whom. The cryptocurrency saw its price soar in 2016, climbing from about $0.50 at the beginning of the year to about $12, a 2,760% increase. Since 2013, the agency has seen "enormous growth" in the number of cases involving digital currency payments, according to Battaglia.

- Of those, 75% involved bitcoin, he said, though he mentioned litecoin and monero as other cryptocurrencies the agency has encountered thus far. The FBI Cyber Division looks into a diverse range of online criminal activity. In 2015, the agency reported ransomware losses of $18m from a single type of software.

- Since at least last October, the agency has been investigating a $1.3m bitcoin theft tied to the hacking of the Bitfinex exchange. 'Nefarious uses' Battaglias statements came after his "high-level" account of a typical cryptocurrency investigation given at the event, which one of a series of blockchain workshops co-hosted with IBM. Other panelists included Brigid McDermott, vice president of blockchain business development at IBM; Dan Ramsden, a Fordham Business School adjunct professor; and Gregory Xethalis, a partner at law firm Kaye Scholer. Following the event, the special agent said he couldn't provide additional details specifically pertaining to the FBIs investigative techniques surrounding monero when asked by CoinDesk. During the panel, however, Battaglia described the FBI as "a reactionary organization", adding that, instead of trying to predict the direction that cryptocurrency use might go, the agency has adopted a wait-and-see approach. Battaglia concluded: "Were going to look at what catches on, and what becomes mainstream, and then were going to keep an eye on that, because usually not long after that is when you start to see some of the fraud and some of the more nefarious uses of that technology.

## 218,000 private unencrypted AlphaBay dark web messages exposed

- 213SHARESShare on FacebookRedditBuffer                                        Someone has exploited a vulnerability to view 218,000 private unencrypted messages exchanged by users of the AlphaBay dark web marketplace.On 22 January, a hacker who goes by the name "Cipher0007" reposted on Reddit a bulletin published by one of AlphaBay's moderators.In the bulletin, the admin reveals that the attacker found a way to view users' private unencrypted messages:"hello community

- the user /u/Cipher0007 contacted us mods though the mod mail and delivered proof that he is able to read private alphabay messages

- I have verified it by creating two new accounts, sending a message between them, providing the user the message ID and he showed me the content of it

- [sic]"A statement published by AlphaBay on Pastebin clarifies that the hacker found and exploited two vulnerabilities

- The first flaw gave them access to 218,000 private messages that were less than 30 days old, and that involved most members up to ID 2609452

- The second bug gave the attacker access to user IDs and usernames.The dark web forum's admins say they have contacted everyone affected by this breach

- In the meantime, the attacker has been paid for their findings, the loophole has been closed, and it has been determined that compromised users' older messages and Bitcoin addresses are safe.AlphaBay also made a point of reminding users to create a PGP key and encrypt their sensitive communications.Cipher0007 agrees with that assessment and thinks it's good for AlphaBay's users to protect themselves against incidents like this.Even so, the hacker doesn't feel the marketplace comes out of this with its reputation undamaged

- As he explains in his Reddit post:"Users are partially responsible responsible by not encrypting sensitive messages

## Announcing Pipenv

- I wrote a new tool this weekend, called pipenv

- Check it out on GitHub!                                                                                                                                                              Pipenv in action.                                              Pipenv is an experimental project that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world

- It harnesses Pipfile, pip, and virtualenv into one single toolchain

- It features very pretty terminal colors.It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall packages

- The lock command generates a lockfile (Pipfile.lock). FeaturesAutomatically finds your project home, recursively, by looking for a Pipfile.Automatically generates a Pipfile, if one doesn't exist.Automatically generates a Pipfile.lock, if one doesn't exist.Automatically creates a virtualenv in a standard location (project/.venv).Automatically adds packages to a Pipfile when they are installed.Automatically removes packages from a Pipfile when they are un-installed.Also automatically updates pip.The main commands are install, uninstall, and lock, which generates a Pipfile.lock

- These are intended to replace $ pip install usage, as well as manual virtualenv management. Basic ConceptsA virtualenv will automatically be created, when one doesn't exist.When no parameters are passed to install, all packages specified will be installed.When no parameters are passed to uninstall, all packages will be uninstalled.To initialize a Python 3 virtual environment, run $ pipenv --three first.To initialize a Python 2 virtual environment, run $ pipenv --two first.Otherwise, whatever $ which python will be the default. Other Commandsshell will spawn a shell with the virtualenv activated.run will run a given command from the virtualenv, with any arguments forwarded (e.g

- $ pipenv run python).check asserts that PEP 508 requirements are being met by the current environment. Usage$ pipenvUsage: pipenv [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...Options:  --where          Output project home information.  --bare           Minimal output.  --three / --two  Use Python 3/2 when creating virtualenv.  --version        Show the version and exit.  --help           Show this message and exit.Commands:  check      Checks PEP 508 markers provided in Pipfile.  install    Installs a provided package and adds it to...  lock       Generates Pipfile.lock.  run        Spans a command installed into the...  shell      Spans a shell within the virtualenv.  uninstall  Un-installs a provided package and removes it...  update     Updates pip to latest version, uninstalls all...$ pipenv --wherePipfile found at /Users/kennethreitz/repos/kr/pip2/test/Pipfile

## Trump's 'cyber tsar' Giuliani among creds leaked in mass hacks

-                                 Passwords used by Donald Trump's incoming cybersecurity advisor Rudy Giuliani and 13 other top staffers have been leaked in mass hacks, according to a Channel 4 investigation.                Giuliani, incoming national security advisor Lt Gen Michael Flynn and various cabinet members of Trump's administration had their details included in website mega breaches..

- like millions upon millions of others

- This doesn't mean that we (or they) have been hacked and there's no indication that it's their current credentials that have been compromised

- They may have changed their passwords since, for instance, the LinkedIn breach.                                                                                                        "The passwords of the appointees were hacked in mass breaches of websites like LinkedIn, MySpace, and others between 2012 and 2016," as Channel 4 puts it.                An appearance of someone's records in Have I Been Pwned? should not imply that they have been hacked, contrary to Channel 4's breathless headline.                Channel 4 assured us that their investigation went beyond looking at whether known email addresses of prominent Trump administration figures cropped up on Have I Been Pwned?                "Have I Been Pwned? was one of many sources checked," Mike Smith, the reporter behind the scoop told El Reg

- "Many appointees using the same passwords in multiple places, using the simplest passwords in multiple places."                Kyle Wilhoit, senior security researcher at DomainTools, said: "Unfortunately leaks that include identifiable information like emails and passwords are common and in many cases can't be avoided

- In this case, the leaked email address appeared to come from a common social networking site.                "The issue isn't necessarily about the passwords being leaked

- The primary problem is password reuse between a social networking site, and say, some other system that could be deemed operationally important

- All it takes is an attacker to find out their password from a dump, and capitalise on that human error of reuse."                 Bootnote                Thanks to industry veteran Graham Cluley for helping us run a reality check on C4's expose.

## Mozilla wants infosec activism to be the next green movement

-                                 Mozilla has issued a prototype of its first internet health report in a bid to make humans give security and privacy the same level of attention they devote to climate change.                The prototype report details rising breaches affecting healthcare and medical industries but largely serves as a pulpit from which the browser baron and enemy of surveillance can preach privacy.                                                                                                        Mozilla Foundation executive director Mark Surman explains, in a post dubbed "Calling all citizens of the internet", that the web has changed from a digital permaculture in the 1990s to a place where blind users wander about under the gaze of hackers and intelligence agencies.                "When I first fell in love with the internet in the mid-1990s, it was very much a commons that belonged to everyone: a place where anyone online could publish or make anything ... it made me  and countless millions of others  very happy," Surman says                "Similarly, when I read about hackers turning millions of home webcams and video recorders into a botnet army, I wonder whether this precious public resource can remain safe, secure and dependable? Can it survive?                "We have started work on The Internet Health Report at Mozilla for exactly this reason."                Surman says environmentalists faced a similar problem in the 1960s as internet privacy and security advocates do today in that few people outside of specialist circles know of the dangers posed

- "They built a global movement that helped the public understand nerdy topics like the ozone layer and renewable energy, eventually changing laws and sparking a swath of industries committed to green business," he says.                The report reveals countries that lack comprehensive data protection laws, including the United States, African nations, China, and Pakistan.                Secure site browsing has skyrocketed with half of all those on the internet using HTTPS, up 10 per cent in the last 12 months.                It cites a 2015 study revealing that millions of Facebook users do not realise the social network is on the internet in what it indicates as unhealthy digital literacy

- Hello Freedom Hosting II, you have been hacked

- We have a zero tolerance policy to child pornography.  but what we found while searching through your server is more than 50% child porn...

- Moreover you host many scam sites, some of which are evidently run by yourself to cover hosting expenses.

## Dark Web Recruiters Target Insiders and Employees

- According to a report from RedOwl and IntSights, the recruitment of insiders within the Dark Web is active and growing, with forum discussions and insider outreach nearly doubling from 2015 to 2016.

- Sophisticated threat actors use the Dark Web to find and engage insiders to help place malware behind an organizations perimeter security

- The puppet-masters are also able to arm insiders with the tools and knowledge necessary to help steal data and commit fraud, among other acts, and also to cover any tracks.

- he lures are significant. On one forum, the attacker explained the approach to a potential collaborator, indicating that he needs direct access to computers that access accounts and handle wire transfers, and that he offers to pay 7 figures on a weekly basis for continued access.

## Windows DRM Files Used to Decloak Tor Browser Users

- Downloading and trying to open Windows DRM-protected files can deanonymize Tor Browser users and reveal their real IP addresses, security researchers from Hacker House have warned.

- Attacks using DRM-protected multimedia files in Windows have been known since 2005, but until recently, they've only been used to spread malware.

- Hacker House researchers say the cost of properly signing DRM multimedia files ranges around $10,000, a sum that many low-end malware authors aren't willing to pay for such a niche attack.

## Widely used WebEx plugin for Chrome will execute attack codepatch now!

-                   EnlargeTavis Ormandy    The Chrome browser extension for Cisco Systems WebEx communications and collaboration service was just updated to fix a vulnerability that leaves all 20 million users susceptible to drive-by attacks that can be carried out by just about any website they visit.A combination of factors makes the vulnerabilities among the most severe in recent memory

- First, WebEx is largely used in enterprise environments, which typically have the most to lose

- Second, once a vulnerable user visits a site, it's trivial for anyone with control of it to execute malicious code with little sign anything is amiss

- The vulnerability and the resulting patch were disclosed in a blog post published Monday by Tavis Ormandy, a researcher with Google's Project Zero security disclosure service.Martijn Grooten, a security researcher for Virus Bulletin, told Ars:If someone with malicious intentions (Tavis, as per Google's policy, disclosed this responsibly) had discovered this, it could have been a goldmine for exploit kits

- Not only is 20 million users a large enough number to make it worthwhile in opportunistic attacks, I assume people running WebEx are more likely to be corporate users

- Imagine combining this with ransomware!All that's required for a malicious or compromised website to exploit the vulnerability is to host a file or other resource that contains the string "cwcsf-nativemsg-iframe-43c85c0d-d633-af5e-c056-32dc7efc570b.html" in its URL

- That's a "magic" pattern the WebEx service uses to remotely start a meeting on visiting computers that have the Chrome extension installed

- Ormandy discovered that any visited website can invoke the command not just to begin a WebEx session, but to execute any code or command of the attacker's choice

## Kaspersky cybercrime investigator cuffed in Russian treason probe

- "Ruslan Stoyanov is under investigation for a period predating his employment at Kaspersky Lab.

- The work of Kaspersky Lab's Computer Incidents Investigation Team is unaffected by these developments.

- Both were arrested in December as part of a probe over the receipt of money from foreign companies. Prior to joining Kaspersky Lab in 2012, Stoyanov worked in the private sector and before that served as a major in the Ministry of Interior's cybercrime unit between 2000 and 2006.

- Stoyanov worked as lead investigator into a Russian hacking crew that extorted UK bookmakers through running DDoS attacks and more recently investigating the Lurk cybercrime gang. Forbes, citing unnamed Russian information security sources, said the case against Stoyanov was filled under article 275 of Russia's criminal code, meaning it could be handled by a military tribunal. Article 275 allows the Russian government to prosecute when an individual provides assistance to a foreign state or organisation regarding "hostile activities to the detriment of the external security of the Russian Federation".

- This is a broadly defined offence that might be taken to cover the sharing of threat intelligence data with foreign law enforcement or intel agencies.

## Virulent Android malware returns, gets >2 million downloads on Google Play

-                   Enlargeportal gda    A virulent family of malware that infected more than 10 million Android devices last year has made a comeback, this time hiding inside Google Play apps that have been downloaded by as many as 12 million unsuspecting users.HummingWhale, as the professionally developed malware has been dubbed, is a variant of HummingBad, the name given to a family of malicious apps researchers documented in July invading non-Google app markets

- HummingBad attempted to override security protections by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities that gave the malware root privileges in older versions of Android

- Before Google shut it down, it installed more than 50,000 fraudulent apps each day, displayed 20 million malicious advertisements, and generated more than $300,000 per month in revenue

- Of the 10 million people who downloaded HummingBad-contaminated apps, an estimated 286,000 of them were located in the US.HummingWhale, by contrast, managed to sneak its way into about 20 Google Play apps that were downloaded from 2 million to 12 million times, according to researchers from Check Point, the security company that has been closely following the malware family for almost a year

- Rather than rooting devices, the latest variant includes new virtual machine techniques that allow the malware to perform ad fraud better than ever, company researchers said in a blog post published Monday."Users must realize that they can no longer trust in installing only apps with a high reputation from official app stores as their sole defense," the researchers wrote in an e-mail to Ars

- "This malware employs several tactics to keep its activity hidden, meaning users might be unaware of its existence on their device."As was the case with HummingBad, the purpose of HummingWhale is to generate revenue by displaying fraudulent ads and automatically installing apps

- When users try to close the ads, the new functionality causes already downloaded apps to run in a virtual machine

- That creates a fake ID that allows the perpetrators to generate referral revenues

## 'Celebgate' nudes thief gets just nine months of porridge

- An American bloke has been jailed for breaking into the online accounts of 30 or so celebrities (and 270 other people) and swiping their most intimate snaps and secrets. Edward Majerczyk, 29, of Orland Park, Illinois will spend nine months in federal prison.

- In a deal with prosecutors last July, he pleaded guilty to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information.

- Members of society whose information is in demand can be even more vulnerable, and directly targeted. In addition to his sentence, handed down on Tuesday this week, Majerczyk was ordered to pay $5,700 to foot one celebrity victim's therapy bills.

- The FBI also confiscated the hacker's Gateway computer, another desktop system, his iPhone, and various items of storage media. "At the time of the offense, Mr Majerczyk was suffering from depression and looked at pornography websites and internet chat rooms in an attempt to fill some of the voids and disappointments he was feeling in his life," his lawyer, Thomas Needham, told the court [PDF]. "After accessing the personal information and photographs for his personal viewing, he learned that others were distributing these private images on the internet.

- Meanwhile in October last year, Ryan Collins, 36, of Pennsylvania, was jailed for 18 months for stealing similar snaps from people's accounts.

## President Trump is still using his old, unsecured Android phone

-                   Enlarge / The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, Samsung's most recent (non-exploding) flagship smartphones

- Ron Amadeo    Donald Trump continues to use his "old, unsecured Android phone" since taking office despite "the protests of some of his aides," according to a report from The New York Times about how the new president is settling in to his routine

- This contradicts another report from late last week that indicated Trump had given up the phone in exchange for a "secure, encrypted device approved by the Secret Service."It's not clear exactly what kind of Android phone Trump useshe has previously indicated that it's a Samsung Galaxy deviceor whether it has also been encrypted or otherwise hardened or what kinds of things he uses it for

- Samsung's Knox software is approved for "sensitive but unclassified use" by the US Department of Defense, so these phones are cleared for at least some kinds of government work when configured correctly.How big of a deal is this? We don't know anything about the phone's configuration, but the state of Android security is notoriously poor compared to other operating systems like iOS or Windows, both of which are patched regularly by Apple and Microsoft with no interference from hardware manufacturers or wireless carriers

- Google releases monthly security updates for Android, and Samsung is better than most about actually releasing those updates to its most recent devices (flagship phones tend to get monthly updates, midrange phones and most tablets get quarterly patches), but there is still often a gap of several days or weeks between when those security bulletins are published and when the patches are available.In any case, it's surprising that Trump has kept his old phonethe Trump campaign spent months criticizing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her alleged mishandling of sensitive e-mails, and her campaign has claimed that the FBI's statements on the case may have cost her the election

- President Obama was only given a smartphone last year, and in interviews he claimed that it had been so locked down that it couldn't even be used to take pictures or send text messages."A lot of the newfangled stuff for security reasons, I don't get," Obama said in 2015.

## President Trump tweets from insecure Android, security boffins roll eyes

- Avi Rosen, CEO of mobile security specialist Kaymera, commented: "The president has reportedly been given a locked-down phone by the NSA.

- " German Chancellor Angela Merkel's second smartphone, which she used for party business, was infamously pwned by multiple intel agencies, including but not limited to the NSA. This all sits awkwardly with Trump's strident criticism of Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email server during the time she served as Secretary of State.

- The angry late-night tweets came from an Android phone, leading data analysts to conclude that they came from Trump himself.

- The Apple updates were different in tone and character and are thought to come from Trump campaign staffers. Rosen warned: "If the president  or even one of his core team  is using a second device, it has to be fully secured against all threats.

- All it takes is clicking on a single malicious link or opening an innocent-looking attachment to compromise the device, and these can easily look as if they come from a trusted source."

## Million requests per second with Python

- Is it possible to hit a million requests per second with Python? Probably not until recently.A lot of companies are migrating away from Python and to other programming languages so that they can boost their operation performance and save on server prices, but theres no need really

- Python can be right tool for the job.The Python community is doing a lot of around performance lately

- CPython 3.6 boosted overall interpreter performance with new dictionary implementation

- CPython 3.7 is going to be even faster, thanks to the introduction of faster call convention and dictionary lookup caches.For number crunching tasks you can use PyPy with its just-in-time code compilation

- You can also run NumPys test suite, which now has improved overall compatibility with C extensions

- Later this year PyPy is expected to reach Python 3.5 conformance.All this great work inspired me to innovate in one of the areas where Python is used extensively: web and micro-service development.Enter Japronto!Japronto is a brand new micro-framework tailored for your micro-services needs

- Its main goals include being fast, scalable, and lightweight

- It lets you do both synchronous and asynchronous programming thanks to asyncio

## Dropbox Finally Brings Its Google Docs Competitor Out of Beta

- 88885625story Dropbox Finally Brings Its Google Docs Competitor Out of Beta  (theverge.com)   Dropbox today made Paper -- its note-taking app that it's emphasizing is a tool that's built for managing workflow as well -- global

- In addition to the launch of Paper, the company said that users will also be able to automatically generate presentations in Keynote and other applications through the app

- From a report: Dropbox's software is similar to Google's suite of workplace cloud apps

- Paper -- itself a minimal document editor and writing tool like Google Docs -- is the focal point, while all of Dropbox's other services and features now plug into and augment the experience

- Paper is Dropbox's latest attempt to court businesses away from Microsoft and Google, or at the very least to encourage companies to pay for Dropbox services on top of what they already use institutionally

- It's part of Dropbox's ongoing shift away from consumer storage and apps and toward enterprise software that is both more lucrative and self-sustaining

- The company shut down its Mailbox email app and Carousel photo storage service back in 2015

- In place of its consumer focus, Dropbox has been pouring more resources into Paper and other projects that make its mobile apps and website a place to perform work, instead of a barebones destination for files.

## Tesla Motors, Inc. Is Now Officially Tesla, Inc

-  Tesla has officially changed its name to Tesla, Inc., from its previous official corporate title of Tesla Motors, Inc.

- The name change likely reflects the expanded nature of its business now that it own SolarCity, and creates battery packs for both home and commercial use, aspects of the company which Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said previously will take on growing importance to its business overall. Tesla, Inc. picked up SolarCity in late 2016, a solar power company founded by Musks cousins where he also acted as chairman of the board.

- Tesla also introduced its second-generation Powerwall battery storage device for home use last year, as well as its Powerpack 2.0 commercial solar energy storage solution.

- The company also revealed plans to create solar roof panels that look like ordinary roof tiles, which it aims to begin shipping to customers later this year. The company changed its website URL from Teslamotors.com to just Tesla.com last year, and it lists itself as not just an automaker, but also a technology and design company with a focus on energy innovation in its official about page, so the official name change was a long time coming.

## Scott Kelly's DNA shows unexpected telomere lengthening after year in space

- Measurements taken before, during and after Scott Kellys mission reveal changes in gene expression, DNA methylation and other biological markers that are likely to be attributable to his time in orbit.																				From the lengths of the twins chromosomes to the microbiomes in their guts, almost everyone is reporting that we see differences, says Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.

- The data are so fresh that some of them are still coming off the sequencing machines, Mason says.																				The challenge now is to untangle how many of the observed changes are specific to the physical demands of spaceflight  and how many might be simply due to natural variations.

- The greatest importance of the study is to show that we can do it, says team member Andrew Feinberg, a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.

- But the changes in Scott seemed to be larger than normal  perhaps due to the stress of eating freeze-dried food and trying to sleep while floating in space.																				Data splashdown?																				Personalized medicine could play into NASAs plans for how to keep astronauts healthy during long-duration spaceflight, such as any future trips to Mars.

- For instance, the agency might want to use genetic tests to screen astronaut candidates for cancer susceptibility, says a 6 January report from the US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine.																				Actually publishing the results of the twin study will take some time, and the full data may never come out.

## The Future of iOS is 64-Bit Only -- Apple To Stop Support For 32-Bit Apps

- Your ability to run 32-bit apps on an iOS device is coming to an end.

- As several other Apple news sites have reported, Apple has updated the pop-up warning in the iOS 10.3 beta to say that the 32-bit app you're running "will not work with future versions of iOS." The warning goes on to say that the "developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility."

- From a ComputerWorld article (edited for clarity): In October 2014, Apple told developers that all new apps created after February 1, 2015 must have 64-bit support.

- Shortly after, Apple announced that all updates to apps must also be 64-bit compatible.

- An announcement will likely be made during Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference this summer.

## HTTPS Adoption Has Reached the Tipping Point

- Security expert Troy Hunt, who is perhaps best known for creating Have I Been Pwned data breach service, argues that adoption of HTTPS has reached the tipping point, citing "some really significant things" that have happened in the past few months.

- From a blog post: We've already passed the halfway mark for requests served over HTTPS -- This was one of the first signs that we'd finally hit that tipping point and it came a few months ago.

- all do all their things over HTTPS and that keeps that number quite high. Hunt also cited security aficionado Scott Helme's recent analysis which found that the number of websites listed in Alexa's top one million websites that have adopted to HTTPS has more than doubled year from August 2015 to August 2016.

- Troy adds: Browsers are holding non-secure sites more accountable.

- (He cites websites such as ArsTechnica, NYTimes as examples). Making more cases for his argument, Hunt adds that HTTPS sites are not slow as they used to be, and that services such as Let's Encrypt and Cloudflare have made it free and east to bring this security feature.

## Facebook Has Been Intentionally Crashing Its Android App on Users

- To test the limits of consumer patience, the company crashed the app again and again and again to see who stuck around.Brian Solis / FlickrFacebook is no stranger to "Is this in my terms of service?" experiments, like when they performed a psychology experiment on unsuspecting users

- But a report from The Information  indicates they didn't quite learn their lesson

- In order to test the limits of how much their user base would put up with constant app crashes, the company intentionally crashed the app multiple times

- Partly, the move is over a contentious relationship Facebook has with Google

- The search engine giant alleges that the social networking site deployed a series of apps within the app over Google's terms of service for the Google Play store

- Facebook wanted a contingency plan in case the app was taken off of Google Play

- Instead, the app would come preloaded on Android phones through deals between Facebook and phone manufacturers like Samsung.Most of the article from The Information is about the bickering between Facebook and Google, and the information about the experiment is buried near the end

- Amir Efrati writes:Facebook has tested the loyalty and patience of Android users by secretly introducing artificial errors that would automatically crash the app for hours at a time, says one person familiar with the one-time experiment

## WordPress fixed god-mode zero day without disclosing the problem

-                                 Last week's WordPress patch run fixed a then-secret zero day bug that let remote unauthorised hackers edit or delete WordPress pages.                The remote privilege escalation and content injection hole hits Wordpress versions 4.7 and 4.7.1 and allows all pages on unpatched sites to be modified, redirecting visitors to exploits and a myriad of attacks.                                                                                                        WordPress slipped in the fix, but didn't reveal it in the hope hackers would not exploit a flaw they didn't know about.                WordPress, the world's most popular content management system (CMS), used on millions of websites, pushed update 4.7.2 last week in a patch run that shuttered SQL injection vulnerabilities.                Security researcher Marc-Alexandre Montpas (@MarcS0h) informed the CMS giant on 20 January about the undocumented vulnerability.                WordPress tipped off security firms including SiteLock, Cloudflare, and Incapsula along with WordPress hosts over the nine days between disclosure and patch.                Security firms did not report live attacks under the rule sets they cooked while hosts worked closely with WordPress security to patch installations.                Core contributor Aaron Campbell says the disclosure was delayed to give web admins time to update.                "We believe transparency is in the public's best interest ..

- in this case, we intentionally delayed disclosing this issue by one week to ensure the safety of millions of additional WordPress sites," Campbell says.                "Data from all four WAFs and WordPress hosts showed no indication that the vulnerability had been exploited in the wild.                "As a result, we made the decision to delay disclosure of this particular issue to give time for automatic updates to run and ensure as many users as possible were protected before the issue was made public."                Campbell says millions of WordPress installations were automatically patched against the then-undisclosed bug in the few hours after the patch was issued.                Montpas described the bug in detail, rating the flaw critical.                "Due to [a] type-juggling issue, it is then possible for an attacker to change the content of any post or page on a victim's site," Montpas says.                "From there, they can add plugin-specific shortcodes to exploit vulnerabilities that would otherwise be restricted to contributor roles, infect the site content with a search engine optimisation spam campaign, or inject ads, etcetera.                "Depending on the plugins enabled on the site, even PHP code could be executed very easily."                Akamai principal threat researcher Ryan Barnett says it has not detected exploit attempts and will continue to monitor for the likely attacks that will surface once news of the bug spreads

## Google mistakes the entire NHS for massive cyber-attacking botnet

- Exclusive Google is blocking access to the entire NHS network, mistaking the amount of traffic it is currently receiving as a cyber attack. An email from an NHS trust's IT department seen by The Register confirmed that the US search giant has mistaken the current traffic levels for a botnet.  

- The email headed "Google Access" stated: "Google is intermittently blocking access due to the amount of traffic from NHS Trusts Nationally (This is not being blocked by the IT Department). "This is causing Google to think it is suffering from a cyber-attack. "We are advising staff to use an alternative search engine i.e. Bing to bypass this problem. "If you have 'Chrome' on your desktop the page will display correctly but if you 'should' get a CAPTCHA pop up, please follow the instructions to continue.

- " The source said they did not know why Google had suddenly decided to block access to the NHS net, but confirmed it was the "go-to resource" for a lot of clinicians. The Register has contacted NHS Digital and Google for a comment. Controversially, Google is also attempting to drum up business with the NHS through its DeepMind AI business. Last year it emerged that the Royal Free NHS trust had signed a deal with DeepMind to give the outfit access to 1.6 million patient records, without explicit permission from patients. It has since won a deal with Moorfields Eye Hospital to access one million anonymous eye scans. The NHS is one of the biggest employers in the world, with 1.2 million people working for the organisation. Earlier this week it emerged that a reply-all NHS email fail in Croydon resulted in 500 million emails being sent across the NHS in just 75 minutes. Google refused to comment but said: "It is not correct to say we have blocked the entire NHS network."

-  Updated at 12:31 UTC on Wednesday 1 February to add: An NHS Digital spokesman contacted The Reg to say: We are aware of the current issue concerning NHS IP addresses which occasionally results in users being directed to a simple verification form when accessing Google.

- This would appear to be due to the high number of people using our systems and trying to access Google at peak times.

## 33C3: How Can You Trust Your Random Numbers?

- [Vladimir Klebanov] (right) and [Felix Dorre] (left) provided a framework for making sure that PRNGs are doing what they should.

- If youre old enough to remember the Debian OpenSSL debacle of 2008, essentially every Internet service was backdoorable due to bad random numbers.

- If you can run through an arbitrarily large number of seeds and outputs, you could possibly brute-force this test (hopefully before the universe dies its inevitable heat death). Or you could do it analytically.

- Using their entroposcope, they trace the loss of entropy through the flow of the program, find the bug, and save the day. This isnt a beginners talk on cryptographic PRNGs, but its a darn good one.

- As the pair pointed out in the question and answer, the only way to be sure within a reasonable amount of time is to dig through the code and verify that its not.

-                                 Google Chrome engineer Eric Lawrence has described the battle of browser barons against the 'line of death', an ever-diminishing demarcation between trusted content and the no-man's land where phishers dangle their poison.                The line, Lawrence (@ericlaw) says, is a conceptual barrier between content that browser developers control, such as areas around the address bar, and untrusted content like browser windows where attackers can serve malicious material.                                                                                                        "If a user trusts pixels above the line of death, the thinking goes, theyll be safe, but if they can be convinced to trust the pixels below the line, theyre gonna die," Lawrence says.                But the line is receding because untrusted content now appears above the line in tabs where attackers can enter their chosen web page title and icon.                Chevrons that open small windows can display extended information on usage of HTTPS, requests for location information, and so on extend below the line and send trusted data into untrusted territory.                Chevrons with trusted data breach the line

- Image: Lawrence.                Those subtle intrusions across the line open avenues for phishers; chevron popups can be faked and 'block' and 'allow' buttons turned into malicious clickable links, for example.                In 2005, a remote code execution flaw affecting Firefox was dug up which abused favicons, the untrusted icons websites set that appear in tabs and bookmarks.                The line of death deteriorated in 2012 when Microsoft moved Windows 8 Internet Explorer to its full screen minimalistic immersive mode

- Lawrence, then program lead for Internet Explorer with Microsoft, opposed the move and says it made the line of death indistinguishable from content, .                "..

- because it (Internet Explorer) was designed with a philosophy of 'content over chrome', there were no reliable trustworthy pixels," he says

- "I begged for a persistent trust badge to adorn the bottom-right of the screen - showing a security origin and a lock - but was overruled."                He says one Microsoft security wonk built a "visually-perfect" Paypal phishing site that duped the browser and threw fake indicators

- "It was terrifying stuff, mitigated only by the hope that no one would use the new mode."                The breaching of the line of death is a boon to picture-in-picture phishing attacks, in which attackers create what appear to be fully functional browsers within a browser

- Immaculate reproductions of browsers including the trusted sections above the line of death have been created that fool even eagle-eyed researchers.                Microsoft's own security researchers in 2007 would find picture-in-picture attacks to be virtually perfect

- The team of four wrote, in a paper titled An Evaluation of Extended Validation and Picture-in-Picture Phishing Attacks wrote in the paper [PDF] that the attack vector was so compelling it beat all other phishing techniques including homograph tricks in which letters of legitimate URLs are replaced with visually similar equivalents from, for example, the Cyrillic alphabet.                Everything is untrusted: The line of death dies in HTML5

## Snapchat will file for IPO next week

- Above: Snapchat billboard in Times Square, New York City on May 19, 2015.Image Credit: Ken Yeung(By Lauren Hirsch and Liana B

- Baker, Reuters)  Snap Inc., the secretive technology company that owns the popular messaging service Snapchat, is due to reveal its financials within a week as it moves toward its eagerly awaited initial public offering (IPO), sources familiar with the situation said on Friday.The Venice, California-based company will publish the registration document it secretly filed with U.S regulators last autumn, containing a dossier of tightly held finances and its plans for operating as a public company.The sources, who cautioned that Snapchats plans may still change, asked not to be named because the information is private

- A spokeswoman for Snap Inc

- declined to comment.Snap Inc expects to go public as soon as March and could be valued at $20 billion to $25 billion, based on reports of its latest round of funding, which would make it the largest U.S

- technology IPO since Facebooks in 2012.Snapchat has already confidentially filed with the U.S

- Securities and Exchange Commission under the U.S

- Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act

- Under that law, companies with less than $1 billion in revenue can secretly file for an IPO, allowing them to quietly test investor appetite.A company must make its initial IPO prospectus filing, officially known as an S-1, public at least 15 days before beginning its so-called road show, in which it markets the IPO to investors.The prospectus details a companys business background, finances and corporate governance for investors

## Rebuilding, Testing and Documenting Self-Made Wi-Fi Antennas

- Pretty Fly For A Wi-Fi revisits the histories, origins and uses of self-made Wi-Fi antennas

- Many of these designs were once shared through home pages that no longer exist and are now only partially accessible through the Internet Archive

- It is a combination of pots and pans, dishes and cans through which people from around the world give shape to their collective dream of making an alternative internet.This project tries to revive these designs by rebuilding, testing and documenting them

- The antennas serve as an interesting point of departure to think about the internets infrastructure and how day-to-day users could potentially influence its shape and use.Most of the antennas result out of the idea of wireless community networks, an idea which emerged shortly after the commercial introduction of Wi-Fi equipment in the early 2000s

- These grassroots initiatives aim to build alternative network infrastructures, often on a peer-to-peer basis and without the need for costly wires

- Such network infrastructures can be found on rooftops, balconies and windowsills and can cover large distances by broadcasting from building to building.They are built for a variety of reasons, sometimes to provide broadband connections in areas where there are none, to make censorship free alternatives to the internet or to share the costs of a single internet connection.More: Roel Roscam Abbings website (pictures)  Lidia Pereiras booklet (drawings, PDF).Previously: How to Build a Low-tech Internet.

## What's new in Docker 1.13: prune, secrets, checkpoints and more

- Lets see whats new. Prune all the things! Before we begin, let us first express our gratitude to Spotify with a moment of silence, as we bid farewell to docker-gc.

- It has served us well, to the point where its hard to imagine a Jenkins setup without it. Its official replacement is prune, which has got to be one of the most awaited for features in recent Docker history.

- No longer will our build machines and long-running instances become clogged up with the dusty remnants of obsolete containers and images. docker container prune will delete all stopped containers. docker image prune will banish all dangling images to beyond the wall.

- You can think of stacks as compose for swarm  a way to define how multiple, scaled services are deployed together in Swarm Mode. If you want to upgrade to v3, theres an upgrading guide. Aside from the familiar Compose syntax, there is also support for the experimental Bundle format, which is JSON based.

- It remains to be seen if any other vendor actually adopts this format, so, for now, its benefits are unclear to yours truly. Try it out Weve updated our Docker-ready VM templates here at CloudShare with version 1.13, so itll work out of the box if you want to try it out.  Well be releasing a few more Docker-related features soon: a docker-machine driver for CloudShare, an Environment Blueprint for Docker Swarm, and more.

- I'm using .net's SHA512Managed and SHA256Managed classes

- The code is similar to the one posted here but I'm referring to tests taking caching into account (from the second time reading the file onwards it seems that it's cached completely)

- 32-bit platforms vs 64-bit platforms can make a significant difference, as well as the amount of data you're hashing.$ uname -mx86_64$ openssl speed sha256 sha512The 'numbers' are in 1000s of bytes per second processed.type             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytessha256           29685.74k    79537.52k   148376.58k   186700.77k   196588.36ksha512           23606.96k    96415.90k   173050.74k   253669.59k   291315.50As you can see, on my 64-bit machine, SHA-512 beats SHA-256 for hashing anything more than 16 bytes of data at a time

- And generally, the more data being hashed at once, the bigger the performance improvement.Edit: As @MaartenBodewes points out in the comments, there's also SHA-512/256 which does the same computation as normal SHA-512 (with a different initial value) but truncates the output to 256 bits

- This is a better option (due to the different IV) than simply truncating the output of SHA-512 to 256 bits by yourself in the case where you need the higher throughput but are limited to 256 bit outputs

## Time to Upgrade Your Python: TLS v1.2 Will Soon Be Mandatory

- If you're using an older Python without the most secure TLS implementation, this is the year to get serious about upgrading

- Otherwise next June you may not be able to "pip install" packages from PyPI.PyPI's maintainer Donald Stufft recently announced that python.org and related sites will begin disabling the old TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1

- This change was imposed on us by our content delivery network, Fastly, in response to a change imposed on them by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council

- In order to continue serving websites that take credit card payments, Fastly is required to disable the old, insecure versions of TLS

- Since the PSF's servers, including PyPI, use Fastly, the old versions of TLS will be disabled as well.Fastly wrote in October 2015,There have been serious and systemic security issues with earlier versions of TLS and its predecessor, SSL, including POODLE, Heartbleed, and LOGJAM

- These threatened to break trust in fundamental methods of secure communication, exposing both you and your customers to breaches in security

- The actions of the PCI DSS Council to maintain a high minimum bar are a step towards ensuring the security of all online business transactions.There are two deadlines to upgrade your Python to a version with the latest TLS

- The first comes soon, on April 30, 2017, when python.org sites without Extended Validation Certificates will stop supporting TLS 1.0 and 1.1

## Microsoft's browsers return to losing habits, fall to 25% share

- Microsoft's browsers last month relapsed into bad habits, again losing significant usage share to end January with just over 25%, a milepost that would have been rejected as absurdly low only a year and a half ago.According to data published Wednesday by analytics vendor Net Applications, the user share of IE and Edge -- an estimate of the proportion of the world's personal computer owners who ran those browsers -- fell by a percentage point last month to a combined 25.2%.The one-point decline of IE + Edge was substantially larger than the drop of December, when Computerworld interpreted that month's seven-tenths of a point reduction as a sign that Microsoft's browsers might be nearing the end of their slide

- Instead, January's quickening silenced that signal.By Net Applications' measurements, IE has already dropped under the 20% mark -- for January, the former kingpin accounted for 19.7% -- and the gains by Edge, which added just 0.15 of a percentage point to its share in the month, have not been nearly enough to cover IE's decay

- For January, Edge accounted for 5.5% of all browsers. Projections of the IE + Edge combination hint at an increasingly ugly future

- IE and Edge could fall under 20% as soon as April, and likely no later than June, according to the 12- and three-month trends in the Net Applications data.January's biggest beneficiary was again Chrome, which added another 1.4 percentage points to its user share, reaching a record 57.9%

- Computerworld's forecast -- again using Net Applications' data trends -- puts Chrome over the 60% bar by the end of April at the latest.Mozilla's Firefox, which in the last third of 2016 recovered much of the share it lost earlier in the year, returned to its slump, losing half a percentage point and dropping to 11.8%.Although Microsoft has tried to promote Edge -- yesterday the firm touted changes and feature additions to the browser due in the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update -- the effort has not paid off

- Last month, just 22% of all Windows 10 users ran Edge as their primary browser, down from 26% a year earlier. Edge hasn't accounted for more than a third of all Windows 10 browsers since October 2015.Computerworld/Data: Net ApplicationsUsing Net Applications' data for browser and operating system user share, Computerworld translated the IE + Edge decline in terms of millions of users

- Since the start of 2016, Microsoft has shed more than 385 million users, and is now in danger of slipping under the 400-million mark.To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream

## Using Vim as a Python IDE

- Here are some useful plugins and tools for building a delightful vim python environment, escpecially for Vim8:As you can see, tmux is also one of my favourite tools in terminal.Syntax CheckingIf you use Vim8, w0rp/ale is a better option than syntastic, for it utilizes the async feature in Vim8, you will never get stuck due to the syntax checking.

- Its similar to flycheck in emacs, which allows you to lint while you type. (taken from ale)Code Formattergoogle/yapf can be used to format python code.

- Here is the description from neomakes README:It is intended to replace the built-in :make command and provides functionality similar to plugins like syntastic and dispatch.vim.

- Basically, you will have one side of your terminal using Vim and the other side will be where you run your scripts.Enhance the default python syntax highlightingpython-mode/python-mode provides a more precise python syntax highlighting than the defaults.

- )SummaryThere are also some neccessary general programming plugins, e.g., scrooloose/nerdcommenter for convenient commenter, Yggdroot/indentLine or nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides for visually displaying indent levels in Vim, etc.Although vim is great and many plugins are productive, IDE is still my first choice when it comes to refactoring code :).For more details, please see space-vim, enable ycmd, syntax-checking, python, programming Layer , then you could get a nice vim environment for python like the screenshot.

- He files a report on his activities at the end of each day.Sony, Mr

- Tanis employer of 32 years, consigned him to this room because they cant get rid of him

- Sony had eliminated his position at the Sony Sendai Technology Center, which in better times produced magnetic tapes for videos and cassettes

- But Mr

- Tani, 51, refused to take an early retirement offer from Sony in late 2010  his prerogative under Japanese labor law.So there he sits in what is called the chasing-out room. He spends his days there, with about 40 other holdouts.I wont leave, Mr

## Was Snowden a Russian Agent?

- His movie steps on the genuine privacy issues raised by Snowdens disclosures with melodramatic embellishments, such as a scene in which an invented senior NSA official, his Orwellian face filling a floor-to-ceiling screen, casually reveals that he knows whether the Snowden characters girlfriend is sleeping with another man.

- The point is to assure that any alternative that fits the relevant facts, no matter how implausible it may initially seem to be, is not neglected.And so Epstein asks: What if Snowden told secrets to Russian intelligence officials or brought files to Moscow, despite saying otherwise?

- But Epstein omits what Chris Inglis, who was deputy director of the NSA from 2006 to 2014 and oversaw that investigation, said last March when asked whether Snowden had acted as a spy or from his own convictions:Here is what I surmise based upon a careful observation of the facts available to me.

- Without much warning, he writes that he sees no reason to doubt [Snowdens] explanation that he stole NSA documents to expose its surveillance because he believed that it was an illicit intrusion into the privacy of individuals. Epstein continues to criticize Snowden for taking documents that did not concern domestic spying, and he still maintains, vaguely, that by the end Snowdens mission evolved, deliberately or not, into one that led him to disclose key communications intelligence secrets to a foreign power. But he states that he fully accepts that Snowden began as a whistle-blower, not as a spy, and was still acting as a whistle-blower when he reached out to the journalists.By pulling back at the end of his book, Epstein tries to have it both ways: weaving conspiracy theories while maintaining plausible deniability and some veneer of evidence-based journalism.

- How America Lost Its Secrets fails to live up to Epsteins own principle, jotted down on that 35 card for his debate with Oliver Stone about JFK so many years ago: when a nonfiction writer reaches the limits of discoverable fact, he is supposed to stopnot fill in whatever gaps exist with his imagination, no matter how strong his intuition or suspicion.

## Security Risks of the President's Android Phone

- Blog             Security Risks of the President's Android Phone        Reports are that President Trump is still using his old Android phone

- There are security risks here, but they are not the obvious ones.I'm not concerned about the data

- Anything he reads on that screen is coming from the insecure network that we all use, and any e-mails, texts, Tweets, and whatever are going out to that same network

- But this is a consumer device, and it's going to have security vulnerabilities

- He's at risk from everybody, ranging from lone hackers to the better-funded intelligence agencies of the world

- And while the risk of a forged e-mail is real -- it could easily move the stock market -- the bigger risk is eavesdropping

- That Android has a microphone, which means that it can be turned into a room bug without anyone's knowledge

- That's my real fear.I commented in this story.EDITED TO ADD (1/27): Nicholas Weaver comments.                I must note a clear double editorial standard with respect to political candidates here:- Hillary Clinton had a non secure server that contained classified information that many cyber security experts believe was compromise by foreign state actors

## Punk tech versus consumer tech

- Here's a link to the episode with lots of detailed shownotes on Stefan's Working Together blog.

- This DIY electronics project uses a small vibrating motor to gently wave a tissue paper heart and flash an LED when it receives instructions over the internet from another device.

- I built two versions of the ESP8266 wifi circuit, also equipped with two buttons [...] READ THE REST

- The new, 2.0 version of the project, is to port Zork I (via a z-code interpreter) to an embedded platform, and [...] READ THE REST

- For less than the price of a dinner for two, Raspberry Pi offers a full desktop experience on a board the size of a deck of cards.

## Reports claim Spanish police have arrested hacker Phineas Fisher

-                                 Spanish cops investigating an attack on a Catalan police union last May have arrested three suspects, including a hacker alleged to be behind high-profile attacks against spyware-for-cops firms Hacking Team and Gamma International.                Phineas Fisher claimed responsibility for the hack and subsequent leak of sensitive information from Hacking Team in 2015 as well as an earlier assault on UK-based Gamma International, the firm behind FinFisher, back in August 2014.                                                                                                        The three (as yet unnamed) suspects were arrested as part of an investigation into an attack against Sindicat de Mossos d'Esquadra (SME), the Catalan police union

- Phineas Fisher claimed credit for the attack, which resulted in the leak of personal information of up to 5,500 serving police officers.                Spain's Policia Nacional (national police) detained a couple in Barcelona and a 33-year-old man in Salamanca on suspicion of the crime on Tuesday

- The Salamanca suspect is Phineas Fisher, according to local reports.                Someone using Phineas Fisher's email address surfaced hours after the arrest to claim police had arrested an activist rather than him

- "I think the Mossos just arrested some people that retweeted the link to their personal info, or maybe just arrested some activisty/anarchisty people to pretend they are doing something," they said in an email shared through an intermediary with Motherboard.                Spanish daily El Pais has more on the story here

## New H1-B Visa bill doubles the salary requirements to $130K/yr

-   WASHINGTON: In what will be a  big blow to IT firms in India+  , a legislation was introduced in the US House of Representatives on Monday mandating that the minimum salary of H-1B visa holders be doubled to $130,000.      If the legislation is passed, it will become very difficult for American companies to use H1-B visas to  hire foreign workers+  , including IT professionals from India.      The  BSE IT index slumped over four per cent+  at news of the introduction of the new legislation.      The legislation "offers a market-based solution that gives priority to those companies willing to pay the most," said Congressman Zoe Lofgren, who introduced it

- "This ensures American employers have access to the talent they need, while removing incentives for companies to undercut American wages and outsource jobs," he said.      The legislation, called the High-Skilled Integrity and Fairness Act of 2017, prioritises market-based allocation of visas to those companies willing to pay as much as 200 per cent of a wage calculated by the survey.      The legislation also proposes eliminating the 'lowest pay' category

- The raised salary level - to more than $130,000 - is more than double the current H-1B minimum wage of $60,000, which was established in 1989 and has since remained unchanged.      "My legislation refocuses the H-1B programme to its original intent - to seek out and find the best and brightest from around the world, and to supplement the US workforce with talented, highly-paid, and highly-skilled workers who help create jobs here in America, not replace them," said Lofgren.      The Congressman said the legislation also proposes removing the 'per country' cap for employment-based immigrant visas, so that  all workers are treated more fairly+  and to move to a system where employers hire the most skilled workers without regard to national origin.      It raises the salary level at which H-1B dependent employers are exempt from attestation requirements to a new required wage level of 35 percentile points above the median national annual wage for Computer and Mathematical Occupations published by the Department of Labour Occupational Employment Statistics (roughly $132,000), which would be adjusted in the future without the need for new legislation, and eliminates the Master's Degree exemption for dependent employers.      The legislation sets aside 20 percent of the annually allocated H-1B visas for small and start-up employers (50 or fewer employers) to ensure small businesses have an opportunity to compete for high-skilled workers, while still being protected from outsourcing.      Among other things, Lofgren's legislation removes visa hurdles for students and other temporary visa holders by building a bridge from F-1 student status to Lawful Permanent Residence

- It also removes paperwork burdens by streamlining H-1B filing requirements and reducing administrative costs.      The legislation tightens employee protection by stipulating that employers may not reduce beneficiary wages, regardless of whether the deduction is in accordance with a voluntary authorisation by the employee.      It makes exceptions for taxes, garnishments and deductions that are reasonable and customary in the occupation.      In a related development, Senator Sherrod Brown announced the introduction of an H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act in the Senate

- The Act, he said, would close loopholes in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs and provide increased protections for both US workers and visa holders.      "We need to crack down on the fraud and abuse that allows corporations to avoid paying Americans fair wages and exploit foreign workers," said Brown.      "During his campaign, President Trump promised to increase oversight of our H-1B and L-1 visa programs and reform starts with this bipartisan legislation to ensure that American businesses are giving American workers a fair shot at good-paying jobs," he said.      The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act would require employers to first offer a vacant position to an equally or better qualified American worker before seeking an H-1B or L-1 visa holder.      It would also establish wage requirements for L-1 workers and improve H-1B wage requirements to encourage companies to hire qualified American workers and prevent them from using foreign workers as a source of cheap labour.      Under the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform, the Department of Labor and the Department of Homeland Security will have additional oversight authority to investigate fraud and abuse and also to increase penalties for companies that violate the bill's requirements.      The bill would require the two departments to share information so that visa petitions are effectively scrutinised.

## Why we should all have basic income

- Consider for a moment that from this day forward, on the first day of every month, around $1,000 is deposited into your bank account  because you are a citizen

- This income is independent of every other source of income and guarantees you a monthly starting salary above the poverty line for the rest of your life.What do you do? Possibly of more importance, what dont you do? How does this firm foundation of economic security and positive freedom affect your present and future decisions, from the work you choose to the relationships you maintain, to the risks you take?The idea is called unconditional or universal basic income, or UBI

- Its like social security for all, and its taking root within minds around the world and across the entire political spectrum, for a multitude of converging reasons

- Rising inequality, decades of stagnant wages, the transformation of lifelong careers into sub-hourly tasks, exponentially advancing technology like robots and deep neural networks increasingly capable of replacing potentially half of all human labour, world-changing events like Brexit and the election of Donald Trump  all of these and more are pointing to the need to start permanently guaranteeing everyone at least some income.    A promise of equal opportunityBasic income would be an amount sufficient to secure basic needs as a permanent earnings floor no one could fall beneath, and would replace many of todays temporary benefits, which are given only in case of emergency, and/or only to those who successfully pass the applied qualification tests

- UBI would be a promise of equal opportunity, not equal outcome, a new starting line set above the poverty line.It may surprise you to learn that a partial UBI has already existed in Alaska since 1982, and that a version of basic income was experimentally tested in the United States in the 1970s

- The same is true in Canada, where the town of Dauphin managed to eliminate poverty for five years

- Full UBI experiments have been done more recently in places such as Namibia, India and Brazil

- Other countries are following suit: Finland, the Netherlands and Canada are carrying out government-funded experiments to compare against existing programmes

## Reuters editor-in-chief instructs journalists on how to cover the new Administration

- Reuters Editor-in-Chief Steve Adler is proud of the way his news organization is able to provide high-quality, fact-based journalism in oppressive places like Turkey, the Philippines, Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, Thailand, China, Zimbabwe, and Russia, "nations in which we sometimes encounter some combination of censorship, legal prosecution, visa denials, and even physical threats to our journalists."

- --Dont take too dark a view of the reporting environment: Its an opportunity for us to practice the skills weve learned in much tougher places around the world and to lead by example  and therefore to provide the freshest, most useful, and most illuminating information and insight of any news organization anywhere.

-  Neil Gorsuch, currently serving on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, is Donald Trumps pick to fill the seat opened by Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalias death.

- The youngest nominee in 25 years, 49-year-old Gorsuch could provide decades of reliably conservative opinion from the bench.

- Whether you want to learn something new or just kick back and binge watch TV, the following items are sure to stimulate one way or another.

## Tor Browser in numbers

-     Tor Browser is the secure and anonymous way to browse the web and access onion services

- Tor Metrics' new visualization of Tor Browser downloads and updates shows that Tor Browser is downloaded 100,000 times from the Tor website every day! These could be new Tor users or existing users who are downloading it again.The Signature downloads subgraph shows that between 5,000 and 15,000 users per day tried to verify that Tor Browser was signed by our developers after downloading it

- Verifying the signature is the surest way to know that that executable is the legitimate version from Tor and not a benign or malicious third-party one

- It is important to increase the number of users that verify their downloads in the future through education and assistance, and knowing the numbers is the first step.The Update pings subgraph shows ~2,000,000 checks for a new Tor Browser version being made every day

- Each running instance of Tor Browser makes a minimum of two such requests per day, and another request at the start of each session

- As of now, we don't have any data on how long a typical Tor Browser session lasts or how often users restart their browser

- But the update number is still useful to observe trends

- For instance, look at the sharp drop of update pings at the end of January

## New White House Privacy Report

- Areas for Further Attention Technology will pose new consumer privacy and security challenges.

- Emerging technology may simultaneously create new challenges and opportunities for law enforcement and national security.

- For the past 240 years, the core of our democracy -- the values that have helped propel the United States of America -- have remained largely the same.

- The fierce independence that encouraged us to break from an oppressive king is the same independence found in young women and men across the country who strive to make their own path in this world and create a life unique unto to themselves.

- So long as that independence is encouraged, so long as it is fostered by the ability to transcend past data points and by the ability to speak and create free from intrusion, the United States will continue to lead the world.

## Dark Web Paying Corporate Workers To Leak Info

-  This is not particularly new news, but the Dark Web paying corporate workers to leak info  especially pertaining to stock prices (earnings reports etc) is setting the mainstream news on fire at the moment.  Its also funny because people constantly contact us asking questions about the Dark Web aka the Dark Net which happens to be the name of this site, a name which existed way before Tor did. Of course the concept of a darknet also way pre-existed Tor as it was a thing way back in the 1970s of designated networks that were isolated from ARPANET. Staff are taking to the dark web to leak corporate secrets for cash, research reveals. Hackers from US-based risk management outfit RedOwl and Israeli threat intelligence firm IntSights worked their way past the interview process to access the private darknet property Kick Ass Marketplace, where they found evidence of staff selling internal corporate secrets to hackers.

- In some cases, staff even collaborated with blackhats to infect their company networks with malware. The staff at an unnamed bank were also found to be helping hackers maintain a persistent presence on their corporate networks. Clients can pay a subscription of up to one bitcoin a month for access to allegedly vetted and accurate insider information which is posted in threads on the site, then cash in on the information they glean. The site is run in part by an administrator known as h3x who in a May interview with DeepDotWeb claimed to be a self-taught cryptographer, economist, investor, and entrepreneurial businessman. h3x has claimed that Kick Ass Marketplace boasts seven administrators, including three hackers and two trading analysts who observe financial markets and vet the integrity of stolen data before posting it to the site. 

-  It is pretty nefarious, though and is giving more ammunition to the naysayers that the dark web is a bad thing and is giving the malicious actors a place to hide. A story that has been trotted out since the Silk Road bust made the existence of Tor (and what goes on inside the network) pretty mainstream. Another dark website the trio studied, dubbed The Stock Insiders, recruits retail staff as mules to help cash out stolen credit cards for reliably-resellable goods like Apple iPhones. The report includes posts where fraudsters seek help from strikers, people willing to walk into stores with stolen credit cards pretending to be legitimate account holders who approach cooperating sales clerks to buy goods. The trio said insider recruitment is active and growing with chatter across public and private forums about the subject doubling from 2015 to 2016. The dark web has created a market for employees to easily monetise insider access, the researchers say. The dark web serves as a vehicle insiders use to cash out on their services through insider trading and payment for stolen credit cards. Sophisticated threat actors use the dark web to find and engage insiders to help place malware behind an organisations perimeter security [and] as a result, any insider with access to the internal network, regardless of technical capability or seniority, presents a risk. Insider theft can be disastrous for some organisations.

- In Australia, theft of sensitive corporate information including designs and customer records can be considered a civil rather than criminal matter, leading to very lengthy and expensive lawsuits. Its pretty hard to stop, or even trace such perpetrators if they have any reasonable understanding of OPSEC.

- Which by the looks of it, they have as the networks have been infiltrated by infosec companies and they havent been busted yet. It doesnt mean given time they wont be busted though, so well be watching for news of that. Source: The Register
