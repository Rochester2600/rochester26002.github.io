## The first five victims of the Stuxnet worm - Hacking News

## (Nothing else) MATor(s): Monitoring the Anonymity of Tor's Path Selection

- In this paper we present MATor: a framework for rigorously assessing the degree of anonymity in the Tor network. The framework explicitly addresses how user anonymity is impacted by real-life characteristics of actually deployed Tor, such as its path selection algorithm, Tor consensus data, and the preferences and the connections of the user.

## How secure is Docker? If you're not running version 1.3.2, NOT VERY

- A nasty vulnerability has been discovered in the Docker application containerization software for Linux that could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges and execute code remotely on affected systems.

- No remediation is available for older versions of Docker and users are advised to upgrade, the company said in a security advisory on Monday.

## Google's Project Loon Can Now Launch Up To 20 Balloons Per Day, Fly 10x Longer

- The Xers also formed a partnership with Raven Aerostar, a company whose balloons have included early NASA near-space probes. Together they confronted problems involving flight duration, control, and power consumption that have baffled balloonists for centuries. Ultimately they came up with a dual-chamber design (one filled with helium, the other with air) and a system of valves that allowed low-energy altitude adjustments. Ballooning is way harder than rocket science, DeVaul says.

## Great Firewall of China Blocks Edgecast CDN, Thousands of Websites Affected

- As far as they are concerned, there is no economic damage, in fact there is an economic incentive since anyone wanting their website to be usable in China would now be best hiring a CDN within China.

- It seems that this whole project was simply going to isolate Chinese netizens further and push China further towards its own separate Internet. This edgecast block will be faced with far less uproar than the ones that came before it, and those caused very little uproar.

## 'Regin': The 'New Stuxnet' spook-grade SOFTWARE WEAPON described

- Regin malware is thought to have been developed by a nation-state because of the financial clout needed to produce code of this complexity. The malware targets organisations in the telecommunications, energy and health sectors.

- including one unconfirmed zero-day in Yahoo! Messenger.

- state.

- Its design makes it highly suited for persistent, long term surveillance operations against targets, the researchers wrote.

## Adobe Reader sandbox popped says Google researcher

- The Acrobat Reader Windows sandbox contains a vulnerability that could allow attackers to break out and gain higher privileges, Google security bod James Forshaw claims.

- While this bug technically isnt fixed, a defence in depth change in 11.0.9 effectively made this difficult if not impossible to exploit,

- While the function resolves the location of the source and destination and ensures they are within the policy there is a timing race once the function calls into the MoveFileEx function in the broker.

## Bitcoin laid bare: Boffins beat anonymity

- few computers and a budget of 1,500 per for servers and traffic charges should be enough to start unmasking users addresses with as much as 60 per cent accuracy.

- If an attacker needed to be stealthy, their success rate would drop to 11 per cent.

- In what they call a generic method to deanonymise a significant fraction of Bitcoin users and correlate their pseudonyms with public IP addresses, the authors say clients can be uniquely identified by their entry nodes, and that these identify the origin of the transaction.

- the boffins reckon they can identify users behind NAT firewalls  and think their attack could be extended to other P2P networks.

- Getting a list of Bitcoin servers using the GETADDR message and working out if the responder is a server using the ADDR response and sending it a VERSION message;
Building a list of nodes as targets for deanonymisation;
Mapping clients to entry nodes; and
Mapping transactions to entry nodes.

- The paper notes that TOR would protect against this,

## Stop selling spyware to despotic regimes, beg MEPs

- It has recently been been revealed that Regin super-spyware was used to successfully hack Belgian telco company Belgacom as far back as 2010. Belgacom counts the European Parliament and the European Commission among its customers

- Should control and sanctions come into play only after the fact or should licences be applied for? Personally I would like to see more licences, she said.

## Debian Forked Over Systemd

- Veteran Unix Admin" collective has announced that the fork of Debian will proceed as a result of the recent systemd controversy.

- The reasons put forward are not just technical; included is a letter of endorsement by Debian Developer Roger Leigh mentioning that "people rely on Debian for their jobs and businesses, their research and their hobbies. It's not a playground for such radical experimentation."

- Devuan," pronounced "DevOne.

## Economic Failures of HTTPS Encryption

- Interesting paper: Security Collapse of the HTTPS Market.

- the security of the entire ecosystem suffers if any of the hundreds of CAs is compromised (weakest link);

- browsers are unable to revoke trust in major CAs (too big to fail)

- CAs manage to conceal security incidents (information asymmetry);

- ultimately customers and end users bear the liability and damages of security incidents (negative externalities).

## Clarificiation on the IP Address Security in Dropbox Case

- In the judge's ruling, he trivially rejected some arguments that the county had made, determining for example that IP addresses by themselves were not "data processing software" (duh).

- A judge rules that a county has to turn over the IP addresses that were used to access a county mayor's Dropbox account, stating that there is no valid security-related reason why the IP addresses should be exempt from a public records request.

## Tor Weekly News  November 26th, 2014

- a new authority named longclaw was brought online by the autonomous tech collective Riseup

- Tom Ritter drafted a proposal exploring methods a hidden service operator might use to prove to certificate authorities that they control the services private key when requesting SSL certificates.

- Libertas also scanned a large number of currently-running Tor relays to check which ssh access authentication methods their servers supported, finding 2051 relays that still permitted password-based ssh authentication.

## Say hi to the new GetTor

- GetTor is a program that serves Tor Browser over email.

- In highly censored countries (and places) where the Tor Project website is blocked, GetTor would be a convenient way for people to get access to Tor Browser.

- Tor Browser started to get larger in size (over 25 MB), to the point where it wasn't longer possible to send it via most email providers.

- The idea consisted on uploading Tor Browser to the cloud (Dropbox)

## Android Settings Pendingintent Leak

- In Android <5.0 (and maybe >= 4.0), Settings application leaks Pendingintent with a blank base intent (neither the component nor the action is explicitly set) to third party application, bad app can use this to broadcast intent with the same permissions and identity of the Settings application, which runs as SYSTEM uid. Thus bad app can broadcast sensitive intent with the permission of SYSTEM.

- The vulnerability exists in the AddAccountSettings.java in the Settings app

- "By giving a PendingIntent to another application, you are granting it the right to perform the operation you have specified as if the other application was yourself (with the same permissions and identity). As such, you should be careful about how you build the PendingIntent: almost always, for example, the base Intent you supply should have the component name explicitly set to one of your own components, to ensure it is ultimately sent there and nowhere else."

## Android SMS Resend

- In Android <5.0, an unprivileged app can resend all the SMS stored in the user's phone to their corresponding recipients or senders (without user interaction).

- No matter whether these SMS are sent to or received from other people. This may leads to undesired cost to user.

- Even the worse, since Android also allow unprivileged app to create draft SMS, combined with this trick, bad app can send any SMS without privilege requirement.

- Intent intent= new Intent("com.android.mms.transaction.MESSAGE_SENT");
intent.setData(Uri.parse("content://sms"));
intent.setClassName("com.android.mms", "com.android.mms.transaction.SmsReceiver");
sendOrderedBroadcast(intent,null,null,null,SmsManager.RESULT_ERROR_RADIO_OFF,null,null);

## Bitcoin Not That Anonymous Afterall

- One of the big advantages touted by Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) was always the anonymity of the transactions, yes you can track a wallet address and see the transaction history. But theres no real way to link that wallet address to a real person (so we thought).

- It seems like 11% of Bitcoin transactions can be unmasked fairly easily, without any sign that its happening. Unmasking in this context meaning linking the transaction in the blockchain to a public IP address.

- 1,500 per for servers and traffic charges should be enough to start unmasking users addresses with as much as 60 per cent accuracy.

- If an attacker needed to be stealthy, their success rate would drop to 11 per cent.

- Obviously using something like TOR could protect against this,

- In a concrete example, an attacker with a few GB of storage and no more than 50 connections to each Bitcoin server can disclose the senders IP address in 11 per cent of all transactions generated in the Bitcoin network, the paper claims.

## Evil 32: Check Your GPG Fingerprints

- Key servers do not use transport encryption (e.g. SSL) and GPG does not verify keys received when using --recv-keys leaving communicaiton with key servers vulnerable to MITM

- GPG assumes you have manually checked your keys with --fingerprint.

- Stop using 32bit key ids

It takes 4 seconds to generate a colliding 32bit key id on a GPU (using scallion).

- , a key is requested with its 32bit key id. The key server has two keys with the specified key id and GPG imports both keys. It is easy to generate and publish a key that looks identical if you only use 32 bits when specifying a key.

- https://github.com/lachesis/scallion.

- The key server which holds the cloned keys is available at http://pgp.evil32.com.

- If you specify a key id or fingerprint when using --recv-keys GPG should verify that the key/keys returned by the key server actually have the key id or fingerprint you requested.

## U.K. police force accidentally admits it spied on journalists

- used controversial anti-terror laws to spy on journalists who had not committed any crimes.

- used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) to obtain telecoms data while searching for a journalists source,

- RIPA, which regulates how authorities can intercept and monitor communications

- In another incident, a local council used RIPA to follow and spy on a journalist meeting a source at a cafe as she investigated allegations of wrongdoing within the councils environmental services department, ultimately scuppering her investigation.

## CoreOS

- Rocket is a new container runtime, designed for composability, security, and speed

- Docker now is building tools for launching cloud servers, systems for clustering, and a wide range of functions: building images, running images, uploading, downloading, and eventually even overlay networking, all compiled into one monolithic binary running primarily as root on your server

- It is not becoming the simple composable building block we had envisioned.

- Rocket is a command line tool, rkt, for running App Containers.

- App Container Image: definition of a signed/encrypted tgz that includes all the bits to run an app container.

- App Container Runtime: definition of the environment the running app container should be given.

- App Container Discovery: a federated protocol for finding and downloading an app container image.

- simple names like coreos.com/etcd, allowing organizations to federate their downloads without running their own registry.

- Rocket is an alternative to the Docker runtime, designed for server environments with the most rigorous security and production requirements

- the Docker process model - where everything runs through a central daemon - is fundamentally flawed

- We cannot in good faith continue to support Dockers broken security model without addressing these issues.

## PGPy v0.3.0 Released

- Most of the existing options fell into one of two categories:

A direct Popen wrapper around the gpg command-line binary
A wrapper around GPGME, which is a gpg command-line binary wrapping library written in C

- end result is a package that can accomplish a lot in very few lines of code.

- import pgpy

my_privkey = pgpy.PGPKey.from_file("path/to/my/privatekey.asc")

with my_privkey.unlock("sooper_s3kret"), open("path/to/document", 'r') as document:
    doc_sig = my_privkey.sign(document.read())

with open("path/to/document.sig", 'w') as dsf:
    dsf.write(str(doc_sig))

- In just 5 lines of code, we have loaded a private key, unlocked it using a passphrase, signed a document, and then saved the new signature to the disk.

- .The latest version can always be installed from PyPI using pip, and I am also working on getting packages for several Linux distributions into their repositories

- PGPy 0.3.0 is not yet a complete implementation of the OpenPGP specification
