## In Search Of A Healthy Gut, One Man Turned To An Extreme DIY Fecal Transplant

-  In Search Of A Healthy Gut, One Man Turned To An Extreme DIY Fecal Transplant  (theverge.com) 

- Josiah Zayner writes: Arielle Duhaime-Ross at The Verge followed Dr. Josiah Zayner, a former Scientist at NASA turned BioHacker, as he attempted the first ever full-body microbiome transplant.

- She writes "Over the course of the next four days, Zayner would attempt to eradicate the trillions of microbes that lived on and inside his body -- organisms that helped him digest food, produce vitamins and enzymes, and protected his body from other, more dangerous bacteria.

- Ruthlessly and methodically, he would try to render himself into a biological blank slate.

- Then, he would inoculate himself with a friend's microbes -- a procedure he refers to as a 'microbiome transplant.

## Serious ImageMagick Zero-Day Vulnerabilities  ImageTragick?

- At least this time its pretty dangerous, a bunch of ImageMagick Zero-Day vulnerabilities have been announced including one that can leave you susceptible to remote code execution.

- Of course if youre already smart and using a third party service to do it like Cloudinary or ImgIX  you are safe. A wildly popular software tool used by websites to process peoples photos can be exploited to execute malicious code on servers and leak server-side files. Security bugs in the software are apparently being exploited in the wild right now to compromise at-risk systems.

- Patches to address the vulnerabilities are available in the latest source code  but are incomplete and have not been officially released, were told. Whenever you upload a profile photo, a gallery of snaps, or a silly meme to a website, theres an extremely high chance that the site is using ImageMagick, an open-source collection of image processing tools, to resize, crop and tweak the pictures. By feeding booby-trapped data  such as a poisoned selfie  to web services using ImageMagick, it may be possible to execute malicious code on the websites server.

- From there hackers can start infiltrating the system to steal secrets, snoop on peoples accounts, and so on.  Source: The Register 

- It seems like the details leaked out before the proper patches could be developed, tested and rolled out  they are expected to come this weekend though. The flaw itself somehow seems to be related to these insecure delegates used by ImageMagick. How to Protect against it 1.

## NIST Starts Planning for Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Last year, the NSA announced its plans for transitioning to cryptography that is resistant to a quantum computer.

- A key part of this effort will be an open collaboration with the public, which will be invited to devise and vet cryptographic methods that -- to the best of experts' knowledge -- will be resistant to quantum attack.

- NIST plans to launch this collaboration formally sometime in the next few months, but in general, Moody says it will resemble past competitions such as the one for developing the SHA-3 hash algorithm, used in part for authenticating digital messages.

- The report rightly states that we're okay in the symmetric cryptography world; the key lengths are long enough.

- NIST has done an excellent job with their previous cryptographic standards, giving us a couple of good, strong, well-reviewed, and patent-free algorithms.

## Boffins achieve 'breakthrough' in random number generation

- Researchers have devised a method of generating random numbers that could shake up computer encryption. University of Texas computer science professor David Zuckerman and PhD student Eshan Chattopadhyay have found that a "high-quality" random number could be generated by combining two "low-quality" random sources.  

- You can read their report, Explicit Two-Source Extractors and Resilient Functions, here. Random number generation is used for a variety of applications including cryptography and scientific modelling. Zuckerman is quoted in Threatpost saying: "We show that if you have two low-quality random sources  lower-quality sources are much easier to come by  two sources that are independent and have no correlations between them, you can combine them in a way to produce a high-quality random number.

- Low-quality sources are less random and more vulnerable to security breaches if they are used in encryption. Cryptographic algorithms attempt to keep information secret by transforming it into a stream of random numbers, making it unintelligible.

- Their paper has caught the attention of other academics worldwide who have described the research as "pulse-quickening" and "a breakthrough in theoretical computer science.

- " Zuckerman and Chattopadhyay will present their paper at the Symposium on Theory of Computing in June.

## Anti-Choice Groups Use Smartphone Surveillance to Target 'Abortion-Minded Women' During Clinic Visits - Rewire

- He put together PowerPoint presentations touting his capabilities, and sent them to groups he thought would be interested in reaching abortion-minded women, to use anti-choice parlance. Before long, hed been hired by RealOptions, a network of crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) in Northern California, as well as by the evangelical adoption agency Bethany Christian Services. Flynns endeavors quickly won him attention in the anti-choice world.

- Marketers likely know your age, gender, occupation, education level, marital status, andif you have GPS enabled on your phone and are logged into apps that track youwhere you live, work, and travel. What Flynn realized is that he could use the same technologies to infer that a woman might be seeking an abortion, and to target her for ads from anti-choice groups. We can reach every Planned Parenthood in the U.S., he wrote in a PowerPoint display sent to potential clients in February.

- The chain has faced accusations of pressuring birth moms to continue pregnancies against their will, of abandoning mothers who change their minds and decide not to go through with adoptions, and other abuses. The social worker who received Flynns pitch deck told Rewire she was alarmed that Flynn had succeeded in reaching so many women on behalf of his anti-choice clients. Hes doing it and its working and its probably really impacting human trajectories, she said.

- RealOptions in the San Jose area is presently targeting colleges and medical centers without issue. In the absence of robust legal limitations in the United States, advertisers have organized into self-regulatory bodies to police themselves, acutely conscious that examples of egregious privacy violations could spark a public backlash, and lead consumers to block ads and to opt out of targeted marketing. Lindsay Hutter, a spokesperson from the Direct Marketing Association (DMA)a New York-based group that represents direct marketerssaid in an email statement to Rewire: A key pillar of DMAs work is to ensure that data-driven marketers conduct their work on an ethical basis, respecting the private information of consumers.

- The number of young women identifying with socialist principles suggests many potential readers would appreciate an explicit discussion of alternatives to capitalist feminismbeyond equal pay, what about basic income?but Zeisler largely avoids this conversation, instead alluding more broadly to the need for a post-marketplace-feminism world. In the end, the books greatest weakness is that it sidelines todays grassroots feminist and intersectional social movements, many of which oppose capitalism.

## EFF Applauds Jury Verdict in Favor of Fair Use in Oracle V. Google

- This verdict comes after an earlier district court opinion finding the API labels in question uncopyrightable was reversed by the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. The Google verdict is an an important validation of the idea that developing interoperable software need not require permission or a license.

- As Google attorney Robert Van Nest said in his closing arguments, the law expressly endorses fair useit's a right, not an "excuse," as Oracle attorneys had claimed. Still, the fair use victory is bittersweet.

- The Federal Circuit decision to reverse that opinion was not just wrong but dangerous.

- While developers of interoperable software can take some comfort in the fact that reimplementation may be fair use, a simpler and fairer solution would simply have been to recognize API labels as a system or method of operation not restricted by copyright. The case is not yet closed.

- Oracle has announced that it will appeal the decisionat which point it will go back to the Federal Circuit, with a reported $9 billion still on the line.

## 12 more banks now being investigated over Bangladeshi SWIFT heist

- The investigation into the attempted $1 billion electronic heist at the Central Bank of Bangladesh has expanded to as many as 12 more banks that all use the SWIFT payment network. Security firm FireEye, investigating the hack, has been contacted by numerous other banks, including some in New Zealand and the Philippines.

- While most of the attempted transfers in the original heist were canceled, some $81 million was sent to the Philippines and subsequently laundered through casinos.

- The SWIFT organization in a statement said that some of these reports may be false positives and that banks should rigorously review their computing environments to look for hackers. Symantec, meanwhile, has corroborated earlier claims from BAE Systems that the hackers that stole from the Bangladesh Bank are linked to the hackers that have attacked targets in the US and South Korea since 2009 and that hacked Sony Pictures in 2014.

- The FBI claimed that those hackers were North Korean.

- Symantec's rationale is the same as that of BAE; malware found at the bank, Sony, and other victims, all appears to share common code for securely deleting files to cover its tracks. The continuing evidence of malicious access to the SWIFT network is putting increasing pressure on the industry-owned organization.

## Android Is 'Fair Use' As Google Beats Oracle In $9 Billion Lawsuit

- infernalC writes: Ars Technica is reporting that the verdict is in, and that the jury decided that Google's duplication of several Java interfaces is fair use. Ars Technica writes that Google's Android OS does not infringe upon Oracle-owned copyrights because its re-implementation of 37 Java APIs is protected by "fair use."

- The jury unanimously answered "yes" in response to whether or not Google's use of Java APIs was a "fair use" under copyright law.

- "Google's win somewhat softens the blow to software developers who previously thought programming language APIs were free to use," Ars Technica writes.

- "It's still the case that APIs can be protected by copyright under the law of at least one appeals court.

- However, the first high-profile attempt to control APIs with copyright law has now been stymied by a "fair use" defense."

## Malicious Android apps slip into Google Play, top third party charts

- Malicious Android applications have bypassed Google's Play store security checks to enslave infected devices into distributed denial of service attack, advertising fraud, and spam botnets. The apps are legitimate games that in some stores outside of Google Play have made it to highly-contested top free games charts.  

- Checkpoint malware men Andrey Polkovnichenko and Oren Koriat say the malware family they dubbed Viking Horde, thanks to the chief offending game Viking Jump, varies depending on the capabilities of the infected phone. "Perhaps the most dangerous functionality is the update mechanism [which] allows downloading and executing any remote code on the device," the pair say. "The botnet created by the attackers spread worldwide to users from various targeted countries.

- " A series of sought permissions has lead to user suspicion and subsequent low-ranking on the Google Play store. The apps will ask for admin rights and root permissions on rooted devices which, if granted, will grant the malware persistence and make it difficult to remove. Malicious components are installed (either internally or on an SD card) while the game boots.

- From there, a link to a command and control server is established where information about the infected phone is sent, and attackers can return commands. 

- Credit Checkpoint.  Most phones are used in fraudulent advertisement clicks generating revenue for the attackers. Devices running the modern Marshmallow or Lollipop Android operating systems will need to grant the app a series of individual permissions making compromise more difficult. Users of rooted phones will also need to grant the malware explicit root rights, a request which is highly uncommon for benign games. Older Android Kitkat devices, which run on 32 per cent of all devices compared to the most popular Android version, Lollipop, on 35 per cent, are much more susceptible to compromise thanks to a weaker permission system that is prone to mindless user approval. This may go some way to explain the malware's success in Russia where 44 per cent of infections are traced.

## Android platform engineer on application architecture

- It is true, because of the various helpers built around content providers, this can be an easy way to put data in a SQLite database and use it to populate UI elements like a ListView.

- Another company I don't want to mention has unity support for their devices but also has a very good documentation on 3d rendering topics to the point every search on google including "android" and "opengl es" returned the competitor's website with their (detailed) objective c stuff.

- There's nothing.Games are maybe a small fraction of the whole play store lineup, maybe the independent devs don't bring a lot of money compared to the next clash of clans or FIFA.

- Why pushing another company engine on your official documentation while there are a lot of topics not covered at all for people that want to learn to do things their own way?Quite disappointing because I thought google was promoting diversity not some kind of totalitarian philosophy where everybody has to download the same library not having a clue about how stuff really works, and those who don't comply will be ignored.

- For the gaming / mid level stuff there's always C / NDK, but i don't want to have to worry about keep updating my other Dalvik / ART apps just to be compatible with the newest Android version running on OpenJDK or whatever other contraption Google comes out with.

## SQL Injection Fools Traffic Camera

-  Typical speed camera traps have built-in OCR software that is used to recognize license plates.

- A clever hacker decided to see if he could defeat the system by using SQL Injection... The basic premise of this hack is that the hacker has created a simple SQL statement which will hopefully cause the database to delete any record of his license plate.

- is because while you would think a traffic camera is only taught to recognize the license plate characters, the developers of the third-party image recognition software simply digitize the entire thing  recognizing any and all of the characters present.

- While its certainly clever, were pretty sure youll still get pulled over and questioned  but at least its not as extreme as building a flashbulb array to blind traffic cameras... What do you guys think?

- This image has been floating around the net for a few years now  if anyone knows the original story let us know!

## Secure Hardware vs. Open Source | Yubico

- There are a few problems with that:  There is an inverse relationship between making a chip open and achieving security certifications, such as Common Criteria.

- Given the high costs to achieve and maintain certification and the procedural hassle, it is quite easy to understand the current state of affairs. Lets for a moment return to the question of the YubiKey NEO and why we decided to remove the ability to manage the applets.

- We dont charge for it, but given the paperwork required, we need to have a compelling business case in order to justify the effort. Id like to bring up another aspect when it comes to providing integrated products.

- In a software-only open source project, handling a serious issue like that could be as simple as issuing a security bulletin and pushing a fix. Enterprise customers deploying at million-unit scale have engaged independent third parties to review our firmware source code and algorithm implementations, and we would consider this with others of a similar or larger scale (given the extensive load on our engineering team to support such analysis).

- This assumes that both have been subject to third-party review in a similar fashion.  In conclusion, we want our customers and community to know that we have made conscious choices to some quite complex questions and that, in the end, we have landed with some sensible compromises.

## Hidden Microphones Part of Government Surveillance Program in the Bay Area

- 

- OAKLAND (CBS SF)  Hidden microphones that are part of a clandestine government surveillance program that has been operating around the Bay Area has been exposed. Imagine standing at a bus stop, talking to your friend and having your conversation recorded without you knowing.

- It happens all the time, and the FBI doesnt even need a warrant to do it. Federal agents are planting microphones to secretly record conversations. Jeff Harp, a KPIX 5 security analyst and former FBI special agent said, They put microphones under rocks, they put microphones in trees, they plant microphones in equipment.

- I mean, theres microphones that are planted in places that people dont think about, because thats the intent! FBI agents hid microphones inside light fixtures and at a bus stop outside the Oakland Courthouse without a warrant to record conversations, between March 2010 and January 2011. Federal authorities are trying to prove real estate investors in San Mateo and Alameda counties are guilty of bid rigging and fraud and used these recordings as evidence. Harp said, An agent cant just go out and grab a recording device and plant it somewhere without authorization from a supervisor or special agent in charge. The lawyer for one of the accused real estate investors who will ask the judge to throw out the recordings, told KPIX 5 News that, Speaking in a public place does not mean that the individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy...private communication in a public place qualifies as a protected oral communication... and therefore may not be intercepted without judicial authorization. Harp says that if youre going to conduct criminal activity, do it in the privacy of your own home.

- He says that was the original intention of the Fourth Amendment, but its up to the judge to interpret it.

## Identity Startup Netki to Launch SSL Certificate for Blockchain

- Involved in this process are protocols including the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), as well as certificate authorities (CAs), entities that issue digital certificates to organizations or individuals. Now, digital identity startup Netki has announced that it is releasing what it considers to be the first digital identity certificate akin to the SSL for the blockchain in a bid to replicate both this technology and its top-lever services on the blockchain. In interview, CEO and co-founder Justin Newton expanded on the vision for the product, which follows a wallet naming service it introduced last year. He explained: "What we did is we took a look at the ecosystem and saw that everyone was doing a good job of doing KYC (know your customer) on their own customers, but blockchains in general dont have a really great way of knowing who your counterparty is.

- In particular, Newton cited FinCEN's travel rule, which "requires all financial institutions to pass on certain information to the next financial institution, in certain funds transmittals involving more than one financial institution". Under the travel rule, the identities of all participants involved in digital currency transfers greater than $3,000, including the money service businesses (MSBs) such as wallet providers and exchanges and the actual sender and receiver of the funds, must be known. Part of the problem is that MSBs have to worry about sending money to nations that are sanctioned under the auspices of the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).

- The first is that current companies could deal with significant regulatory risk. "Its also preventing traditional financial institutions from being able to connect or interact with the open blockchain," he argued. Building on BIP70 On the bitcoin network today, a piece of code called BIP70 handles a similar function, allowing spenders to obtain signed payment details from those who receive transactions. But, part of the problem is that BIP70 wasnt built to support the rules required by FinCEN for these large transactions, Netki argues.  In a presentation at Consensus 2016, Newton explained that the existing payment flow, BIP70, only allows for a certificate from the wallet provider of the recipient to be sent.

- " Essentially, both the sender and receiver of the payment request  and their corresponding MSBs  can voluntarily hand over the necessary identification to ensure that all parties involved are legally allowed to send and receive payment. Newton explained that BIP75 is already implemented in Netkis open-source software, Addressimo, and that he expects that implementation in wallet software to commence over the next few months. A blockchain-agnostic certificate authority The second problem that BIP75 solves allows for Netki and other service providers is ensuring user privacy. According to the authors, BIP75 "encrypts the payment request that is returned, before handing it off to the SSL/TLS layer to prevent man in the middle viewing of the Payment Request details". This point is critical for the whole process, because Netki doesnt believe that the identification should actually be on the public ledger. Newton explained: "We wanted to be sure that this all happened at the application layer rather than the blockchain protocol layer because we didnt think it was right to build any identity into an open permissionless network.

- This is already an internationally recognized form of digital identity," Newton said. According to a white paper published by Entrust, "the bridge CA provides trust paths between principal Certification Authorities for trust domain PKIs [public key infrastructures]". In the case of the Federal Bridge, "it does not provide a root of trust, but instead links together existing trust infrastructures". By building on top of the Federal Bridge CA, MSBs dont have to worry about whether the certificate provided by Netki is acceptable from a regulatory perspective because they already have years of experience using it for their businesses. While Newton couldnt yet offer a precise cost for the certificate, he did suggest that the two-year certificate for validated identity wouldnt be cost prohibitive for individuals or their MSBs. "In most cases, where a MSB is involved, we anticipate that the cost wont show up as a direct cost for the consumer.

## Insider trading hacker pleads guilty to p0wning press releases

- 

- A Ukrainian ne'er-do-well who broke into market computers for an insider trading scheme has entered a guilty plea in the US. The 28-year-old, Vadym Iermolovych, has put his hands up to three charges  conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and aggravated identity theft.  

- The US Department of Justice says he netted a stunning US$30 million for his efforts. Iermolovych was part of a gang that made its way into the networks of Marketwired, PR Newswire and Business Wire, and used their access to peruse unpublished press releases.

- That information was then passed to a network of securities traders. Companies the group traded included Align Technology, Caterpillar, Hewlett Packard, Home Depot, Panera Bread and Verisign. Iermolovych and his accomplices used phishing and SQL injection to compromise the newswires' networks, the DoJ release says. Others charged in relation to the hacks included Ukrainians Ivan Turchynov, Oleksandr Ieremenko and Pavel Dubovoy; Arkadiy Dubovoy and Igor Dubovoy, who lived in the US state of Georgia when they were charged. Arkadiy Dubovoy and Igor Dubovoy entered their own guilty pleas earlier this year. The four security traders charged for their part in the scheme are Vitaly Korchevsky of Pennsylvania; Vladislav Khalupsky of Brooklyn, New York and the Ukraine; and Leonid Momotok and Alexander Garkusha of Georgia.

- Garkush entered a guilty plea in December 2015. The wire fraud charges carry a maximum 20 years in the slammer.

## Xen exploitation part 1: XSA-105, from nobody to root

- Basically, the kernel detects Xen at boot time if it runs under an hypervisor, and uses paravirtualization extensions called pvops  in this case to be more efficient.

- ================= The emulation of the instructions HLT, LGDT, LIDT, and LMSW fails to perform supervisor mode permission checks.

- The third proposition of the advisory seems to be the easiest to implement and this is the solution adopted by Andrei Lutas .  Lutas has already provided a remarkable job explaining the vulnerable code in his paper , if you need explanations about those, definitely read his paper.   Exploitation Among the vulnerable instructions, only two of them could lead to a potential privilege escalation: lgdt and lidt.

- Exiting the far call routine is done with a retf instruction. A demonstration is available here: asciinema, and the full exploit can be downloaded here: xsa105_exploit.tar.gz.     Conclusion This vulnerability allows a privilege escalation on a HVM guest with more than one CPU.

- We use the call gate mechanism in order to execute arbitrary code while Andrei Lutas  exploited an interrupt handler.

## FOURTH bank hit by SWIFT hackers

- A fourth bank, this time in the Philippines, has been attacked by hackers targeting the SWIFT inter-bank transfer system. Security researchers at Symantec reckon the same group blamed for the infamous $81m Bangladesh central bank mega-heist back in February also mounted an earlier assault in the Philippines last year, itself part of a growing litany of assaults.  

- This commonality of tactics, techniques and procedures has allowed the security firm to point the finger of blame for the SWIFT bank hacks towards the same hackers who ransacked Sony Pictures network two years ago. Symantec believes distinctive code shared between families and the fact that Backdoor.Contopee was being used in limited targeted attacks against financial institutions in the region, means these tools can be attributed to the same group.

- The group was linked to Backdoor.Destover, a highly destructive Trojan that was the subject of an FBI warning after it was used in an attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment.

- The FBI concluded that the North Korean government was responsible for this attack. How deep does the rabbit hole go? Evidence is emerging that the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecom) attacks began as far back as October 2015 when the Philippines bank was first hit, two months prior to the discovery of the failed attack on Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam. Some of the tools used against the Philippines bank share code similarities with malware used in historic attacks linked to a threat group known as Lazarus, the group behind the Sony Pictures breach.

- The US government has consistently blamed North Korea for the Sony Pictures hack back in November 2014. Symantecs findings - which are backed up by earlier research by BAE systems - point the finger of blame for a growing run of attacks against banks worldwide towards North Korea. Stung by the growing catalogue of malfeasance, SWIFT chief exec Gottfried Leibbrandt announced security upgrades and better information sharing for its inter-bank transfer system earlier this week.

- Once again, a security researcher has found himself facing possible prosecution under a federal statute known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

- His crime, according to a dental-industry software company, was accessing what had been left publicly available on the open Internet.

- Shafer opened the door to find what he estimated to be 12 to 15 FBI agents. One was pointing a big green assault weapon at me, Shafer told the Daily Dot, and the babys crib was only feet from the door.

- Shafer was taken outside, still in his boxer shorts, still not knowing what was going on or why.

## Hacker Phineas Fisher is Trying To Start a 'Hack Back' Political Movement

- " For some, thanks to his targeted attacks and sophisticated political views, Phineas Fisher is quickly becoming the most influential hacktivist of the last few years. In response to his most recent hack where he released a 39-minute how-to video showing how to strip data from targeted websites, specifically a website of the Catalan police union, Phineas Fisher told Motherboard, "Everything doesn't have to be big.

- I wanted to strike a small blow at the system, teach a bit of hacking with the video, and inspire people to take action."

- Biella Coleman, professor at McGill University in Montreal, believes Phineas Fisher has a good chance of inspiring a new generation of hacktivists and "setting the stage for other hackers to follow in his footsteps."

- She says he has been better at choosing targets and justifying his actions with more rounded and sophisticated political and ethical views than Anonymous and LulzSec-inspired hackers.

- Phineas Fisher told Motherboard, "I don't want to be the lone hacker fighting the system.

- In Google's Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository, a new device tree recently popped up for the Raspberry Pi 3.

- It's rare to see a non-Google device in AOSP, so it seems Google has taken quite a shine to the tiny computer.

- With officially supported source code, it should be much easier for hackers to get Android up and running on the Pi 3.

## Microsoft criticized for changing the pop-up box encouraging users to upgrade

-       24 May 2016  From the section Technology  

- Microsoft has faced criticism for changing the pop-up box encouraging Windows users to upgrade to Windows 10.

- Clicking the cross in the top-right hand corner of the pop-up box now agrees to a scheduled upgrade rather than rejecting it.This has caused confusion as clicking the cross typically closes a pop-up notification.The upgrade could still be cancelled when the scheduled time for it to begin appeared, Microsoft said.The change occurred because the update is now labelled "recommended" and many people have their PCs configured to accept recommended updates for security reasons.

-  This means dismissing the box does not dismiss the update.Brad Chacos, senior editor at the PC World website, described it as a "nasty trick"."Deploying these dirty tricks only frustrates long-time Windows users who have very valid reasons to stick with operating systems they already know and love," he wrote.                                                                                                    Microsoft said: "With the free Windows 10 upgrade offer ending on 29 July, we want to help people upgrade to the best version of Windows."As we shared in October, Windows 10 will be offered as a 'recommended' update for Windows 7 and 8.1 customers whose Windows Update settings are configured to accept 'recommended' updates.

- "Customers can choose to accept or decline the Windows 10 upgrade.

## SWIFT CEO promises security improvements

- The head of the SWIFT financial network has put forward a five-part plan to improve security after its systems were the focus of several cyberattacks. Gottfried Leibbrandt gave a keynote on Tuesday at a financial services conference in Brussels and promised the organization would work harder to ensure that incidents like last month's theft of $81m from Bangladesh's central bank were not possible in future.  

- " Hackers had managed to gain access to Bangladesh Bank's central keys and use them through the SWIFT international money system to divert funds.

- From SWIFT's perspective the issue lies with the bank: their systems had been compromised. The organization responded aggressively to suggestions that it was in some way responsible for the theft, putting out an announcement that read in part: "SWIFT rejects the false, inaccurate and misleading allegations made by Bangladesh Bank and Bangladesh Police's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officials to Reuters.

- Introduce certification requirements for third-party providers.  Or, in other words, do what the organization should have done as part of its job several years ago. Ummm But before you get too excited about Leibbrandt's sudden understanding of the modern world, his speech revealed a continued misunderstanding of modern financial crime. "Back before mainframes, ATMs, mobile banking and PCs, it was all about men and guns," he said.

- " If he imagines that the kind of people that are breaking into a central bank, grabbing authorization keys, using SWIFT networks against it even to the extent of adjusting printed reports to hide fraudulent transfers, and then moving the money to accounts that can't be got at are "men in hoodies," he continues to massively underestimate the modern cybercriminal. There was some self-awareness however.

## Coinbase Co-founder: Ethereum Is the Forefront of Digital Currency

- We are finally getting rapid iteration at the app layer. In one early example, people have designed a decentralized organization (The DAO)  a company whose heart is code and peripheral operations are run by humans, rather than the other way around  that has raised $150m so far in the largest crowdfunding ever.To be clear, I dont think this needs to be a contest between Bitcoin vs. Ethereum and Coinbase plans to strongly support both.

- Bitcoin is still orders of magnitude smaller than the major financial networks of the world at ~$200m/day in transaction volume (Visa $18 billion/day, SWIFT wire $5 trillion/day) and ~10 million users (5 billion in banks).

- But some probably will work, and they will be important  moving to proof of stake and eliminating physical mining being one of the most promising.Ethereum is making faster and more consistent technical progress on the core protocolIn Bitcoin, we have mostly been stuck on the block size debate for the last year and a half.

- Like any project that has success, its inevitable to hit bumps as peoples vested interests get bigger.Ethereum allows you to do more than you currently can in Bitcoin, and that brings increased regulatory risk.

- I believe this risk is manageable because there would be extensive testing beforehand.Scaling the network is harder when it supports mini programs in addition to basic transaction processing.

## Certified Canarytokens: Alerts from Signed Windows Binaries and Office Documents

-  Canarytokens is our exploration of light-weight ways to detect when something bad has happened on the inside a network.

- We built an extensible server for receiving alerts from passive tokens that are left lying around.

- We've automated this by offloading the signing to the Apache POI library in a Java program.

- What the Office document and executable signings point to, is a more generic technique for alerting on signature (and certificate) validation.

- This a more notable alerting primitive and is likely more stable than application quirks given that URL-fetching extensions are enshrined in certificate standards.

## Apple Rehires Jon Callas, Cofounder of PGP, Silent Circle and Blackphone

- Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice asked federal judges in California and New York to force Apple to break into locked iPhones, including one that was used by one of the shooters in last year's attacks in San Bernardino, California.The cases were dropped after the authorities managed to access the iPhones without Apple's help, but the political debate over encrypted technology continues.

- The FBI and law enforcement maintain that tech companies need to help the government hunt criminals.

- Apple and other  tech companies say that requiring them to circumvent their own encryption would undermine the security of their products and make them more vulnerable to malicious hackers.

- But he has also said he supports a compromise proposal under which law enforcement officials with a court order can take advantage of undisclosed software vulnerabilities to hack into tech systems, as long as they disclose the vulnerabilities afterwards so they can be patched."Jon is someone who has deep appreciation of all sides of the story," said Phil Dunkelberger, who was chief executive of PGP Corp and its predecessor PGP Inc, which invented a system for securing email.

- Companies including Facebook Inc's (FB.O) WhatsApp messaging service have also implemented encryption that makes it harder for law enforcement to access digital information.

## Windows 10 Upgrade Activates By Clicking Red X Close Button In Prompt Message

-  Windows 10 Upgrade Activates By Clicking Red X Close Button In Prompt Message  (bbc.co.uk) 

- Reader Raging Bool writes: In a move guaranteed to annoy many people, Microsoft has "jumped the shark" on encouraging users to upgrade to Windows 10.

- And this has caused confusion as typically clicking a red cross closes a pop-up notification.

- The upgrade could still be cancelled, when the scheduled time for it to begin appeared, Microsoft said The change occurred because the update is now labelled "recommended" and many people have their PCs configured to accept recommended updates for security reasons.

- This means dismissing the box does not dismiss the update.Brad Chacos, senior editor at the PC World wrote about this incident over the weekend, and described it as a "nasty trick".

## Mission: Montreal! (Building the Next Generation of Onion Services)

-  Tor developers finished implementing the protocol several months ago, and since then we've been reviewing, auditing, and testing the code.  As far as we know, a distributed random generation system like this has never been deployed before on the Internet.

- We had our nodes run ancient Tor versions, perform random chaotic behaviors, disappear and never come back, etc.  This helped us detect various bugs and edge cases.

- We improved the clarity of the specification of proposal 224 and fixed inconsistencies and errors in the text (see latest prop224 commits).

- We also discussed modifications to the Tor Browser Bundle that could improve the user experience of long onion addresses.

-  All in all, we got crazy amounts of work done and we all have our hands full for months to come. Finally, if you find these sort of hackfests exciting and you would like to host or sponsor one, don't hesitate to get in touch with us!

## Ethereum Contracts Are Going to Be Candy for Hackers

-  This raises a sort of rhetorical question for me; if contracts are immutable and permanent, and error rates do not approach zero, what are people signing up for?

-  I have a few suggestions in a later post. A sample contract with some flaws  Ethstick is a kind of pyramid scheme which incentivizes participants (donkeys) to keep depositing money to get the payout (carrot).

- Ethereum blocks come about every 45 seconds; therefore, there is plenty of time for an attacker to calculate out if they would be the paid-out donkey and only trigger the contract with a payment if they are the recipient. This qualifies as a severe bug to my mind.

- It will eventually become a cesspit for attack algorithms trying to beat each-other at the randomness game, which will be kind of fun to watch, I suppose, but it will not be doing the job it promises to do. I would rate it in the middle of code quality that I've seen in the last few days.

- Some popular services, ones with 100s of thousands of dollars flowing through them, are distressingly bad (as in "everyone loses all their money" bad) with no way to mitigate, by design. Mitigation  Some recommendations -- first, I think that it is almost going to be a requirement for all but the simplest contracts that they have some sort of replacement mechanism baked in. I have a few ideas about how this could work, and will write about them later, but one obvious point to make is that the replacement mechanism would need to be trusted by users of the contract.

## Survival analysis of hard disk drive failure data

- Familiar and convenient as they are, these complex electro-mechanical devices are prone to sudden catastrophic failure, which can lead to very unpleasant consequences such as loss of data which was not securely backed up elsewhere.

- As drive capacities grow, new models are released on a regular basis but it takes at least 2 or 3 years of observation of a large number of sample drives under typical field operation conditions before robust conclusions can be drawn on the reliability over time for each new model.  The most recent analysis of about 50,000 hard disks deployed in a commercial on line storage facility over nearly 3 years run by Backblaze is one of the largest published studies and can be viewed at https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-reliability-q3-2015/ and in other Backblaze blogs.

- More sophisticated methods such as Cox proportional hazards models require distributional or other assumptions, but allow adjustment for additional variables such as the kind of storage pod (see the Backblaze blogs), drive capacity, number of platters or other factors of interest.

-   Conclusions:  Other than as a consumer, I don't have any particular expertise on hard disk drives but I have made a successful career out of interpreting large scale data sets using appropriate statistical methods.

- I find the KM analysis much more clear and easy to interpret compared to the simple descriptive statistics presented by Backblaze and I hope they use more appropriate methods going forward.

## 60 per cent of Androids exposed by new attack on mediaserver

- 

- Duo Security researcher Kyle Lady says attackers can compromise more than half of enterprise Android phones by chaining two operating system and chip vulnerabilities. The flaws affect scores of phones on the market from the most popular Lollipop version 5 Android system, second-placed KitKat version 4.4, and the barely-used modern Marshmallow version 6.  

- Some 60 percent of enterprise Android phones are affected based on tests of half a million phones. Affected users can apply a January patch if one is available, although Android handsets other than Nexus units are locked into custom vendor ROMs and as such must hope manufacturers will distribute Google's security updates. About 27 per cent of those devices were Android relics and so old they could not be owned using the attacks. "If an attacker can get a user to run a malicious app on an affected Android device, the attacker can gain complete control over the entire device by exploiting this QSEE vulnerability," Lady says. "This attack requires exploiting some vulnerability in mediaserver, and were assuming that the attacker has one, given how frequently critical or high severity bugs in mediaserver are found and patched. "While the likelihood of getting malicious code onto a device is very low, all it takes is one success to get attack code in the Play Store.

- " Users need to download an attacker's app to be compromised, a gaffe which could be considered game-over regardless of any vulnerabilities in Android. Malware developers are constantly finding success in uploading malicious applications to the Google Play Store, slipping undetected past Mountain View's security checks. From there it exploits functions like accessibility, screen overlay, and root rights.

- The Marshmallow platform is much more hardened than Lollipop and significantly more so than Kitkat. Now Lady (@kylelady) says a Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment (QSEE) vulnerability (CVE-2015-6639) colleague Gal Beniamini (@laginimaineb) reported earlier this month affects scores of enterprise Android phones. Lady says the attacks are not of the heightened risk level of the seemingly-immortal Stagefright vulnerability which can compromise Android phones with little more than a phone number. About one in 200 phones contain an unwanted or malicious application in what could be an indication of the potential effectiveness of Beniamini's attack.

## Google to kill passwords on Android, replace 'em with 'trust scores'

- Google is planning to use trust scores to kill off traditional passwords on Android. The internet giant wants to get rid of password logins, at least for Android apps, by 2017.

- Google's Trust API technology would use a variety of metrics to create a trust score. Factors such as typing speed, vocal inflexions, facial recognition and proximity to familiar Bluetooth devices and Wi-Fi hotspots would be used to calculate the score. Games and basic tools would be run even if only a low trust score was achieved, while more sensitive apps such as banking and webmail would need the biometric and location-based data to line up and provide a high score. This implies that a device could be unlocked to apps even with a low score, which provides an avenue for more privilege exploitation attacks.

- In contrast, if a passcode is set and forgotten, users are locked out and unable to access their data  in theory.

- It sounds like a trade-off between security and convenience, a classic security equation. On the other hand, Android users typically allows access to all applications on their device without requiring password entry once a device is unlocked. Richard Lack, director of sales EMEA at customer identity management firm Gigya, said Googles plans are welcome as part of a broader push away from passwords which be characterised as a broken technology. The future lies in methods of authentication without passwords, which consumers clearly favour, both in terms of convenience and enhanced security, Lack commented. Biometric authentication is a powerful enabler, allowing businesses smart enough to deploy it to significantly increase rates of registration, gaining data and insight about their customers, while also increasing customer security.

- This is a win/win scenario which sounds the death-knell for awkward and insecure passwords sooner than we may imagine.

## LinkedIn mass hack reveals ... yup, you're all still crap at passwords

- Analysis of passwords from the LinkedIn leak has revealed, should there be any doubt, that users remain terrible at choosing secure login credentials. Last week a black hat hacker using the nickname Peace was revealed as attempting to sell 117 million LinkedIn users' emails and passwords on the dark web.  

- "Peace" wants 5 BTC for the stash, delayed fruits of a well-publicised LinkedIn breach back in 2012. LinkedIn said there is "no indication that this is result of a new security breach" even though the exposure of credentials has increased from a previously admitted 6.5 million records leak to a 117 million torrent.

- The business-focused social network said it intended to apply a password reset to potentially compromised accounts and urged users to enable two-step verification to further protect their LinkedIn accounts. Login credentials - especially to social media sites - are a valuable commodity for black hat hackers.

- 12345678  123456 appears more than a million times (1,135,936 to be precise) in the dump, a long way clear of second-placed LinkedIn (207k).

- All manner of mischief has ensued. Some reports suggest that seemingly benign hackers have begun to hijack the profiles of big name personalities using info gleaned from the dump.

## Vindication for Edward Snowden From a New Player in NSA Whistleblowing Saga

- The Guardian published a stunning new chapter in the saga of NSA whistleblowers on Sunday, revealing a new key player: John Crane, a former assistant inspector general at the Pentagon who was responsible for protecting whistleblowers, then forced to become one himself when the process failed. An article by Mark Hertsgaard, adapted from his new book, Bravehearts: Whistle Blowing in the Age of Snowden, describes how former NSA official Thomas Drake went through proper channels in his attempt to expose civil-liberties violations at the NSA  and was punished for it.

- The article vindicates open-government activists who have long argued that whistleblower protections arent sufficient in the national security realm. It vindicates NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden who, well aware of what happened to Drake, gave up his attempts to go through traditional whistleblower channels  and instead handed over his trove of classified documents directly to journalists. And it adds to the vindication for Drake, who was already a hero in the whistleblowers pantheon for having endured a four-year persecution by the Justice Department that a judge called unconscionable. The case against Drake, who was initially charged with 10 felony counts of espionage, famously disintegrated before trial  but not before he was professionally and financially ruined.

- But because he was still working at the NSA, he asked the office to keep his participation anonymous. Now, Hertsgaard writes that Crane alleges that his former colleagues in the inspector generals office revealed Drakes identity to the Justice Department; then they withheld (and perhaps destroyed) evidence after Drake was indicted; finally, they lied about all this to a federal judge. Cranes growing concerns about his offices conduct pushed him to his breaking point, according to Hertsgaard.

- But his supervisors ignored his concerns, gave him the silent treatment, and finally forced him to resign in January 2013. Due to Cranes continued efforts, however, the Department of Justice has opened an investigation into the Department of Defense for its treatment of whistleblowers, and Hertsgaard tells The Intercept that a public report on the results of the investigation is expected next year. Crane brings unprecedented evidence from inside the system that ostensibly protects whistleblowers that the system isnt working.

- He didnt want it to become something personal. For him, it was about whistleblowing, Hertsgaard explained, and the principle that anonymity must be absolutely sacred. Snowden told The Guardian that Drakes persecution was very much on his mind when he decided to go outside normal channels.

## Coinbase Exchange to Rebrand Following Ethereum Trading Launch

-  Bitcoin exchange and wallet service Coinbase is adding support for ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. The addition of Ethereum comes amid rising interest in ether among digital currency traders and the technology platform itself among financial institutions and other enterprises worldwide.

- Later this summer, the company will add support for the digital currency to all Coinbase users. An official announcement is expected to be made Tuesday.

- More recently, Gemini added ether trading pairs to its exchange. According to White, members of the Coinbase team have long stayed apprised of development on Ethereum, largely through conversations with the network's creator, Vitalik Buterin, as well as media reports. Last year, employees took part in multiple Ethereum meetups as part of their research into the digital currency, said White.

- But it wasnt until Microsoft Azure entered the fray that the startup begin to look more closely, said White. The result: Coinbase employees began building services on top of Ethereum, including wallets.

- " Interest in other assets White also suggested that the company was paying close attention to The DAO, a decentralized organization built on top of Ethereum that acts as a funding vehicle for related projects. Specifically, Coinbase employees are keeping a close eye on the tokens associated with The DAO, which are used as both a voting mechanism as well as a method of generating rewards for stakeholders. "Id be remiss to say were not investigating that," said White.

## Study finds that Tylenol reduces empathy

- COLUMBUS, Ohio  When you take acetaminophen to reduce your pain, you may also be decreasing your empathy for both the physical and social aches that other people experience, a new study suggests.Researchers at The Ohio State University found, for example, that when participants who took acetaminophen learned about the misfortunes of others, they thought these individuals experienced less pain and suffering, when compared to those who took no painkiller.These findings suggest other peoples pain doesnt seem as big of a deal to you when youve taken acetaminophen, said Dominik Mischkowski, co-author of the study and a former Ph.D. student at Ohio State, now at the National Institutes of Health.Dominik MischkowskiAcetaminophen can reduce empathy as well as serve as a painkiller. Mischkowski conducted the study with Baldwin Way, who is an assistant professor of psychology and member of the Ohio State Wexner Medical Centers Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research; and Jennifer Crocker, Ohio Eminent Scholar in Social Psychology and professor of psychology at Ohio State.

- Their results were published online in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience.Acetaminophen  the main ingredient in the painkiller Tylenol  is the most common drug ingredient in the United States, found in more than 600 medicines, according to the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade group.Each week about 23 percent of American adults (about 52 million people) use a medicine containing acetaminophen, the CHPA reports.In an earlier study, Way and other colleagues found that acetaminophen also blunts positive emotions like joy.Taken together, the two studies suggest theres a lot we need to learn about one of the most popular over-the-counter drugs in the United States.We dont know why acetaminophen is having these effects, but it is concerning, said Way, the senior author of the study.Empathy is important.

- The students didnt know which group they were in.After waiting one hour for the drug to take effect, the participants read eight short scenarios in which someone suffered some sort of pain.

- They then rated the noise blasts on a scale of 1 (not unpleasant at all) to 10 (extremely unpleasant).They were then asked to imagine how much pain the same noise blasts would cause in another anonymous study participant.Results showed that, when compared to those who took the placebo, participants who took acetaminophen rated the noise blasts as less unpleasant for themselves  and also thought they would be less unpleasant for others.Acetaminophen reduced the pain they felt, but it also reduced their empathy for others who were experiencing the same noise blasts, Mischkowski said.In another part of the experiment, participants met and socialized with each other briefly.

- Those results showed that the same part of the brain was activated in both cases.In light of those results, it is understandable why using Tylenol to reduce your pain may also reduce your ability to feel other peoples pain as well, he said.The researchers are continuing to study how acetaminophen may affect peoples emotions and behavior, Way said.

## Pennsylvania license plate reader SUV camouflaged as Google Street View vehicle

- Image: Dustin Slaughter Update: The Philadelphia Police Department has admitted it owns the truck, and is launching an inquiry into why it was disguised as a Google vehicle.An SUV tucked away in the shadows of the Philadelphia Convention Centers tunnel bears the ubiquitous logo for Google Maps, and mounted on top of the vehicle are two high-powered license plate reader cameras.

- Others, such as Matt Blaze, a University of Pennsylvania computer and information science professor, saw it for what it truly was: a crudely disguised tool for surveillance.

- The use of ALPR is controversial because of its ability to photograph thousands of license plate images per minute, and in doing so, warrantlessly track and store the average persons travel habits.

- In Philly, the police can retain this data for a full year, even though the vast majority of residents are not under investigation.

- When pressed, Cadrecha would not elaborate as to whether the company was concerned or angered that a local agency would be using a vehicle with powerfuland controversialsurveillance technology while masquerading as a street mapping car.

## The Information Age Is Over; Welcome to the Experience Age

- Along with other social networks of its generation, Facebook was built on a principle of the desktop era   accumulation. Accumulation manifests in a digital profile where my identity is the sum of all the information Ive saved   text, photos, videos, web pages.

- On Facebook you type into a status box, add metadata such as your location and select from a hierarchy of emotions for how you feel.

- This information-first approach is also visible in Facebooks feedback mechanisms   six pre-selected reactions with threaded commenting.  By contrast, Snapchat always starts with the camera.

- In the Experience Age, the primary input is visual and the dominant feedback is attention. Today the feedback loop connecting sharing and attention starts and ends on mobile; in the future, it could start with contact lenses and end in VR, for example. The experience stack This reality frames Facebooks recent investments, which bring live video, 360-degree cameras and VR as products all into a single portfolio.

- At the top is the application layer made up of products like Snapchat Live and Periscope.

## Avoiding XSS Detection (payload generator and self-delete code)

-  As any XSSer (one that makes XSS) might know, the script tag is not always available to inject into a XSS hole because its the first thing that will be filtered by developer or an WAF (Web Application Firewall).

- Some techniques are needed to avoid been spotted, from victim to developer or admin investigation. We will examine a reflected XSS scenario.

- Although all the code after # will never be sent to server, thus avoiding any logging, its clear that too much suspicious activity is being done here and an user may spot this. But the worst part is that will not work, at least in Firefox, because the single quotes will be turned into %27 and eval() function will complain about it.

- Theres also the backticks option against parenthesis filtering as we can see here. Even with our efforts, script code can still be discovered.

- But be sure to have it writable by the web server user and save a copy for replacement after deleting. #hack2learn

## Major Remote SSH Security Issue in CoreOS Linux Alpha

- The Alpha was subsequently reverted back to the unaffected previous version (1032.1.0) and hosts configured to receive updates have been patched.

- Ignore this information. Next, force an update by running: $ update_engine_client -update   Fixing Systems that Booted an Affected Version If your host booted an affected version, you should immediately limit network access to SSH and then update CoreOS Linux.

- Reinstalling the system from scratch is the recommended course of action. Basic Forensics The most common users that will exist on a CoreOS machine with valid login shells are operator and core.

- Based on log data from the CoreOS Linux Update Service roughly 3% of online, auto-upgrading, hosts were affected. This issue demonstrates a hole in our test coverage for new releases.

- New vulnerabilities will exist in perpetuity of software development, so we believe that an organizations ability to remediate them quickly is the key to on-going security.

## Symantec antivirus bug allows utter exploitation of memory

- British white hat hacker and Google Project Zero chap Tavis Ormandy is making life miserable for Symantec again: the bug-hunter has turned up an exploitable overflow in the core Symantec Antivirus Engine used in most Symantec and Norton branded Antivirus products. Described here, the problem is in how the antivirus products handle executables compressed using an early version of the Aspack compression tool.  

- If the engine encounters truncated section data  when SizeOfRawData is greater than SizeOfImage  the buffer overflow occurs.

- Ormandy writes: Because Symantec use a filter driver to intercept all system I/O, just emailing a file to a victim or sending them a link is enough to exploit it./blockquote Entertainingly, it's a cross-platform bug that affects Windows, Mac, and *nix platforms.

- Either e-mail or browser attacks will work, Ormandy says, attaching a test case file to his post.

- Ormandy tweeted that Live Update will carry some fixes, while others will require a patch.

## Google Launches 'Gboard' Keyboard For iOS, Featuring Built-In Google Search

- An anonymous reader writes: Google launched a new keyboard application called "Gboard" for iOS today that features Google Search built-in to the keyboard itself.

- In addition, it offers swipe-based typing and access to GIFs, as well as some basic features like emojis and word predictions.

- From there you can search for things like flight times, news articles, restaurant and business listings, weather and more, and paste that information into your chat with a single tap.

- "We wanted to bring the best of Google to Gboard, so you'll see Maps, Translate, image and video search, News and others," says Rajan Patel, head of the product team that developed Gboard.

- "Initially, Gboard will not surface any information specific to you," he added, hinting that a personalized keyboard is in the works for the future.

## A Bored Hacker Easily Stole And Defaced More Than 70 Subreddits

- An anonymous reader writes: Hacker, BVM, said he's "lost count" of the number of subreddits he's stolen and defaced, but estimates that the number is more than 70.

- He claims Reddit's crummy security, and lack of two-factor authentication are what has made his exploits possible.

- It's not like it's really a challenge or anything so I just do it to pass time," the hacker told Motherboard in an online chat.

- However, he did admit he's been hacking into moderators' accounts and then changing the CSS style of the pages, replacing it with a note taking responsibility.

- Reddit appears to be responding to these incidents quickly, restoring the subreddits.

## Court Backs Snowden, Strikes Secret Laws

- It also analyzed the NSA order to Verizon, leaked by Snowden, that proved the existence of the program and revealed indirectly the legal reasoning that the government relied on to authorize the metadata collection.The Second Circuit seemed supremely untroubled by the origin of the information in a violation of classification laws.

- At one point, it noted that the government disputed the claim that virtually all metadata are being collected -- then dismissed the governments suggestion as unconvincing in the light of the evidence.

- The secrecy, in turn, implied that the statute meant to preclude anyone from challenging the program under the non-secret provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, the catch-all statute for challenging unlawful government programs.The Second Circuit wisely rejected what it called this argument from secrecy. It reversed a lower district court that had refused to allow the suit to proceed, and set the stage for an analysis of relevance under the statute.Relevance, the court said, should be measured the way the idea is used in ordinary grand jury investigations.

- Well, a prosecutor can also subpoena the recipe the cook used to make it.The government argued that this broad standard of relevance covered the metadata its been gathering.

- That left Congress and the President with the option of changing the law to authorize the metadata collection, assuming political will were to exist.This was the right result -- but not necessarily because of privacy, which the court didnt address directly at all.

## ZFS For Linux Finally Lands In Debian GNU/Linux Repos

-  

-  ZFS For Linux Finally Lands In Debian GNU/Linux Repos  (softpedia.com) 

- prisoninmate quotes a report from Softpedia: It took the Debian developers many years to finally be able to ship a working version of ZFS for Linux on Debian GNU/Linux.

- For those not in the known, ZFS on Linux is the official OpenZFS implementation for Linux, which promises to offer native ZFS filesystem support for any Linux kernel-based operating system, currently supporting Arch Linux, Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, openSUSE, and now Debian.

- And it looks like their ZFS for Linux implementation borrows a lot of patches from Ubuntu, at least according to the changelog for zfs-linux 0.6.5.6-2, the version that is now available in the unstable channel for Debian users to install and test.

## Criminals exploit zero day Flash vulnerability

- 

- Adobe will this week patch a critical vulnerability in Flash Player that is being actively exploited in the wild. Not information is available on the exploit (CVE-2016-4117) ahead of the patch that is set for release from tomorrow.  

- "A critical vulnerability (CVE-2016-4117) exists in Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.226 and earlier versions for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Chrome OS," Adobe says. "Adobe is aware of a report that an exploit for CVE-2016-4117 exists in the wild. "Successful exploitation could cause a crash and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.

- " It is possible that the exploit is being used in crime kits such as Angler, the developers of which are eager to find new ways to attack scores of users through runtimes like Flash, Java, and Silverlight. The exploit could be used in malvertising campaigns.

- If so it could mean anyone running some combination of updated Windows, Adobe Flash, and Internet Explorer could be silently compromised by merely visiting a website that is delivering malicious advertisements. Such an attack was deployed last month when criminals behind the Magnitude and Nuclear exploit kits were found exploiting the then zero day vulnerabilities. Adobe released an out-of-band patch in a bid to avoid mass casualties across the web.

## Compression tool 7-Zip pwned, pain flows to top security, software tools

- Some of the world's biggest security and software vendors will be rushing to patch holes in implementations of the popular 7-zip compression tool to stop attackers gaining full control of customer machines. Cisco security researcher Marcin Noga found and reported the holes to the maintainers of the open source 7-Zip platform who kindly cooked up a fix.  

- Colleague Jaeson Schultz told The Register the flaws could allow attackers to compromise updated machines, giving attackers the same access rights as logged-in users. "Anytime the vulnerable code is being run by any sort of privileged account, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability and execute code under those same permissions," Schultz says. "A fully patched Windows 10 box lacking the 7-Zip fixes would not help you.

- Google searches reveal hugely popular affected products including FireEye and MalwareBytes, however it is important to note the vulnerabilities are not due to flaws in these offerings. The researcher, from Cisco's Talos security team, reported the borked input validation flaws detailing where the bad code exists after 7-Zip had produced patched version 16. "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the way 7-Zip handles Universal Disk Format files ... [which] can be triggered by any entry that contains a malformed Long Allocation Descriptor," Schultz says. "An exploitable heap overflow vulnerability exists in the Archive::NHfs::CHandler::ExtractZlibFile method functionality of 7-Zip. "There is no check whether the size of the block is bigger than size of the buffer buf, which can result in a malformed block size which exceeds the mentioned buf size.

- This will cause a buffer overflow and subsequent heap corruption.

- " Schultz says many vulnerabilities stem from a failure to validate untrusted input data, a feat that is of critical importance application security.

## Linux 4.6: What's new and improved

- This isolates  the EFI code, which is used in secure boot mechanisms, from the rest of the kernel.  

- Other changes in "Charred Weasel," named for poor furry critter that was fried by accident in the Linux-powered Large Hadron Collider, include the following features.

- Technology vendors are using a gloomy backdrop to pitch omnichannel, analytics and the Internet of things as magic bullets vs. Amazon.

- Another enterprise server improvement is that in Linux 4.6 a long standing Infiniband interface problem has finally been fixed.

## We Should All Have Something to Hide

- As James Duane, a professor at Regent Law School and former defense attorney, notes in his excellent lecture on why it is never a good idea to talk to the police:

- As a majority of people in these states apparently favor these changes, advocates for the US democratic process cite these legal victories as examples of how the system can provide real freedoms to those who engage with it through lawful means.

- Even ignoring this obvious potential for new abuse, its also substantially closer to that dystopian reality of a world where law enforcement is 100% effective, eliminating the possibility to experience alternative ideas that might better suit us.

- Not a balance of forces which are looking for the perfect compromise between security and privacy, but an enormous steam roller built out of careers and billions in revenue from surveillance contracts and technology.

- Even if you believe that voting is more than a selection of meaningless choices designed to mask the true lack of agency we have, there is a tremendous amount of money and power and influence on the other side of this equation.

## Tor Browser 6.0 is released

-  The Tor Browser Team is proud to announce the first stable release in the 6.0 series.

- This should help our users who had trouble with getting Tor Browser to work on their Mac due to Gatekeeper interference.

- There were bundle layout changes necessary to adhere to code signing requirements but the transition to the new Tor Browser layout on disk should go smoothly. The release also features new privacy enhancements and disables features where we either did not have the time to write a proper fix or where we decided they are rather potentially harmful in a Tor Browser context. On the security side this release makes sure that SHA1 certificate support is disabled and our updater is not only relying on the signature alone but  is checking the hash of the downloaded update file as well before applying it.

- Moreover, we provide a fix for a Windows installer related DLL hijacking vulnerability. A note on our search engine situation: Lately, we got a couple of comments on our blog and via email wondering why we are now using DuckDuckGo as the default search engine and not Disconnect anymore.

- While Disconnect is still trying to fix the situation we asked them to change the fallback to DuckDuckGo as their search results are strictly better than the ones Bing delivers. Update: We plan to post instructions for removing the OS X code signing parts on our website soon.

## The day we discovered our parents were Russian spies

- They, along with eight other agents, had been betrayed by a Russian spy who had defected to the Americans. The FBI indictment detailing their misdeeds was a catalogue of espionage cliches: dead drops, brush-pasts, coded messages and plastic bags stuffed with crisp dollar bills.

- An uncle and a cousin the brothers had no idea existed paid a visit; a grandmother also dropped by, but she spoke no English and the boys not a word of Russian. It would be a few days before their parents would arrive, having admitted at a court hearing in New York on 8 July that they were Russian nationals.

- Donald studied for an MBA at the cole des Ponts and the family lived frugally in a small flat not far from the Eiffel Tower; both brothers shared the only bedroom while the parents slept on the sofa. As Bezrukov and Vavilova built up their story, the country that had recruited and trained them ceased to exist.

- Did they really never suspect a thing? In 2012, the Wall Street Journal reported that unnamed US officials claimed an FBI bug placed at the familys Boston home had picked up the parents revealing their true identities to Tim long before the arrest.

- Bezrukov was given a job at MGIMO, a prestigious Moscow university, and has written a book on the geopolitical challenges facing Russia. Tim and Alex were given Russian passports at the end of December 2010; suddenly, they became Timofei and Alexander Vavilov.

- I would give you bits of information about some interesting topics which you can further explore. The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language.

- This book is an outcome of my desire to have something like this when I was beginning to learn Python. If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there is something for you in this book. Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python.

- The topics are not explained in depth, instead only the minimum required information is given. I am sure you are as excited as I am so lets start! Note: This book is a continuous work in progress.

- If you find anything which you can further improve (I know you will find a lot of stuff) then kindly submit a pull request!   Author I am Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid.

## Security challenges for the Qubes build process

- The rationale for this has been to make it significantly more difficult to target the specific developer/machine building official Qubes packages/releases even if an adversary has somehow managed to get control of one of the signing keys for one of the components we've chosen to trust (e.g.

- Yet, this straightforward approach is complicated by the fact that some components, such as the Xen hypervisor would like to download additional sources on which their own build targets depend.

- Sadly, this is often done in a very insecure way, as demonstrated by Xen's build scripts, which are wget-ing additional sources from the Internet over plaintext connections, without checking the signatures (however absurd that might sound in 2016...).

- So, what are the chances that, due to this bug, the Xen Makefile managed to download a maliciously-modified source tarball and that we used it for building one of the official Qubes RPMs or ISOs?

- Such logs, in addition to displaying any such potential error messages, might also show hashes of all the input sources and packages, as well as those that were the outcome of the process (this in turn to make it more difficult for an adversary who has stolen Qubes signing key to perform targeted attacks on users).

## KNOX knocked three times by Israeli infosec boffins

- A pair of Israeli researchers has detailed their discovery of three Android / KNOX vulnerabilities in older Samsung phones, and it makes for depressing reading. In this paper at Arxiv, Tel Aviv University's Uri Kanonov and Avishai Wool dissect KNOX for your enjoyment.

- The ARM TrustZone, they write, does a good job of mitigating root and kernel exploits, but only if it's used right, and that requires proper usage of its features in all surrounding areas to gain the promised security boost. For The Register, one of the killer phrases in the paper is: we contrast KNOX 1.0 with the most recent version of KNOX: we show how the latest KNOX improves security while also making security sacrifices in favour of user satisfaction.

- Convenience, it seems, still trumps security. The paper describes the discovery of three vulnerabilities:  

- CVE-2016-1919, Weak eCryptFS Key generation from user password on KNOX 1.0 / Android 4.3;

- Serve forged SSL/TLS certificates while performing MITM.   The only social engineering required, the authors note, is to present a benign-looking Knox icon for the VPN and a similarly innocuous connection name, users will probably continue past the warning.

## Being privacy-aware in 2016

- Regardless of your thoughts on the subject, if you are just a concerned citizen or the newest whistle-blower, there are some ways you can protect your privacy while browsing the Internet or visiting a new country.

- Also, in USA (and UK and probably many other countries) a court might demand you decrypt the hard-drives or hold you in contempt and throw your sorry ass in the jail until you comply.

- All those plugins will probably need to be compiled (helps immensely if you have a Linux machine) and if you are a programmer, I recommend you to look over the source code on each update, so that you can spot any rogue functions.

- If you are really paranoid, mark the screws on your laptop with wax/nail polish, but once you go that way ... it's hard to come back. Use a BIOS password and disable boot from anything else than the local hard-disk/SSD, a BIOS password won't be hard to bypass (removing the battery from the mainboard) but it might prevent a thief from accessing your data since the laptop screws will need to be removed.

- Everybody knows all hosted git services are like a black hole that keeps drawing in (through our own mistakes) private keys from various projects, though we all deny ever doing that.Install OpenWRT or ddWRT on your home router (if it does support them), secure it using a SSH private key (if you have a SSH server running on it), keep it updated and close all incoming connections to your local network (or log them, whatever you see fit).Install a more privacy-oriented operating system: Windows (any version of it) is not really suited because it leaks so much information about the user, has telemetry software installed, is not free, you can't inspect the source code, there are specific domains that cannot be blocked in the firewall, etc.

## Securefs now has experimental Windows support

- securefs is a filesystem in userspace (FUSE) that transparently encrypts and authenticates data stored. It is particularly designed to secure data stored in the cloud.

- securefs mounts a regular directory onto a mount point. The mount point appears as a regular filesystem, where one can read/write/create files, directories and symbolic links.

## Progress in censorship circumvention: overview of Tor and Pluggable transports

- The second security problem is the ability for the agent to actively probe the Tor Relay Node to check if it responds to the initial obfs2 handshake, just like the Chinese Firewall has implemented at the moment.

- Obfs4 seems like an big incremental upgrade over obfs3 satisfying both the obfuscation of the traffic  (disallowing identification) and the ability to resist active probing mechanisms (by requiring the knowledge of the NODEID and Cruve25519 public key).

- This could be either due to the inability for an Agent to identify possible circumvention traffic or if the protocol resists an actual probing attempt (such as requiring the knowledge of a node ID).

- As you can see in the figure, it will be hard for an agent to determine if the TLS stream between the Meek client and the front domain is actually requesting www.google.com or if its sending POST data to a hosted appspot instance.

- A lot of these traffic obfuscation protocols are actually deployed and usable without the use of tor, for example VPN connections (obfsproxy) or P2P networks (such as Lantarn which also uses domain fronting [23]).

## Entanglement Made Simple

- This enables us to pry the subtlety of entanglement itself apart from the general oddity of quantum theory.  Quantized A monthly column in which top researchers explore the process of discovery.

- This months columnist, Frank Wilczek, is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Entanglement arises in situations where we have partial knowledge of the state of two systems.

- This is the heart of complementarity, as Niels Bohr formulated it. As a consequence, quantum theory forces us to be circumspect in assigning physical reality to individual properties.

- ) Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (EPR) described a startling effect that can arise when two quantum systems are entangled.

- This is a quantum temporal analogue of the simplest entanglement situations illustrated above. Katherine Taylor for Quanta MagazineFrank Wilczek Using a slightly more elaborate protocol we can add the wrinkle of complementarity to this system, and define situations that bring out the many worlds aspect of quantum theory.

## British Hacker Love Wins Court Battle Over Encryption Keys

- The NCA argued, in the ruling documents, that they could only ascertain the contents of the devices if Love was forced to provide the encryption key

- A judge in Westminster has ruled that alleged hacktivist Lauri Love cannot be forced to provide encryption keys to the National Crime Authority

- The NCA's request was widely regarded as an attempt to circumvent the Regulatory of Investigative Powers Act of 2000, which specifically legislates police power to compel subjects to hand over encryption keys.

## Save Firefox

-  Once upon a time, there were two major browsers that virtually everyone used: Netscape and Internet Explorer, locked in a death-battle for the future of the Web.

- Since 2013, the organization has provided a forum where today's dominant browser companies and the dominant entertainment companies can collaborate on a system to let our browsers control our behavior, rather than the other way. This system, "Encrypted Media Extensions" (EME) uses standards-defined code to funnel video into a proprietary container called a "Content Decryption Module."

- Worse still: the DMCA is also routinely used by companies to threaten and silence security researchers who reveal embarrassing defects in their products.

- The W3C also declined to require its members to protect security researchers who discover flaws in EME, leaving every Web user vulnerable to vulnerabilities whose disclosure can only safely take place if the affected company decides to permit it. The W3C needs credibility with people who care about the open Web and innovation in order to be viable.

- But the organization made a terrible decision when it opted to provide a home for EME, and an even worse one when it overruled its own members and declined protection for security research and new competitors. It needs to hear from you now.

## Had a coffee too late and still want to sleep well? Eat broccoli

- For example, a woman who was a heavy coffee drinker who was also taking clozapine (an anti-schizophrenic medication) was found to have about 2 12 times higher blood levels of the drug when she took caffeine.

- Caffeine may cause therapeutic failure in patients receiving lithium (an antipsychotic), may cause toxic reactions in patients receiving clozapine (another antipsychotic), may augment the efficacy of aspirin and acetainophen (Tylenol), and may have no significant consequences, despite metabolic interactions, on the effects of mexiletine (an antiarrhythmic).[vii]  For this reason, some scientists have suggested that the FDA should require that drugs interacting with caffeine be labeled with an advisory about these interactions.[viii] Finally, certain substances other than drugs can activate the production of CYP1A2 and thus increase its activity.

- For example, narigenin, the chemical that makes grapefruit juice bitter, by inhibiting the production of CYP1A2, slows the clearance of caffeine from the body and prolongs its half-life by over 30%![xii]

## Whitespace Steganography

- The program SNOW is used to conceal messages in ASCII text by appending whitespace to the end of lines

- Because spaces and tabs are generally not visible in text viewers, the message is effectively hidden from casual observers.
