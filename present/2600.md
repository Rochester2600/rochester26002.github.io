## Windows zero-day exploited by same group behind DNC hack

- On Oct. 31, Google's Threat Analysis Group revealed a vulnerability in most versions of Windows that is actively being exploited by malware attacks.

-  Today, Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices group, acknowledged the exploit was being used actively by a sophisticated threat groupthe same threat group involved in the hacks that led to the breach of data from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.

- And while a patch is on the way for the vulnerability, he encouraged customers to upgrade to Windows 10 for protection from further advanced threats. In an advisory, Myerson wrote: Recently, the activity group that Microsoft Threat Intelligence calls STRONTIUM conducted a low-volume spear-phishing campaign.

- "Along these lines, patches for all versions of Windows are now being tested by many industry participants, and we plan to release them publicly on the next Update Tuesday, Nov 8.

- "Google's decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk.

## New leak may show if you were hacked by the NSA

- Shadow Brokersthe name used by a person or group that created seismic waves in August when it published some of the National Security Agency's most elite hacking toolsis back with a new leak that the group says reveals hundreds of organizations targeted by the NSA over more than a decade. "TheShadowBrokers is having special trick or treat for Amerikanskis tonight," said the Monday morning post, which was signed by the same encryption key used in the August posts.

- " Monday's leak came as former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin III remains in federal custody on charges that he hoarded an astounding 50 terabytes of data in his suburban Maryland home.

- Vitali Kremez, a senior intelligence analyst at security firm Flashpoint, also provides useful analysis here. The dump also includes various other pieces of data.

- Linux and FreeBSD are also shown. "If this data is believed then it may contain a list of computers which were targeted during this time period," the analysis provided by Hacker House, a firm that offers various security services, stated.

- Typically, redirectors are used to surreptitiously direct someone from one domain to another. Other purported NSA tools discussed in Monday's dump have names including DEWDROP, INCISION, JACKLADDER, ORANGUTAN, PATCHICILLIN, RETICULUM, SIDETRACK, AND STOCSURGEON.

## How to block the ultrasonic signals you didnt know were tracking you

- And though you probably have no idea that dog whistle marketing is going on, researchers are already offering ways to protect yourself. The technology, called ultrasonic cross-device tracking, embeds high-frequency tones that are inaudible to humans in advertisements, web pages, and even physical locations like retail stores.

- These ultrasound beacons emit their audio sequences with speakers, and almost any device microphonelike those accessed by an app on a smartphone or tabletcan detect the signal and start to put together a picture of what ads youve seen, what sites youve perused, and even where youve been.

- Now that youre sufficiently concerned, the good news is that at the Black Hat Europe security conference on Thursday, a group based at University of California, Santa Barbara will present an Android patch and a Chrome extension that give consumers more control over the transmission and receipt of ultrasonic pitches on their devices. Beyond the abstract creep factor of ultrasonic tracking, the larger worry about the technology is that it requires giving an app the ability to listen to everything around you, says Vasilios Mavroudis, a privacy and security researcher at University College London who worked on the research being presented at Black Hat.

- The researchers plan to post their patch and their extension available for download after their Black Hat presentation. Ultrasonic tracking has been evolving for the last couple of years, and it is relatively easy to deploy since it relies on basic speakers and microphones instead of specialized equipment.

- But the beacons need to complete their transmissions in the time it takes someone to briefly check a website or pass a store, and its difficult to fit an authentication process into those few seconds.

## Microsoft Doubles Down on Ethereum With New Blockchain Product - CoinDesk

- The product has been designed so that groups of companies can deploy a private ethereum network with a single click. Released privately to Github earlier this month, the streamlined set-up process and new features are part of a larger push by Microsoft toward blockchain that has to date focused mostly on its Azure cloud product as well as the enterprise business market. Microsoft Azures principal blockchain architect, Marley Gray, told CoinDesk: Were focused on building a sandbox for developers, working with customers and partners to develop and test combinations of technologies, and ultimately, helping collections of customers select the right tools that solve specific business problems. In addition to the one-click deployment, the update includes five new tools the projects manager said are specifically designed to let consortia networks develop more complex smart contracts for any number of self-executing business applications. Microsoft senior program manager Christine Avanessians highlighted one change that lets groups spin up consortia with as few as three nodes run from a single IP address. While the service still enables geographically dispersed nodes via the cloud integration, the changes could make it easier for companies to test the efficiencies potentially created from an alternative set up. Perhaps most importantly though, based on customer feedback on an earlier version, Avanessians said the Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network automatically creates user private keys to satisfy security requirements. Avanessians told CoinDesk: You no longer need to generate and provide a private key.

- The key is automatically generated from your provided passphrase, further simplifying the prerequisites. On the market for markets This new incarnation of Microsofts Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network is just the latest development in what is shaping up to be a competitive blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) industry. Microsofts biggest direct competitor for cloud-based BaaS services so far is IBM, which launched its own competing service in July.

- But startups are trying their hand at winning enterprise business as well. Deloitte spin-off Nuco, for example,entered the market earlier this year specifically to offer services for building blockchain consortia. In May, Microsoft Azures chief technical officer told CoinDesk the companys overall goal for its own version of the service is to help global industries build blockchain consortia. So far, most blockchain consortia have come from the financial sector, but Microsoft believes future industries will follow suit. Already, blockchain consortia are springing up around the world, with efforts in China, Japan and Russia all announced in the last few months. Dollar bills While financial numbers on the burgeoning industry are tough to come by, one indicator of the revenue at stake can be found in Microsofts BaaS sandbox, which boasts products from a wide range of blockchain startups. Monthly fees on the platform start with a base amount per virtual machine as low as about $14 and as high as about $90.

- The price increases based on the number of IP addresses ($2.98 per month) and the number of transactions conducted ($0.0036 per unit). Support options range from a free introductory offer up to $1,000 per month for professional grade support. Initially, the improved Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Networkis available as part of a free trial to anyone.

## Nude pics as IOU: a new, risky online loan among Chinese university students

-   Many Chinese university students were found to have used their nude pictures as IOUs on some online lending platforms, putting themselves at the risks of having everybody  including their parents  see them naked.  Such risky methods of IOU is found usable on several online lending platforms, but it is usually more often accepted within the QQ group chats connected to such platforms.

- Borrowers are also required to upload pictures of their ID cards and report their family information, including their address and cell phone numbers.  Once a clear photo of a naked borrower holding his or her ID card is uploaded to lenders, he or she can get up to 15,000 yuan ($2,277) credit with a maximum of 36 month installments, the Nandu Daily reported.  The credit varies based on the borrowers education background.

- Usually an undergraduate student can receive 15,000 yuan in credit, while those studying at famous universities as well as doctorate students can receive even larger loans.  What comes with the seemingly easy business transaction is costly overdue repayment.  According to a self-claimed former borrower Li Li (pseudonym), the weekly interest rate was 30 percent for her 500 yuan borrowed from an online platform in February.  As she kept failing to pay back on set payment due dates, she borrowed more money from the platform with the same weekly interest rate until the overdue payment grew to 55,000 yuan, which then led to a threat with her naked pictures, the Nandu Daily reported.  Li told the newspaper that many of her fellow students have borrowed money in this way, but most were too ashamed to talk.  Snapshots of similar threatening collection messages have also gone viral, with a photo of a female borrower and a message reading how the lender would send the photo and her naked video footage to her family members if she could not pay back her 10,000 yuan borrowed on an annual interest rate of 24 percent within a week.  Naked IOUs started long ago.

- Not only university students but many others also borrowed money with nude pictures, an insider surnamed Zhang told Nandu Daily.  Another Chengdu-based insider said naked pictures are often acceptable as IOUs in underground private loans companies and borrowers  who are usually loaded with debt  are ineligible at standard companies, but they can get tens of thousands from such underground sources.  By Monday evening, several online lending platforms that secretly offer naked IOUs have issued notices on their QQ group chats to stop receiving nude pictures as IOU, Nandu Daily reported.

## Microsoft Joins the Linux Foundation

- Microsoft today said it is joining the Linux Foundation as a high-paying Platinum member.

- Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin said, "This may come as a surprise to you, but they were not big fans," describing the two's previous relationship.

- From a report on TechCrunch: The new Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella, however, is singing a very different tune.

- Over the course of just the last few years, it has essentially built Canonical's Ubuntu distribution into Windows 10, brought SQL Server to Linux, open-sourced core parts of its .NET platform and partnered with Red Hat, SUSE and others.

- As Zemlin noted, Microsoft has also contributed to a number of Linux Foundation-managed projects like Node.js, OpenDaylight, the Open Container Initiative, the R Consortium and the Open API Initiative.ArsTechnica has more details.

## Windows 10 Informs Chrome and Firefox Users That Edge is 'Safer'

-  Windows 10 Informs Chrome and Firefox Users That Edge is 'Safer'  (venturebeat.com) 

- An anonymous reader shares a VentureBeat report:Microsoft has turned on a new set of Windows Tips that inform Chrome and Firefox users on Windows 10 that Edge is a "safer" browser.

- We reached out to Microsoft to find out how long this latest recommendation has been active.

- "This wave of Windows Tips for Windows 10 users began in early November," a Microsoft spokesperson told VentureBeat.

- If this sounds familiar, that's because Microsoft turned on similar Windows 10 tips back in July, warning Chrome/Firefox users about battery drain and then recommending Edge instead.

## iPhones send call history to Apple, security firm says

- The company has gone to great lengths to secure customer data in recent years, by implementing better encryption for all phones and refusing to undermine that encryption. But private information still escapes from Apple products under some circumstances.

- The latest involves the companys online syncing service iCloud. Russian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft has found that Apples mobile devices automatically send a users call history to the companys servers if iCloud is enabled  but the data gets uploaded in many instances without user choice or notification. You only need to have iCloud itself enabled for the data to be sent, said Vladimir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft. The logs surreptitiously uploaded to Apple contain a list of all calls made and received on an iOS device, complete with phone numbers, dates and times, and duration.

- The iPhone menu corresponding to the service gives users the option of syncing mail, contacts, calendars, reminders, browser history, and notes and wallet data.

- Nonetheless, he says, They should allow people to disable that if they want to. Even as Apple has increased the security of its mobile devices in recent years, the company has been moving more and more data to the cloud, where it is less protected.

- I wont use it myself until I can be in control of the encryption keys, he said. Correction: Nov. 17, 2016 An earlier version of this story quoted the director of a university computer forensics program, who is also a former FBI supervisory agent, stating that telecom providers generally only retain call logs for 30 or 60 days.

## Fake HP Printer That's Actually a Cellular Eavesdropping Device

- Fake HP Printer That's Actually a Cellular Eavesdropping Device

- Julian Oliver has designed and built a cellular eavesdropping device that's disguised as an old HP printer.

- Masquerading as a regular cellular service provider, Stealth Cell Tower surreptitiously catches phones and sends them SMSs written to appear they are from someone that knows the recipient.

- With each response to these messages, a transcript is printed revealing the captured message sent, alongside the victim's unique IMSI number and other identifying information.

- Every now and again the printer also randomly calls phones in the environment and on answering, Stevie Wonder's 1984 classic hit I Just Called To Say I Love You is heard.

## NSA Chief: Nation-State Made 'Conscious Effort' To Sway US Presidential Election

- The head of the US National Security Agency has said that a "nation-state" consciously targeted presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, in order to affect the US election.

- Michael Rogers, who leads both the NSA and US Cyber Command, made the comments in response to a question about Wikileaks' release of nearly 20,000 internal DNC emails during a conference presented by The Wall Street Journal.

- This was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect."

- Rogers did not specify the nation-state or the specific effect, though US intelligence officials suspect Russia provided the emails to Wikileaks, after hackers stole them from inside DNC servers and the personal email account of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta.

- At least two different hacker groups associated with the Russian government were found inside the networks of the DNC over the past year, reading emails, chats, and downloading private documents.

## Qualcomm now offering US$15k for security bugs

- 

- Qualcomm's been bitten by the bounty bug, signing on with HackerOne to offer up to US$15,000 for vulnerabilities in modems and processors. The bounty covers Snapdragon 400, 615, 801, 805 808, 810, 820 and 821 processors, and its X5, X7, X12 and X16 LTE modems.  

-  

- A vulnerability in any one of these would reach a long way into the wild.

- The Snapdragon X20, to pick one example, is in current-generation smartphones from Google, Samsung, Motorola, LG, ZTE, Sony, Asus, HTC, and HP. Because the company has about 65 per cent of the LTE market, the Quadrooter bug that landed during Def Con in August was thought to affect up to 900 million devices. Qualcomm's note at HackerOne gives white hats a pretty wide brief: Linux kernel code 3.14 or newer in the Android for MSM project, written by the Qualcomm Innovation Center and not in an end-of-life branch. There are also rewards for bootloader bugs, anything that has root or system, privileges, the modem, networking firmware (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth), or the Qualcomm Secure Execution on Trustzone. Merely crashing a process isn't enough; the bug has to then let the attacker get to code execution.

## Tell HN: Riseup.net fails to update canary; fingerprints deleted without notice

- To survive and act against dictatorships or invading armies is not easy, they had to be smart.But still, because travelling is expensive and networking today is a need for some of those groups or collectives, they can communicate with each other talking about their resolutions or activities, which are not secret (as I already said, its assumed there can be a IRL infiltrate) but they are also not public.You can see SMTP and mailing lists as a huge security risk, and they are, its just not very common to see people that assume the opposite around here.  smonff 2 days ago  Also, sometimes, some activists can deliberately use a mailing list as a public expression channel because it is important that these things can be eared by everybody.I see it as sticking posters in the street.

- It gives the illusion of security like how TSA baggage check is a big dance of scanning, pat-downs, and key ceremonies.For context, consider Yahoo Mail, where emails are read by intelligence agencies before the user even gets them.

- I have to remember this quote:If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hangedWhat I mean is that I can decide to not encrypt and have my emails under public scrutiny, but as I said, most people are not scared enough because it doesnt happen on their watch.It doesnt matter what the content is, or how non-libelous - if its encrypted with PGP, its private.  smonff 2 days ago  I would add that Riseup dont claim to be the best on security or privacy. Riseup provides online communication tools for people and groups working on liberatory social change.

- - so the fact he hasnt is worthy of our suspicion.EDIT - I really did mean didnt want to start full discussion, because there apparently is a whole lot more circumstantial evidence, including regarding some of the people you mentioned (like some members of his legal team being barred entry), but seriously, Im going to leave the fullness of that discussion for Reddit, and think anyone who is interested in it should take it up there.  notahacker 11 days ago  To be honest, people that arent going to be convinced that an in-depth video interview John Pilger asserts was made on October 30th or an abundance of statements from all parties about two days worth of formal interviews over the court case thats dogged him for a while arent going to be convinced by a quick video of him saying I atent dead yet, or probably even a keysigned message.There are an abundance of pretty straightforward hypotheses consistent with the known facts(e.g. Assange isnt feeling fine because hes still angry and/or paranoid about his preferred internet connection being taken away, Assange feels this story is good publicity, relative to other kinds of publicity hes getting at the moment) but of course these arent the ones being discussed on Where is Assange? subreddits.  orthoganol 11 days ago  Sorry, but cmon, that entire subreddit would disappear overnight if Julian gave just one, basic proof of well being.

- The majority of the 12,000 (and fast growing) are not conspiracy people, they just have a very simple request for a PGP message, a picture, a video, a public appearance, anything.Again, I encourage the debate of circumstantial evidence on Reddit instead of here, but Julian does not say anything to indicate recency (pre mid October) in the Pilger interview, otherwise that would have probably ended the subreddit.

## Homeopathy 'treatments' must be labelled to say they do not work, US gov orders

- Now, the US government is requiring that producers of such items ensure that if they want to claim they are effective treatments, then they need to make available the proof.

- Homeopathy, which dates back to the late-eighteenth century, is based on the view that disease symptoms can be treated by minute doses of substances that produce similar symptoms when provided in larger doses to healthy people, said a notice, filed earlier this month by the Federal Trade Commission.

- Slate said there was near-unanimous mainstream scientific consensus that homeopathys purported mechanism of action - using ultra-highly diluted substances to allow like to cure like - runs counter to basic principles of chemistry, biology, and physics.

-   Health policy expert Timothy Caulfield recently said: To believe homeopathy works ... is to believe in magic. 

- The FTC said that a homeopathic drug claim that is not substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence might not be deceptive if the advertisement or label where it appears effectively communicates that: 1) there is no scientific evidence that the product works; and 2) the products claims are based only on theories of homeopathy from the 1700s that are not accepted by most modern medical experts.

## Google Joins Microsoft's .NET Foundation

- Emil Protalinski, writing for VentureBeat:As part of its slew of announcements at its Connect(); 2016 developer event in New York City today, Microsoft unveiled that Google is joining the .NET Foundation.

- Specifically, Google is becoming a member of the Technical Steering Group, which Microsoft says "reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community" and also underlines "Google's commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET."

- In short, Google will help steer the future of .NET in a way that is "similar to an open standard," Xamarin cofounder and Microsoft's current vice president of mobile developer tools, Nat Friedman, told VentureBeat.

- Google's decision is being driven by its enterprise business (Google Cloud) and the desire to keep up with businesses adopting public and hybrid clouds.

- The company sees the move as part of its commitment to open-source technology, which benefits all enterprises, and cross-platform development that gives developers and IT professionals access to the best tools.

## Google Cloud Will Add GPU Services in Early 2017

- Google Cloud will add GPUs as a service early next year, the company has said.

- From a report on GeekWire: Google may be seeking to distinguish itself, however, with the variety of GPUs it's offering.

- And Google will charge by the minute, not by the hour, making GPU usage more affordable for customers needing it only for short periods.

- CPU-based machines in the cloud are good for general-purpose computing, but certain tasks such as rendering or large-scale simulations are much faster on specialized processors, Google explained.

- GPUs contain hundreds of times as many computational cores as CPUs and excel at performing risk analysis, studying molecular binding or optimizing the shape of a turbine blade.

## Microsoft Announces Visual Studio For Mac

- From a Venture Beat report:"We want to help developers achieve more and capitalize on the industry's shift toward cloud-first and mobile-first experiences using the tools and platforms of their choice," Microsoft Cloud and enterprise executive vice president Scott Guthrie said in a statement.

- "By collaborating with the community to provide open, flexible, and intelligent tools and cloud services, we're helping every developer deliver unprecedented levels of innovation."

- The fact that Microsoft is bringing its IDE to macOS would have arguably been the biggest news of the day, had the company not leaked the information itself earlier this week.

- Still, a preview of Visual Studio for Mac is now available, letting developers write cloud, mobile, and macOS apps on Apple's desktop operating system using .NET and C#.

- This has changed over time, with a big highlight in April 2015 when Microsoft launched Visual Studio Code, its cross-platform code editor, for Windows, Mac, and Linux.More info on Microsoft releasing SQL Server Preview for Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## Google Bans Hundreds Of Pixel Phone Resellers From Their Google Accounts

-  Google Bans Hundreds Of Pixel Phone Resellers From Their Google Accounts  (theguardian.com) 

- Hundreds of Google users lost their access to their emails, photos, documents, "and anything else linked to their Google identity," wrote the Guardian last week, reporting on "hundreds of people who took advantage of a loophole in US sales tax to make a small profit on Pixel phones" -- and got all of the Google accounts suspended.

- Long-time Slashdot reader RockDoctor writes:  "The Google customers had all bought the phones from the company's Project Fi mobile carrier, and had them shipped directly to a reseller in New Hampshire, a US state with no sales tax.

- In return, the reseller split the profit with the customers," the Guardian adds.

- To which the obvious answer is "because we can, and you agreed to these (link to 3000 pages of text) terms and conditions, including our ability to do this"...

## OTF Summit: Countering Censorship Through Collaboration

- All of these groups play a part in creating a more open and accessible internet. In this context, the annual OTF Summit serves as a breeding ground for collaboration, discussion, problem-solving, learning, listening, and, ultimately, partnership formation.

- The Summit fosters the development of new ideas and approaches born out of this unique atmosphere where cross-pollination is achieved through open sessions and an unconference structure that facilitates creativity, allowing new connections to flourish unimpeded. These newfound relationships and gained perspectives yield meaningful outcomes that would simply not be possible if not for the increasingly rare opportunity to connect in-person on a more human level, something that can be challenging given the digitally-driven nature of this communitys work. The 2016 Summit, hosted in Baltimore, MD, from October 18-20, was especially notable for its thematic emphasis on diversity, gender, and inclusion (special thanks to our friends at the Media Democracy Fund (MDF) for making this possible).

- These are issues that especially impact the technology sector and have in the past had negative ramifications on the productivity, mental health, well-being, and retention of people working in the Internet Freedom space.

- By framing our discussions in a way that allows for the consideration and inclusion of all members of society, we hope to together take a pragmatic step forward that ultimately improves the Internet Freedom community and all its unique members. As adversaries of a free and open internet worldwide pour more and more resources into improving their censorship capabilities and new threats emerge, the Internet Freedom community has remained resilient in continuing to develop novel approaches that allow users in repressive environments to exercise their universal rights to free speech and human rights online.

- The challenges are manifold and the stakes great, but by recognizing and pursuing the benefits of diversity and collaboration, we believe a more free and open internet can be achieved. As we move forward to a new year, we at OTF would like to express our most sincere gratitude to all Summit 2016 participants.

## Shhh! Shazam is always listening  even when it's been switched 'off'

- A security researcher has discovered that when the Mac version of Shazam is switched off, it simply stops processing recorded data.

- " Shazam confirmed Wardle's findings that its Mac app is continually recording even when "off" but told The Register that this behaviour was benign. For the Mac, the mic is left on for technical reasons explained below but no audio is processed, so the user's decision not to leverage our app's functionality is fully respected.

- " Shazam's techies promised Wardle that a forthcoming update would change the problematic behaviour, an assurance not contained in its statement to El Reg, which generally downplays the situation.

- IMHO this is not ideal as the app is still recoding  it's nice of them to stop processing that data, but yah, they are still recording all the time.

-  Bootnote 1Separate recent research by Wardle showed how advanced Mac malware might be able piggy-back on to legitimate webcam sessions in order to surreptitiously record the local user.

## Microsoft plans St Valentine's Day massacre for SHA1

- The death knell for the SHA1 cryptographic hash function will echo around the web now that all the main browser builders have decided to cut off support  only 12 years after its flaws were first discovered. On Friday, Mozilla and Microsoft both announced that support for SHA1 in HTTPS certificates would be dropped  Moz with build 51 of Firefox in January and Microsoft on February 14 for its Edge and Internet Explorer 11 browsers.

- The delays have been driving some of the tech community up the wall, given that SHA1 was proven to be deeply flawed back in 2005 and has been getting progressively more insecure since then. The hash algorithm was published in 1993 as SHA0 by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

- In 2005, Xiaoyun Wang and Hongbo Yu from Shandong University and Yiqun Lisa Yin from Princeton University published a paper showing it was possible to find collisions (two messages that hash to the same hash value) in 269 operations, and possibly as low as 233  not the 280 operations first envisaged. This was worrying, but not necessarily fatal  it would still take an enormous amount of computing power to defeat, although nowhere near as much as first thought.

- It became clear that decryption times would drop. The number of operations needed to cause a collision continued to decrease and remained largely theoretical.

- Nevertheless, NIST recommended that government users upgrade to SHA2 (the hash published ten years earlier) as early as 2012, but there were plenty of hold-outs, even in the US military. In 2015, a paper (dubbed The ShAppening) published by Marc Stevens of the Dutch research institute Centrum Wiskunde, with Pierre Karpman and Thomas Peyrin from Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, showed you could break SHA1 with just $75,000 of compute power. This finally got the industry to remove its collective digit and start setting some decent security standards.

## Apple Keeps Constant Log of iPhone Calls in iCloud, Warns Cop Contractor

- That's the warning today from a Russian provider of iPhone hacking tools, Elcomsoft, which claimed the feature was automatic and there was no way to turn it off bar shutting down iCloud Drive altogether. Whilst it was well-known that iCloud backups would store call logs, contacts and plenty of other valuable data, users should be concerned to learn that their communications records are consistently being sent to Apple servers without explicit permission, said Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov.

- Last month, it revealed Apple had failed to properly secure its iTunes backups, making it much easier for its tools (and cybercriminals) to access users' information.

- Apple subsequently updated iOS 10 to improve backup security. Boon for cops Katalov believes automated iCloud storage of up-to-date logs would be beneficial for law enforcement wanting to get access to valuable iPhone data.

- In its data access guide for law enforcement, Apple says the iCloud information that's available includes email logs and content, text messages, photos, documents, contacts, calendars, bookmarks and iOS device backups. "iCloud only stores content for the services that the subscriber has elected to maintain in the account while the subscribers account remains active," Apple's document reads.

- I suspect whatever software engineer wrote that part of it probably decided to just go and stick that data in your iCloud Drive because thats kind of what its purpose is," said Zdziarski, who'd been briefed by Elcomsoft prior to today too.

## Meet PoisonTap, the $5 tool that ransacks password-protected computers

- The hack also installs a backdoor that makes the owner's Web browser and local network remotely controllable by the attacker. EnlargeSamy Kamkar PoisonTap is the latest creation of Samy Kamkar, the engineer behind a long line of low-cost hacks, including a password-pilfering keylogger disguised as a USB charger, a key-sized dongle that jimmies open electronically locked cars and garages, and a DIY stalker app that mined Google Streetview.

- While inspiring for their creativity and elegance, Kamkar's inventions also underscore the security and privacy tradeoffs that arise from an increasingly computerized world.

- Here's how it works. Once the PoisonTap software is installed, the Raspberry Pi device becomes a miniature Linux computer that presents itself as an Ethernet network.

- Like a router, it's responsible for allocating IP addresses for the local network through the dynamic host configuration protocol.

- But given the large number of unpatched authentication bypass vulnerabilities or default credentials that are never changed, such protections often don't pose much of an obstacle. PoisonTap challenges a tradition that can be found in almost any home or officethe age-old practice of briefly leaving a locked computer unattended.

## Remote work: 6 months later

- Yet, writing implies to think and to carefully choose our words before actually hitting the submit button; Meetings?

- We recently started training and consulting services, for which meeting in person is both mandatory and a plus.

- For example, we think that our habit to over-communicate via Slack, GitHub and iDoneThis has been very beneficial to date.

- To the contrary, and after several months, it became part of our daily routine to briefly catch what has been done in iDoneThis or #activity (our special Slack room for most of the notifications) in the morning, and to leave feedback, comments as well as dones (iDoneThis entries) before leaving the office.

- Talking about offices, we still have our Head Quarters in France, which now looks like a small co-working space.

## Baidus self-driving cars begin public test in Wuzhen, China

-  Internet giant Baidu is fast-forwarding its own self-driving car tests with a new public trial of autonomous vehicles, including cars supplied by Chinese automakers BYD, Chery and BAIC.

- The public tests opened for passengers on Tuesday, and have ferried around 200 people, as of today, across a 3.16 km (around 2 miles) stretch of road in tourist destination Wuzhen, which has been mapped with centimetre accuracy, according to Baidu. The driverless vehicles are equipped with Velodyne LiDAR, video cameras, millimeter wave radar and a computer brain to make sense of all that data developed by Baidu in-house and installed in the trunk.

- The cars switch lanes, negotiate intersections, pass slower cars and even make U-turns, achieving a max top speed of 60 km per hour (37 mph) in accordance with the local speed limit. There is a driver present in case of a need to take over control, but they dont have their hands on the wheel throughout the trip unless necessary, according to Baidu.

- A display within the car shows passengers info, including traffic conditions and objects along the path. Baidus targeting 2018 for the first production commercial vehicles on the road using this tech in a non-test capacity, with a broader rollout, including mass production, targeted for 2021.

- The company has made good progress on that road to date, given that it only began its autonomous driving business unit in earnest back in December 2015, though it had clearly been working on the project for some time since it also announced a successful test of automated driving tech in Beijing at that time. Baidu also recently began testing its vehicles in California, after receiving a permit for autonomous testing from the state DMV earlier this year.

## Fake Fingerprint Stickers Let You Access a Protected Phone While Wearing Gloves

- The sticker is powered by Nanotips and is "made with an extremely adhesive conductive material that can be applied to any surface for touch capability."

- Gizmodo reports:  You can of course still access a fingerprint-secured smartphone using regular touchscreen-friendly gloves by simply punching in your passcode on-screen, but why should we have to give up the convenience of a feature like Touch ID for months on end just because it's cold outside?

- We shouldn't, and these Taps stickers will allow you to use your mobile device's touchscreen and fingerprint reader, for unlocking your phone or making a purchase, even while your actual fingers (and fingerprints) are being kept warm and toasty inside a glove.

- After applying a textured stick to the tip of your glove, you just have to register it as an approved fingerprint using your smartphone's security settings.

- But according to its creators, using nanoparticle technology every single Taps sticker has an individual and unique artificial print ensuring that only your gloves can access your device.

## The Swiss Government is Paving the Way for Crypto Banks

-  Swiss Parliament member Franz Gruter could hardly be happier that his proposal for new blockchain regulations has been shot down. For months, he resisted the government's requests to kill his motion, which would have changed the definition of a bank to make it easier for cryptocurrency companies to open in Switzerland. "We got this," was the gist of what they told him.

- According to Swiss law, FINMA then had the right to recommend that such motions be passed, shot down or the ability to make a counter-proposal. In this case, Gruter says he was unwilling to rescind or "liquide" his own motion until he was contacted by a surprising source  the person who set him on on his cryptocurrency crusade, Wences Casares. "Wences approached me and he told me, 'Hey Franz, you won't believe it, they are totally excited, they want to introduce now a new group of crypto-banks that has totally different regulations,'" Gruter said, adding: "I decided there is no need at this point that I push it further since my intervention already worked and the government is making the changes proactively by themselves.

- " The future of 'crypto-banks' Now that Gruter has rescinded his initial proposal, he says hes only getting sporadic information about the future of these new financial entities. But thanks to a series of public documents, the crypto-banks makeup is beginning to take shape. Just days after Swiss rail operator SBB announced it would begin offering bitcoin via its ticket kiosks, Switzerland's Federal Department of Finance (FDF) published the first details about the project. Revealed earlier this month, these so-called "FinTech licenses" may be granted by FINMA with capital requirement as low as CHF 300,000, or 5% of the accepted public funds.

- (The total amount of public funds that can be accepted by those with a FinTech license may not exceed CHF 100m). The day before the FDF published the license details, FINMA released a corresponding document that helped lay the framework by redefining corporate governance guidelines for banks. Specifically, the document instituted the proportional application of certain regulations, "leaving institutions free to implement the requirements in a way that takes account of their differing business models and of the particular risks associated with them.

- " The mind shift Though an exact timeline has yet to be published, Switzerlands Federal Council has instructed the FDF to complete a draft of its legislative amendments by the beginning of next year. Some of the proposed measures could even be enacted by an executive order at an earlier date, according to Bitcoin Association Swtizerland founder, Luzius Meissner. As part of that work, the FDF is expected to join forces with related authorities to clarify certain stipulations and further reduce barriers for FinTech startups. According to Gruter, behind all these changes is nothing less than a total shift in the way Switzerland views cryptocurrency startups. Instead of being focused on the potential risks, Gruter argues that his colleagues have determined to prioritize the potential benefits. "The mindset is completely changing now from a certain critical, not really knowing what are the threats of the technology to a very open-minded, opportunity-driven people," said Gruter. Meisser reiterated Gruters position, but more cautiously. "It is great to see that the government finally starts to think about realizing opportunities instead of eliminating risks.

## Antivirus tools are a useless box-ticking exercise says Google security chap

- Kiwicon Google senior security engineer Darren Bilby has asked fellow hackers to expend less effort on tools like antivirus and intrusion detection to instead research more meaningful defences such as whitelisting applications. The incident responder from Google's Sydney office, who is charged with researching very advanced attacks including the 2009 Operation Aurora campaign, decried many existing tools as ineffective "magic" that engineers are forced to install for the sake of compliance but at the expense of real security.  

- "Please no more magic," he told the Kiwicon hacking conference in Wellington, New Zealand today. "We need to stop investing in those things we have shown do not work.

- " Bilby wants security types to focus on tools such as whitelisting, hardware security keys and dynamic access rights efforts like Google's Beyond Corp internal project. "Antivirus does some useful things, but in reality it is more like a canary in the coal mine.

- It's like we are standing around the dead canary saying 'Thank god it inhaled all the poisonous gas'," he said. The Google hacker also argued that networks are not a security defence because users are so easily able to use mobile networks to upload data to cloud services, bypassing all traditional defences. Advice on safe internet use is "horrible", he added.

- Telling users not to click on phishing links and to download strange executables effectively shifts blame to them and away from those who manufactured hardware and software that is not secure enough to be used online.

## Britain Has Passed the 'Most Extreme Surveillance Law Ever Passed in a Democracy'

- Zack Whittaker, reporting for ZDNet: The UK has just passed a massive expansion in surveillance powers, which critics have called "terrifying" and "dangerous.

- Four years and a general election later -- May is now prime minister -- the bill was finalized and passed on Wednesday by both parliamentary houses.

- Civil liberties groups have long criticized the bill, with some arguing that the law will let the UK government "document everything we do online.

- The law will force internet providers to record every internet customer's top-level web history in real-time for up to a year, which can be accessed by numerous government departments; force companies to decrypt data on demand -- though the government has never been that clear on exactly how it forces foreign firms to do that that; and even disclose any new security features in products before they launch.

- In other words, it's the "most extreme surveillance law ever passed in a democracy," according to Jim Killock, director of the Open Rights Group.

## OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set Version 3.0 Released

- Need a new set of generic attack detection rules for your web application firewall?

- Try the new OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set version 3.0.0!

- The rule set is most often deployed in conjunction with an existing Web Application Firewall like ModSecurity.

- Four years in the making, this release comes with dozens of new features including reduced false positives (by over 90% in the default setup), improved detection of SQLi, XSS, RCE and PHP injections, the introduction of a Paranoia Mode which allows assigning a certain security level to a site, and better documentation that takes the pain out of ModSecurity.

- There's rumors this new rule set is even being made into a movie

## 300 million Adultfriendfinder accounts breached

-  Adultfriendfinder, "the world's largest sex  swinger community," has suffered a major breach, leaking 300,000,000 accounts' worth of personal information, namely email addresses, passwords, usernames, IP addresses and browser information.

- According to ZDNet, which obtained a portion of the database and confirmed its legitimacy, the leaked information "does not appear to contain sexual preference data, unlike the 2015 breach."

-  Last week, the San Francisco Municipal Light Rail system (the Muni) had to stop charging passengers to ride because a ransomware hacker had taken over its network and encrypted the drives of all of its servers. READ THE REST

## Russian banks floored by withering DDoS attacks

- At least five Russian banks weathered days-long DDoS attacks this week. A wave of assaults began on Tuesday afternoon and continued over the next two days.

- Early indications are that the Mirai IoT botnet which disrupted DNS services for scores of high-profile websites in October 2016 may be behind the latest attacks but this is unconfirmed. The last DOOS attack on this scale against Russian banks was in October 2015, when eight major institutions were targeted. David Kennerley, director of threat research at Webroot, commented: "These latest DDoS attacks are extremely similar to the recent ones targeted at Dyn last month, and really drives home the security issues of the Internet of Things.

- If the default password had been changed, many of the webcams and CCTV devices that formed the botnet army would not have been successfully hijacked.

- " Paul McEvatt, senior cyber threat intelligence manager for Fujitsu in UK and Ireland, added: "The issue is that IoT device manufacturers are failing to implement robust security controls from the outset, whether that's for routers, smart devices or connected cars.

- Anyone can use online services such as Shodan to look for vulnerable IoT devices, making organisations an easy target for low-level cyber-criminals.

## FBI operated 23 Tor-hidden child porn sites, deployed malware from them

- As Ars has reported, federal investigators temporarily seized a Tor-hidden site known as Playpen in 2015 and operated it for 13 days before shutting it down.

- It's clever phrasing on their part. Security researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis told Ars that its a pretty reasonable assumption that at one point the FBI was running roughly half of the known child porn sites hosted on Tor-hidden servers.

- ) Rule 41's arrival In the Playpen case, the NITs deployment was signed off by one magistrate judge in Virginia, and it was used to target child porn users both in the United States and abroad.

- I would refer you to public documents on the Playpen investigation, in which we seized and operated a darkweb child pornography site for a period of less than two weeks, he e-mailed.

- So to suggest this is a common thing is patently not true. Lewis is herself a former computer scientist at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ, the British-equivalent of the NSA).

## Even if you've ripped out your laptop's mic, hackers can listen in through your headphones

-  The attack targets people who have already taken the paranoid step (once demonstrated by Edward Snowden) of ripping out their laptop's mic; but when such a person is targeted, the attack can work silently and without any outward indication; it relies on the fact that headphones' membranes vibrate in the presence of external sound (just like mics' membranes) and the magnets in headphones convert those vibrations to electrical signals that can be detected by the headphone jack.

-  Until then, paranoiacs take note: If determined hackers are out to bug your conversations, all your careful microphone removal surgery isnt quite enoughyoull also need to unplug that pair of cheap earbuds hanging around your neck.

## Twitter accidentally suspends its own CEO's account

- That prompted speculation his account might have been hacked or automatically shut down because of a high number of complaints from other users.

-   That provoked angry responses from some people who asked how many regular users' accounts might also have been accidentally frozen by the company in the past.

-   Related: Twitter launches new tools to fight harassment   Some parts of his account, which uses the handle @jack, were taking a while to get back to normal.

-   Soon after Dorsey was reinstated, his number of followers was showing up as only about 145 -- a steep drop from the roughly 3.9 million he had previously.

- The platform has struggled to find a healthy balance between allowing free speech and protecting users from harassment.

## NISTs new password rules  what you need to know

- Favor the user. To begin with, make your password policies user friendly and put the burden on the verifier when possible.

- Size matters. At least it does when it comes to passwords. NISTs new guidelines say you need a minimum of 8 characters. (Thats not a maximum minimum  you can increase the minimum password length for more sensitive accounts.)

- NIST says you should allow a maximum length of at least 64, so no more Sorry, your password cant be longer than 16 characters.

- Applications must allow all printable ASCII characters, including spaces, and should accept all UNICODE characters, too, including emoji!

- Check new passwords against a dictionary of known-bad choices. You dont want to let people use ChangeMe, thisisapassword, yankees, and so on.

- No composition rules. What this means is, no more rules that force you to use particular characters or combinations, like those daunting conditions

- No password hints. None.

- Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is out. KBA is when a site says, Pick from a list of questions  Where did you attend high school? Whats your favourite football team?

- No more expiration without reason. This is my favourite piece of advice: If we want users to comply and choose long, hard-to-guess passwords, we shouldnt make them change those passwords unnecessarily.

- All passwords must be hashed, salted and stretched,

- You need a salt of 32 bits or more, a keyed HMAC hash using SHA-1, SHA-2 or SHA-3, and the stretching algorithm PBKDF2 with at least 10,000 iterations.

- Additionally, and this is a big change: SMS should no longer be used in two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Malicious Video Link Can Cause Any iOS Device To Freeze

- We won't link the infectious video here for obvious reasons, but you can take our word for it when we say that it really does render your device unusable.

- The likely reason is that it's simply a corrupted video that's some sort of memory leak and when played, iOS isn't sure how to properly handle it, but there's like more to it than that.

- Because of the nature of the flaw, it isn't specific to a certain iOS build.

- Interestingly, with iOS 10.2 beta 3, if you let an iPhone affected by the bug sit there for long enough, it will power off and indefinitely display the spinning wheel that you normally see during the shutdown process.

- If someone sends you the malicious link and you fall for it, this is luckily a pretty easy problem to fix.

- PC Magazine reports:  "Just in time for the Black Friday swarms, we're adding a real-time look at how crowded a place is right now, to help you decide where and when to go," Google Product Manager Jamie Aspinall wrote in a blog post.

- "Whether you're rushing to pick up a last-minute gift or seeking a lively bar for some festive spirit, check Popular Times for a sneak preview of what to expect when you arrive."

- "After all, you want to be sure you leave enough time to enjoy a cup of hot chocolate at your local sweets shop before heading to your dinner reservations," Aspinall pointed out.

-  In addition, Google will be able to deliver more accurate business hours for your favorite establishments.

- "You'll know what time to pop by the pharmacy..., when food delivery begins at a nearby restaurant..., and what the service hours are at the auto dealership," Aspinall wrote.

## Tor phone is antidote to Google hostility over Android, says developer

- Users can punch a hole through the firewall for voice traffic, for instance, to enable Signal. The prototype only works on Google Nexus and Pixel hardware, as these are the only Android device lines, Perry wrote, that "support Verified Boot with user-controlled keys."

- While strong Linux geekcraft is required to install and maintain the prototype, Perry stressed that the phone is also aimed at provoking discussion about what he described as "Google's increasing hostility towards Android as a fully Open Source platform.

- " Perry also worried aloud about targeted backdoors delivered to specific users. "The iOS App Store is at a significant disadvantage there even compared to Google Play," he told us.

- "Copperhead has also extended this protection by preventing system applications from being overridden by Google Play Store apps, or from writing bytecode to writable partitions (where it could be modified and infected).

- Perry said he uses the prototype himself for his personal communications: "E-mail, Signal, XMPP+OTR, Mumble, offline maps and directions in OSMAnd, taking pictures, and reading news and books.

## This security camera was infected by malware 98 seconds after it was plugged in

-  Heres an object lesson on the poor state of the so-called Internet of Things: Robert Stephens plugged a Wi-Fi-connected security camera into his network and it was compromised in... 98 seconds. Stephens, a tech industry veteran, wasnt so naive as to do this without protecting himself.

- It was walled off from the rest of the network and rate-limited so it couldnt participate in any DDoS attacks. He monitored its traffic carefully, expecting to see  as others have  attempts to take over the device.

-  Ninety-eight seconds after it jumped on the Wi-Fi, the camera was attacked by a Mirai-like worm that knew the default login and password.

- The worm (its advance agent, really) checked the specs of its new home and then downloaded the rest of itself onto the device and, had Stephens not locked it down beforehand, would then be ready to participate in all manner of online shenanigans. The camera, a cheap off-brand one from a company that sells smartwatches for $12, isnt exactly best-in-class.

- This type of thing could be fixed with a firmware update or, in some cases, by simply changing the default password, but not everyone knows to do that, and even the most tech-savvy people might not get that done in two minutes. Better-quality devices will almost certainly be better protected against this kind of thing, and may for example block all incoming traffic until theyre paired with another device and set up manually.

- By working with Microsoft, Gonzalez said FireEye is now able to offer "differentiated intelligence" within WDATP and together help make organisations more secure.

- "With the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, we added this new layer of defence with WDATP - a new built-in OS sensor combined with powerful cloud-powered behavioural detection analytics - in order to help enterprises, detect, investigate and respond to targeted attacks and data breaches on their endpoints quicker and easier, added, Windows Cyber Defence, general manager, Moti Gindi.

## Qubes OS Project To Focus On Enterprise Support For Financial Sustainability

- Qubes OS was first launched in 2010, and since then its been mainly funded through consulting and RD contracts obtained by the project creators security company, Invisible Things Labs.

- The OTF has also funded projects such as the end-to-end encrypted Signal app and Subgraph OS, another privacy and security-focused operating system.

- The Qubes OS team also tried to make some money from selling support for Windows AppVMs, but that idea ultimately failed.

- As Edward Snowdens operating system of choice due to its focus on security through VM isolation, and after so many data breaches making headlines lately, Qubes OS is likely to find some success with companies that want to prioritize strong end-point security.

- The team wanted to note that Qubes OS will always remain open source, even if some features will need to be reworked to fit some enterprise customers needs.

## OnionScan Report: This One Weird Trick Can Reveal Information from 25% of the Dark Web

- In this report we will examine how a small change to a regular HTTP request can reveal information, and sometimes deanonymize a large number of hidden services.

- When providing generalised numbers, especially percentages, we report approximate figures based on multiple scans over a period of time, rather than a single snapshot.

- We recently talked about Hostname Hacking a technique that exploits misconfigured virtual hosts on a web server to trick a hidden service into reveal some more information about itself.

- This modification is not enough to fully exploit the site in many cases, but a difference in response tells us that virtual hosts are unlikely to be configured correctly.

- Unlike Apache mod_status leaks, hostname hacking affects all major web servers including nginx  lighttpd.

- Although, I will more than likely develop and include a Python scanning engine as well for those that don't want to take the time to wrap the lists in something of their own.

- This allows the scanning engine to use this comment as metadata, while not complicating how signatures are created and used.

## Edward Snowden Loses Norway Safe Passage Case

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from BBC: Edward Snowden's bid to guarantee that he would not be extradited to the U.S. if he visited Norway has been rejected by the Norwegian supreme court.

- The former spy contractor filed the lawsuit in April, attempting to secure safe passage to Norway to pick up a free speech award.

- Mr Snowden's lawyers have previously said if he were extradited to the U.S., it would be "a foregone conclusion" that he would be convicted and jailed.

- He had hoped to travel to Oslo to receive the Ossietzky Prize, for "outstanding efforts for freedom of expression."

- But the Norwegian Supreme Court said it could not rule on the legality of any move to extradite Mr Snowden as the U.S. had so far made no such request.

## Google Successfully Uses Machine Learning To Detect Diabetic Retinopathy

- BrianFagioli writes from a report via BetaNews: Diabetic eye disease is caused by retinopathy.

- Affected diabetics can have small tears inside the eye, causing bleeding.

- Not only are the computers able to detect the disease at the same level as ophthalmologists, but Google is actually slightly better! "A few years ago, a Google research team began studying whether machine learning could be used to screen for diabetic retinopathy (DR).

- Today, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, we've published our results: a deep learning algorithm capable of interpreting signs of DR in retinal photographs, potentially helping doctors screen more patients, especially in underserved communities with limited resources," says Lily Peng, MD Ph.D., Product Manger at Google.

- She goes on to say "our algorithm performs on par with the ophthalmologists, achieving both high sensitivity and specificity.

## Queen signs the Investigatory Powers Act into UK law

- IPBill Queen Elizabeth II today signs off on Parliament's Investigatory Powers Act, officially making it law in the UK. Her Maj not only had the last word on the new legislation  aka the Snoopers' Charter  she had the first.

- A first draft of the Investigatory Powers Bill was published six months later, alongside a confession that successive British governments had been issuing secret directives to telcos to intercept Brits' communications anyway. Many were pleased such secret surveillance was now being explicitly codified. Prime Minister Theresa May  then Home Secretary  claimed that it only introduced the one new power: "requiring communications service providers to retain internet connection records when given a notice by the Secretary of State.

- Police forces, local councils, intelligence services, government agencies, and more, are authorized to request the data from internet providers. Legal challenges against the bill are already under way, with members of the Don't Spy on Us coalition continuing their involvement in legal action against the proposed mass surveillance powers.

- Instead they open every detail of every citizen's online life up to state eyes, drowning the authorities in data and putting innocent people's personal information at massive risk.

- " He continued: "Although there are some improvements to oversight, the Bill will mean the police and intelligence agencies have unprecedented powers to surveil our private communications and Internet activity, whether or not we are suspected of a crime.

## Mozilla hackers audit cURL file transfer toolkit, give it a tick for security

- Mozilla has given the widely-used cURL file transfer library a thumbs up in a security audit report that uncovered nine vulnerabilities. Of those found in the free security review were four high severity vulnerabilities leading to potential remote code execution, and the same number of medium risk bugs.

- " Stenberg says he applied for the audit fearing a recent run of security vulnerability reports may have pointed to undiscovered underlying problems. The report was finished 23 September and fixes produced over the ensuing months. The developer says fewer checks and possible borked patches may result from the decision to audit in secret. "One of the primary [downsides] is that we get much fewer eyes on the fixes and there arent that many people involved when discussing solutions or approaches to the issues at hand," Stenberg says. "Another is that our test infrastructure is made for and runs only public code [which] cant really be fully tested until it is merged into the public git repository."

-   Audit vulnerabilities:   CRL -01-021 UAF via insufficient locking for shared cookies ( High)

- CRL -01-009 Double - free in krb 5 read _ data () due to missing realloc () check ( High)

- CRL -01-014 Negative array index via integer overflow in unescape _ word () ( High)

## Microsoft Update Servers Left All Azure RHEL Instances Hackable

- An anonymous reader shares a report on The Register: Microsoft has patched flaws that attackers could exploit to compromise all Azure Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instances.

- Software engineer Ian Duffy found the flaws while building a secure RHEL image for Microsoft Azure.

- During that process he noticed an installation script Azure uses in its preconfigured RPM Package Manager contains build host information that allows attackers to find all four Red Hat Update Appliances which expose REST APIs over HTTPS.

- From there Duffy found a package labeled PrepareRHUI (Red Hat Update Infrastructure) that runs on all Azure RHEL boxes, and contains the rhui-monitor.cloud build host.

- Duffy says all Azure RHEL images are configured without GPG validation checks meaning all would accept malicious package updates on their next run of yum updates.

## Android Malware Used To Hack and Steal Tesla Car

- By leveraging security flaws in the Tesla Android app, an attacker can steal Tesla cars

- This malicious app can use many of the freely available Android rooting exploits to take over the user's phone, steal the OAuth token from the Tesla app and the user's login credentials

- This is possible because the Tesla Android app stores the OAuth token in cleartext, and contains no reverse-engineering protection, allowing attackers to alter the app's source code and log user credentials

- The OAuth token and Tesla owner's password allow an attacker to perform a variety of actions, such as opening the car's doors and starting the motor.

## Muni system hacker hit others by scanning for year-old Java vulnerability

- In an e-mail to Ars, SFMTA spokesperson Paul Rose said that on November 25, "we became aware of a potential security issue with our computer systems, including e-mail."

- Based on communications uncovered from the ransomware operator behind the Muni attack published by security reporter Brian Krebs, an SFMTA Web-facing server was likely compromised by what is referred to as a "deserialization" attack after it was identified by a vulnerability scan. A screen at a Muni train station shows the malware message from HDDCryptor.Blorq, via Reddit A security researcher told Krebs that he had been able to gain access to the mailbox used in the malware attack on the Russian e-mail and search provider Yandex by guessing its owner's security question, and he provided details from the mailbox and another linked mailbox on Yandex.

- In response, the ransomware operator sent a link to a November 2015 advisory from Oracle regarding a vulnerability in the Apache Commons library of server-side Java components. That vulnerability, which uses maliciously crafted data objects to exploit how the affected libraries "deserialize" them to unpack them for processing, is the same class of vulnerability used to attack MedStar, the Maryland health system that had multiple hospitals lose access to critical systems in April as the result of a ransomware attack.

- In that case, the attacker (who deployed Samsam crypto-ransomware across MedStar's network) also apparently used an open source vulnerability scanning tool (JexBoss) to find and compromise a server running the open source JBoss platform. Rose told Ars that ticket machines for Muni trains were not directly affected by the ransomware.

- "In coordination with our partners at Cubic Transportation Systems, which operates [the ticketing kiosk system] Clipper, we took the precaution of turning off the ticket machines and faregates in the Muni Metro subway stations, starting on Friday until 9am Sunday," he wrote.

## Inside Android's source code... // TODO  Finish file encryption later

- One problem with Google's approach, Green said, is that "there is no unambiguous way for Android to tell applications when the system has been re-locked."

- For Green, the problem is not so much Google's technology as that its lack of developer guidance prevents developers from creating apps that handle locked devices properly.

- Apple approached the problem from a different angle. Starting with iOS 4, Apple implemented file-based encryption, protecting each file individually with its own unique key

## Android N Encryption

-  Over the past few years weve heard more about smartphone encryption than, quite frankly, most of us expected to hear in a lifetime.

- In practice this means that  after you enter a passcode once after boot  normal users spend their whole day walking around with all their cryptographic keys in RAM.

- In principle, a clever implementation could evict sensitive cryptographic keys from RAM when the device locks, then re-derive them the next time the user logs in.

- The available protection classes include:  Complete protection. Files encrypted with this class key can only be accessed when the device is powered up and unlocked.

- In other words, in 2016 Android is still struggling to deploy encryption that achieves (lock screen) security that Apple figured out six years ago.

## Mission Improbable: Hardening Android for Security And Privacy

- While I use it myself for my personal communications, it has some rough edges, and installation and update will require familiarity with Linux. The prototype is also meant to show that it is still possible to replace and modify your mobile phone's operating system while retaining verified boot security - though only just barely.

- The Android ecosystem is moving very fast, and in this rapid development, we are concerned that the freedom of users to use, study, share, and improve the operating system software on their phones is being threatened.

- Coppherhead has also extended this protection by preventing system applications from being overridden by Google Play Store apps, or from writing bytecode to writable partitions (where it could be modified and infected).

- We believe that more transparent development and release processes, along with deals for longer device firmware support from SoC vendors, would go a long way to ensuring that it is easier for good OEM players to stay up to date.

- They should use their competitive position to encourage/enforce good OEM behavior, not to create barriers and bandaids that end up enabling yet more fragmentation due to out of date (and insecure) devices. It is for this reason that we believe that projects like Copperhead are incredibly important to support.

## mjg59 | Tor, TPMs and service integrity attestation

- scared that remote services would start refusing to work for users who weren't running (for instance) an approved version of Windows with a verifiable DRM stack.

- Some enterprises use it as part of their VPN login process, and we've been working on it at CoreOS to enable Kubernetes clusters to verify that workers are in a trustworthy state before running jobs on them.

- CoreOS ships with an expected set of good values, and we had general agreement at the Linux Plumbers Conference that other distributions would start looking at what it would take to do the same.

- Instead, let's imagine an immutable OS that does nothing other than bring up networking and then reads a config file that tells it which container images to download and run.

- Let's handwave this for now, or assert that we'll have some sidechannel for distributing valid firmware values.Avoiding TPM MITMingThis one's more interesting.

## IoT worm can hack Philips Hue lightbulbs, spread across cities

- Researchers have developed a proof-of-concept worm they say can rip through Philips Hue lightbulbs across entire cities  causing the insecure web-connected globes to flick on and off. The software nasty, detailed in a paper titled IoT Goes Nuclear: Creating a ZigBee Chain Reaction [PDF], exploits hardcoded symmetric encryption keys to control devices over Zigbee wireless networks.

- The worm can then spread from a single smart bulb to those nearby thanks to the use of these skeleton keys. The attack is the handiwork of researchers Eyal Ronen, Adi Shamir, and Achi-Or Weingarten of the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, along with Colin O'Flynn of Dalhousie University, Canada. It triggered Philips to release a firmware patch for owners of its "Hue" connected bulbs.

- " The quartet found the Philips Hue update mechanism, while requiring some cryptographic validation, was flawed in that the AES-CCM keys universal to all Hue lightbulbs could be extracted using a side-channel attack. (We note that, in general, a side-channel attack isn't needed to crack an embedded device that uses symmetrical keys: these hardcoded secrets can be extracted from the firmware data.

- ) Here's how the team described their malware: The worm spreads by jumping directly from one lamp to its neighbors, using only their built-in ZigBee wireless connectivity and their physical proximity.

- They found a test mode within the globes' 2.4Ghz spectrum band could "easily" disrupt nearby wifi networks. "This demonstrates once again how difficult it is to get security right even for a large company that uses standard cryptographic techniques to protect a major product," the team says.

## Leave your phone at the door: side channels that reveal factory floor secrets

- If thats all too much hassle, you just need to know the phone number of an employee who works the machine, call them up, and keep them talking for a while! Milling and printing  As no single paper can reconstruct all process parameters for all major types of equipment, we focus on key parameters related to the location of the tool head with respect to the object being fabricated and its direction of travel.

- Figure 6 shows that most of the information needed to decide what angle the machine is moving at is concentrated at low frequency bands.

-  Experimental results The team conducted tests with a variety of Android devices, and found that the Samsung Galaxy S6 worked best.

- Good audio data can even be captured in the background of a phone call placed or received on the factory floor.

## Neutralizing Intels Management Engine

- The ME can be used remotely even if the PC is powered off.

- If that sounds scary, it gets even worse: no one knows what the ME is doing, and we cant even look at the code

- When  not if  the ME is finally cracked open, every computer running on a recent Intel chip will have a huge security and privacy issue

- Intels Management Engine is the single most dangerous piece of computer hardware ever created.

- With a BeagleBone, an SOIC-8 chip clip, and a few breakout wires, this script will run and effectively disable the ME.

- This exploit has only been confirmed to work on Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge processors. It should work on Skylake processors, and Haswell and Broadwell are untested.

## When CSI meets public wifi: Inferring your mobile phone password via wifi signals

- Liu et al. applied a similar idea to use a smart watch to track hand movements over a keyboard, and achieve 65% recognition accuracy.

- With the traffic meta data, WindTalker obtains the rough start time and end point of the Sensitive Input Window via searching packets whose destination is 110.75.xx.xx.

- This is achieved using a low-pass filter to remove high frequency noise, since the variations in CSI waveforms caused by finger motion lie at the low end of the spectrum.

- But the pre-training required is very minimal, with just one sample of a given keystroke, recovery rate is as high as 68.3%.  In practice, the attackers have more choices to achieve the user specific training.

- For example, they can simply offer the user free WiFi access and, as the return, the victim should finish the online training by clicking the designated numbers.

## Gone in 70 seconds: Holding Enter key can smash through defense

- Attackers can copy, modify or destroy the hard disc as well as set up the network to exfiltrate data.

- This vulnerability is especially serious in environments like libraries, ATMs, airport machines, labs, etc, where the whole boot process is protect (password in BIOS and GRUB) and we only have a keyboard or/and a mouse.  The "very reliable" exploit has been patched and a workaround developed that shutters the hack, according to Marco and Ripoll.

- Red Hat has rated the programming blunder (CVE-2016-4484) as "moderate", noting: The attacker needs to have physical access to the machine in order to exploit this flaw.

- The attack consists of gaining access to the shell after wrong LUKS password has been entered during the boot process.

- The contents of the drive can also be copied off to do conduct offline brute force attacks on another computer. Essentially, this is perfect for someone who has stolen or seized your machine, or wants to cause criminal mischief on computers in public spaces.

## Google's Project Zero tweaking Microsoft, because it did fix a bug

- For once, a Google Project Zero bug report to Microsoft has resulted in a fix without a public spat.

- Indeed, this fix happened without any public announcement at all. Back in 2014, Project Zero's James Forshaw told Redmond he'd found a Windows Kernel Object Manager bug that permitted a limited bypass of traverse permissions  because it enabled a Chrome sandbox escape.  

- The problem was in how the SeFastTraverseCheck method's behaviour, and Forshaw originally said he didn't really expect this will be considered a bulletin class issue, if it's considered an issue at all. He was right: a year later, he opened the post because Redmond put it in the won't fix basket  but sometime since 2015, a fix happened, which Forshaw notes explains what he first saw. It turns out the bug was in another component, SeCreateAccessState: SeFastTraverseCheck is doing a check for the TOKEN_IS_RESTRICTED flag and failing early (which would lead to a bypass of traversal privileges for Chrome etc.)

- however SeCreateAccessState was never setting that flag in the ACCESS_STATE Flags member which means that the check was bypassed. The fix would have passed entirely without notice, had Foreshaw been able to resist taking a dig at Microsoft:  Got to love silent fixes (https://t.co/A1dzgYzuwQ).

- Any comment @msftsecresponse?  James Forshaw (@tiraniddo) November 30, 2016 His post on the Chrome blog nails the fix as necessary as far back as November 2015, Windows 10 build 10586.

- For at least the past six months, a popular remote management app available in the official Google Play Store has opened tens of millions of Android users to code-execution and data-theft attacks when they use unsecured networks, researchers said Thursday. As recently as earlier this weekand possibly even at this momentthe most up-to-date versions of AirDroid have used a static and easily detectable encryption key when transmitting update files and sensitive user data, according to a blog post published by security firm Zimperium.

- Attackers who are on the same network can exploit the weakness to push fraudulent updates or view potentially sensitive user information, including the international mobile equipment identity and international mobile subscriber identity designations that are unique to each phone.

- The app has been downloaded 10 million to 50 million times from the official Google Play Store. "A malicious party on the same network as the victim can leverage this vulnerability to remotely gain full control of their device," Simone Margaritelli, principal security researcher at Zimperium's zLabs, told Ars.

- Zimperium's analysis of that release, AirDroid version 4.0, showed that the app remained vulnerable, a finding that resulted in Thursday's disclosure of the weakness. While application sandboxing built into the Android operating system can limit the access malicious apps have, there are a few reasons why the attack Zimperium has demonstrated remains a serious threat.

- What's more, an attacker pushing a malicious update could augment those rights as long as the end user clicked an OK button when receiving a fake notification that an update was available. And while use of a virtual private networking app while connected to an unsecured network may provide a layer of protection, there may still be ways for attackers to bypass it.

## The status of kernel hardening [LWN.net]

-  Linus asked how much plugins would slow the kernel build process; linux-next maintainer Stephen Rothwell also expressed interest in that question, noting that "some of us do compiles all day."

- Andi Kleen suggested just doing the link randomization and dropping KASLR altogether; the kernel's addresses tend to leak via all kinds of paths anyway.

- [...] In general, the kernel shouldn't care about that ordering, and changing it should not have performance effects.  If reordering results in members not being aligned, the struct's memory footprint will grow.

- [...] In general, the kernel shouldn't care about that ordering, and changing it should not have performance effects.  If reordering results in members not being aligned, the struct's memory footprint will grow.

- your insinuated ad hominem aside, you guys completely lost track of the problem here: it's about you making demands on our free time (PaX/grsecurity have been hobby projects) and then blame us that the universe didn't give us more than 24h of it in a day.

## Cyanogen Inc and CyanogenMod Creator Steve Kondik Part Ways

- It is unclear what this means for the future of CyanogenMod. NDTV reports: "Kondik took to the official CyanogenMod developer Google+ community recently where he voiced what he thought were the reasons behind Cyanogen's plight and blamed Kirt McMaster, Cyanogen's Co-Founder.

- 'I've been pretty quiet about the stuff that's been going on but I'm at least ready to tell the short version and hopefully get some input on what to do next because CM is very much affected,' wrote Kondik in a private Google+ community first reported by Android Police.

- This is when the 'bullet to the head' and other misguided media nonsense started, and the bad business deals were signed.

- The worst of it happened internally and it became a generally shitty place to work because of all the conflict.

- Kondik also seemingly confirmed a report from July which claimed Cyanogen may pivot to apps.

## How Developers Are Responding to Ethereum's Unexpected Fork

-  An unintentional split of the network was the latest event to shake ethereum. By now, you might have heard the back-and-forth about so-called hard forks, a particularly contentious way to update a public blockchain.

- Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, went as far as to call these recent challenges a "crisis of identity.

- " From the mid-summer unravelling of The DAO to an unknown hacker spamming the network to the point where users couldnt complete smart contracts, its been a rough few months for the smart contract platform. Yet ethereum developers have struck an optimistic tone, seemingly viewing the Thanksgiving fork as another learning experience and a chance to make the network better. Developer response Those involved with the project say that the team is looking to take steps in order to prevent future occurrences. "This time, the fork was detected within 6 minutes, which was a bit lucky," Ethereum Foundation security lead Martin Holst Swende told CoinDesk. Because developers might not always accidentally spot the problem in such a short time frame, they want to make sure that they're able to react quickly in a similar situation. "We're working on improving our capabilities for detection, analysis, communication/coordination between teams, Swende said. He added that theyre working on a "Post Mortem" report, outlining lessons learned from various ethereum bugs, which they aim to open up to the public soon. One step being taken will involve making time for added testing of "non-critical" forks, or those that dont need to be executed immediately. Ethereum Foundation media relations lead Hudson Jameson noted that developers also plan to overhaul the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), a process by which developers propose new ecosystem standards or changes to the ethereum protocol. "There is also plans to eventually create an alternative web interface for listing EIPs so it will be easier for the average user to view EIPs without having to navigate a GitHub repo, which can be confusing at times," he explained. Fixing the fork and beyond There have been three other forks recently. The last technical fork, Spurious Dragon, fixed a few different ethereum issues, including the deletion of the empty accounts that the attacker used to spam the blockchain. Over the past week, developers have been using this newly granted power to delete all of these empty accounts, thus "debloating" the blockchain (a process that was officially completed on Wednesday).

- So, the network temporarily split into two. The latest version of Geth, released the day of the fork, fixed the problem. "If you do not update, please be aware you will be on an invalid chain that is not supported," ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin wrote in response.

- If theres a slip up (in ethereums case, small disagreements of how to delete the empty accounts), the network could split. ChromaWay co-founder and CTO Alex Mizrahi argued recently that while multiple implementations might be considered a good thing in other instances, the risk of monetary loss showcases why it might not be appropriate for cryptocurrencies. So, some argue that a fork was an inevitable result, but since bitcoin and ethereum networks are perceived as competitors, its hard to determine the honesty behind this analysis. Since ethereum doesnt a wide user base, it might not have impacted that many people.

## Mozilla and Tor release urgent update for Firefox 0-day under active attack

- Developers with Tor have published a browser update that patches a critical Firefox vulnerability being actively exploited to deanonymize people using the privacy service. "The security flaw responsible for this urgent release is already actively exploited on Windows systems," a Tor official wrote in an advisory published Wednesday afternoon.

- "Even though there is currently, to the best of our knowledge, no similar exploit for OS X or Linux users available, the underlying bug affects those platforms as well.

- Mozilla officials said on Tuesday they were in the process of developing a fix that presumably included mainstream versions of Firefox, but at the time this post was being prepared, a patch was not yet available.

- Mozilla representatives didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment for this post. Attack code exploiting a use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox first circulated Tuesday on a Tor discussion list and was quickly confirmed as a zero-day, the term given to vulnerabilities that are actively exploited in the wild before the developer has a patch in place.

- The malicious payload delivered is almost identical to one the FBI used in 2013 to identify people who were trading child pornography on a Tor-anonymized website.

## Politicians exempt themselves from new wide-ranging spying laws

- That applies to people wanting to see someone's full internet browsing history, for instance, which is one of the things that will be collected under the new law.

- Earlier in the process, the only amendment that MPs had submitted was one that would allow extra safeguards for politicians  forcing any request to monitor MP's communications to go through the speaker of the House of Commons as well as the prime minister.

- Whether intelligence agencies should be allowed to spy on politicians has been a contentious part of recent surveillance legislation.

- For many years, discussions between politicians and their constituents had been treated as off-limits  and they are still seen as "sensitive" under the new legislation  but those protections have been gradually rolled back.

- Internet connection records  a history of every website that someone has visited, but not every page  will still be collected for MPs, since they will be done en masse by internet providers for all of their customers.

## Fatal flaws in ten pacemakers make for Denial of Life attacks

- A global research team has hacked 10 different types of implantable medical devices and pacemakers finding exploits that could allow wireless remote attackers to kill victims. Eduard Marin and Dave Singelee, researchers with KU Leuven University, Belgium, began examining the pacemakers under black box testing conditions in which they had no prior knowledge or special access to the devices, and used commercial off-the-shelf equipment to break the proprietary communications protocols.  

- From the position of blind attackers the pair managed to hack pacemakers from up to five metres away gaining the ability to deliver fatal shocks and turn off life-saving treatment. The wireless attacks could also breach patient privacy, reading device information disclosing location history, treatments, and current state of health. Singelee told The Register the pair has probed implantable medical device and pacemakers, along with insulin pumps and neurostimulators in a bid to improve security understanding and develop lightweight countermeasures. "So we wanted to see if these wireless attacks would be possible on these newer types of pacemakers, as this would show that there are still security problems almost 10 years after the initial security flaws have been discovered, and because the impact of breaking the long-range wireless communication channel would be much larger as adversaries can be further away from their victim," Singelee says. "We deliberately followed a black-box approach mimicking a less-skilled adversary that has no prior knowledge about the specification of the system. "Using this black-box approach we just listened to the wireless communication channel and reverse-engineered the proprietary communication protocol.

- Laboratory setup: A USRP (left) and DAQ with antennas below.  Their work is detailed in the On the (in)security of the Latest Generation Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators and How to Secure Them [PDF] authored by Marin and Singelee, KU Leven colleague Bart Preneel, Flavio D. Garcia and Tom Chothia of the University of Birmingham, and cardiologist Rik Willems of University Hospital Gasthuisberg. The team describes in limited detail to protect patients how the wireless communications used to maintain the implantable medical devices can be breached. "Adversaries may eavesdrop the wireless channel to learn sensitive patient information, or even worse, send malicious messages to the implantable medical devices.

- This could "drastically reduce" the units' battery life, the team says. The research, like all medical device hacking, has scope limitations that mean mass targeting of pacemakers is not immediately possible.

- National Instruments sells its URSP-2920 for US$3670 (2930, A$4972) and USB-6353 for US$2886 (2724, A$3910). The team tells The Register they have been informed that the compromised vendor has issued a patch, but further details are not known. Medical devices' wireless could be jammed as a stop-gap measure, while the addition of shutdown commands to the devices would best serve long-term fix, as would the inclusion of standard symmetric key authentication. "We want to emphasise that reverse engineering was possible by only using a black-box approach," the team says.

## WikiLeaks Public Donation Address Receives 4000th Bitcoin

- The nonprofit whistle blower site, which to a large extent relies on donations, reached this milestone on November 12, with well over 25,000 incoming transactions over five years time.

- Shortly after the release of classified U.S. diplomatic cables in November 2010, all donations to WikiLeaks were blocked by major payment providers, including Bank of America, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union.

- On a Bitcointalk thread that was started shortly after the banking blockade was initiated, several forum members  including Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto  argued it was too early in Bitcoins life to be associated with an organization like WikiLeaks.No, don't bring it on, Nakamoto posted in response to another forum member arguing in favor of donating to WikiLeaks.

- You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.A PC World article published soon after suggested the same idea, once again to the dismay of Bitcoins inventor.It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context, he wrote.

- In his book When Google Met WikiLeaks, Assange explained, WikiLeaks read and agreed with Satoshis analysis, and decided to put off the launch of a Bitcoin donation channel until the currency had become more established.

## Consensus without Trust: Cryptographic Enforcement of Distributed Protocols

- Non-malicious DDOSes happen all of the time as well, where a small site is linked by a major news organization and suddenly has hundreds of dollars in hosting charges from their provider.

- Sometimes ordinary client servers can be promoted to these roles, but a decentralized system typically places a lot of trust in these supervisors.

- Clock skew, network issues, power loss, and data corruption can all work to counter the usefulness of real-world time.

- If there are verifiable semantics for the data then it's worth noting that the chance of finding a hash collision that looks like it "makes sense" is astronomically low.

- If I want to check if a piece of data is located in a tree which is an order of magnitude larger than my local storage, I must ask the cluster of untrusted peers.

## Court Rules IRS Can Seek Information on Bitcoin Customers

- A federal court on Wednesday ruled that the Internal Revenue Service can serve digital-currency-services company Coinbase with a John Doe summons that seeks detailed information on its customers transactions from 2013 to 2015. The IRS and the Justice Department are looking for information about the use of the digital currency bitcoin and the possibility that it has been used to evade federal tax laws over the three-year period.

- As we previously stated, we remain concerned with our U.S. customers legitimate privacy rights in the face of the governments sweeping request. Coinbase, founded in 2012 and based in San Francisco, offers wallet services for its customers, essentially online accounts for holding and trading bitcoin.

- The digital currency is maintained by a distributed network of computers and isnt backed by any government or central agency.

-   According to a Wall Street Journal article in 2015, the John Doe summons allows the IRS to obtain information about all taxpayers in a certain group, even if the agency doesnt know their identities.

- It was recently trading around $742, up about 1% on the day. Two other prominent startups that offer digital-currency services, Blockchain.info and Circle, said they havent heard from the IRS, but their business models are somewhat different from Coinbases, which may explain why they havent been contacted.

## SHIFT + F10, Linux gets you Windows 10's cleartext BitLocker key

- Microsoft is working on a patch for a bug or feature in Windows 10 that allowed access to the command line and, using a live Linux .ISO, made it possible steal BitLocker keys during OS updates. The command line interface bypasses BitLocker grants permits access to local drives , simply by tapping the Shift and F10 keys.  

- BitLocker encryption which is disabled as part of the Windows pre-installation environment. Exploitation scenarios are limited and users should not be overly alarmed, as attackers would need to have laptops in hand during the update, or be in a position to trigger an update in order to pop open the command line interface open. Noted Windows trainer and senior technical fellow with software house Adminize Sami Laiho reported the flaws to Microsoft and says Redmond is rushing out a fix. "There is a small but crazy bug in the way the feature update (formerly known as upgrade) is installed," Laiho says. "The installation of a new build is done by re-imaging the machine [via] Windows Pre-installation Environment [which] has a feature for troubleshooting that allows you to press SHIFT+F10 to get a command prompt. This sadly allows for access to the hard disk as during the upgrade Microsoft disables BitLocker. Regular updates are not affected. Worryingly, a security operations tech for an international enterprise environment told iThe Register attackers could use the mess to steal BitLocker's encryption keys by booting a live Linux image from the CLI.

- This works using a VMK copy known as a Clear Key that is written in cleartext to disk alongside other Protectors.

- The BitLocker unlock process immediately looks for these keys on boot and automatically uses those it finds. With Protectors disabled, Windows boots and accesses data from the volume as it if was not encrypted, warning users that BitLocker is disabled. Users can only create a Clear Key for this through the command line utility after the VMK is manually decrypted by someone who knows the password.  manage-bde C: -protectors -disable  Windows 8 and newer versions of Windows will re-enable the BitLocker Protectors and secure delete the Clear Key after one boot. The security tech says the function is handy for admins needing set and forget rebooting. From a SysAdmin perspective disabling the Protectors is very useful for performing unattended reboots," they say. "[The attack] was done during an operating system upgrade that required the disk to be accessed by a pre-boot environment which otherwise would not be able to get the Protector keys released from TPM.

- " A non-TPM Protector could be used instead, they say, but at a cost to user experience such as the 48-digit BitLocker volume Recovery Password, which could be easily misplaced as well. The only fix Laiho says works for now is to ensure Windows 10 boxes are physically secure during upgrades, which means doing next to nothing for the majority of users. Laiho has created a proof-of-concept video to demonstrate the bug.
