## Team CARAMBA

- In comparison, the "real" record for discrete logarithm is 768 bits (announced this spring) and required 10 times as much computational power.

- We chose the prime number which defines the problem to be solved in a special way, so that the computation can be made much more efficient.

- Our computation raises questions about some Internet standards that contain opaque, fixed primes.

- Discrete log is the computational hardness assumption underlying Diffie-Hellman key exchange and DSA digital signatures.

- If you are a developer or standards committee member, use verifiable randomness to generate any fixed cryptographic parameters, and publicly document your seeds.

## Senate Republicans were skimmed for six months, quietly fix store  nighly secure

- And subsequently sold on the dark web for $30.Update Oct 6th: The Republicans have rushed to secure their store today.

- And we have two Russian credit card harvesters with the rather boring names jquery-cloud.net (March) and jquery-code.su (October).Follow the moneyThe older harvester jquery-cloud.net was registered in December 2015 by an American lady with a Chinese fax number and a fake email address.

- The newer harvester, jquery-code.su, is registered anonymously per 24th of August.Both domain names are hosted by a company called Dataflow, as is shown by the nameservers and IP addresses.

- Curiously, the Dataflow network and the jquery-cloud.net domain name were created in the same week:route:          80.87.205.0/24 descr:          DDoS Protected Network DATAFLOW.SU origin:         AS203624 mnt-by:         MNT-DATAFLOWSU created:        2015-12-28T22:37:25Z A hornets nestDataflow has a Russian language website but is registered in Belize on November 3rd, 2015.

- It advertises with:Offshore [...] Solutions with protection from DDoS to 350 Gbit : Belize, Panama, SeychellesIts office is registered here: This address shows up in the Panama Papers and is - coincidentally - also the home of a trust office called Alpha Offshore, whois an international provider of legal corporate tax planning services.

## A Study of WebRTC Security

- During TURN communication the media can suffer a loss of quality and increased latency, but it allows an "if all else fails" scenario to permit WebRTC application to work even under challenging circumstances.

- Resultantly, the protections put in place through encryption are therefore not compromised during WebRTC communication over TURN, and the server cannot understand or modify information that peers send to each other.

- Note that in this case the level of "trust" that an Identity Provider possesses is subjective to the end-point user or service, and is often largely tied to userbase and reputation across the World Wide Web.

- Taken together with the previous provision, this allows ICE negotiation to start immediately upon an incoming call notification, thereby reducing delay, but also avoiding disclosing the user's IP address until they have decided to answer.

- Encryption in particular has become a big topic in recent years, following the growing awareness of major corporate hacking scandels and widespread government telecommunication eavesdropping.

## Active 4G LTE vulnerability allows hackers (and police) to eavesdrop on conversations, read texts, and track your smartphone location | Privacy Online News

- 4G LTE vulnerability that allows any dedicated attacker to intercept your calls and texts as well as track your location

- This 4G vulnerability is currently exploitable on any LTE network and is based off a little-known fail-safe that is supposed to only be used during emergencies,

- However, there might be a simpler reason as to why this 4G vulnerability is still active and there are no plans to fix it... One word: Stingray.

- this attack works by downgrading your LTE connection to a 3G connection and then finally to an un-secure 2G connection and then exploiting known vulnerabilities there

- this vulnerability might not have been patched because it may have something to do with a surveillance technique that is actively used by law enforcement or intelligence agents in areas without active cooperation of local law enforcemen

## vusec/drammer

- This software is the open-source component of our paper "Drammer: Deterministic Rowhammer Attacks on Mobile Devices", published in ACM Computer and Communications Security (CCS) 2016.

- The Makefile provides an install feature that uses the Android Debug Bridge (adb) to push the binary to your device's /data/local/tmp/ directory.

- If this still does not give you enough memory, I usually repeat the sequence of breaking with CTRL^C and restarting with -d3 again in favor of using a higher timeout value.

- Some big.LITTLE architectures require you to pin the program to a big core, to make sure memory accesses are as fast as possible. -r  The rowsize in bytes.

- The main output of a run consists of numbers that indicate the average DRAM access time (in nanoseconds).

## phishery A tool for harvesting credentials via Word docs with an SSL enabled basic auth dialog

- Specifically, setting the template to a remote url (as opposed to putting in an external image or something) is clever!

- I had been working as a software engineer for roughly 8 years prior to transitioning into the infosec field, so I have a good amount experience with many languages and Go is at the top list now :)

- Although they don't have an official bug bounty, if you responsibly disclose an RCE vulnerability to them, they might just thank you with more than a mention in a Security Bulletin.

- I suspect most staff of large enterprises are used to seeing basic authentication dialogs and mindlessly enter creds hoping like the the proxy will jsut work and their account isnt locked out for some reason.

- Protected View is definitely a pain, but it can be bypassed ;) the trick is delivering the Word doc in way that it doesn't get "The Mark of the Web".

## Show HN: TCP over sound on Android

- org.quietmodem.Quiet allows you to pass data through the speakers on your Android device. This library can operate either as a raw frame layer or as a UDP/TCP stack.

- This package contains prebuilt library files for libquiet and quiet-lwip as well as their dependencies. On top of that, it adds Java bindings which closely mimic the familiar interfaces from the java.net.* package.

- Quiet can be used either as a raw frame layer or in UDP/TCP mode. For the latter, it provides the lwIP TCP stack which operates entirely independently from the stack provided by Android.

## ComoD'oh! Infosec duo exploits OCR flaw to nab a website's HTTPS cert

- Two European security researchers exploited Comodos crappy backend systems to obtain a HTTPS certificate for a domain they do not own.

- found that the CA uses optical character recognition (OCR) software to process requests for certificates.

- This image-recognition system is designed to ensure server-side certs are only sent to the registered owner of that domain.

- Comodo uses OCR to parse screen grabs of records from domain-name registries or registrars when verifying the ownership of a website

- Thanks to shortfalls in the OCR system used, Comodo can fail to distinguish an authentic domain name from one with similar characters (such as the number 1 instead of the letter l) and end up giving valid certificates to owners of the fake domain.

## Dyn dinged by DDoS: US DNS firm gives web a bad hair day

- A denial of service attack against managed DNS provider Dyn restricted access to many US-based websites on Friday. The ongoing attack is affecting Dyns managed DNS customers on the US East Coast, according to the provider, which adds on its status page that its engineers are continuing to work on mitigating this issue. Starting at 11:10 UTC on October 21th-Friday 2016 we began monitoring and mitigating a DDoS attack against our Dyn Managed DNS infrastructure.

- Some customers may experience increased DNS query latency and delayed zone propagation during this time. The strength of the attack, as well as its source, remains unclear.

- Sites experiencing issues as a result of the attack include Github, Airbnb, Reddit, Freshbooks, Heroku and Vox Media properties.

- The sites themselves are fine but DNS lookups may be slow, leading to problems. Richard Meeus, VP technology EMEA at NSFOCUS, a DDoS mitigation company, commented: DNS has often been neglected in terms of its security and availability from an enterprise perspective  it is treated as if it will always be there in the same way that water comes out of the tap and electricity is there when you switch it on.  

- This attack highlights how critical DNS is to maintaining a stable and secure internet presence, and that the DDOS mitigation processes businesses have in place are just as relevant to their DNS service as it is to the web servers and data centres, he added.

Please follow instructions.

- "A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system." (RH)

## US DNC hackers blew through SIX zero-days vulns last year alone

- Security researchers have shone fresh light on the allegedly Russian state-sponsored hacking crew blamed for ransacking the US Democratic National Committee's computers. Sednit  also known as APT28, Fancy Bear and Sofacy  has been operating since 2004.

- The cyber-mob has reportedly infiltrated machines operated by targets as diverse as the DNC, the German parliament, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign boss John Podesta, former US Secretary of State Colin Powell, and the French TV network TV5Monde.  

- Thousands of emails with booby-trapped links to password-stealing phishing pages were sent out by the gang to victims, snaring anyone who followed the bit.ly- and tiny.cc-concealed URLs and handed over their login credentials. Sensitive documents and private emails taken from some of the hacking targets  notably the DNC and John Podesta  were leaked online via WikiLeaks and other sites.

- The crew also wields zero-day exploits to infect computer systems belonging to its targets, according to security researchers at ESET, the Slovakian IT security company: Most of the targets uncovered by ESET's research have Gmail addresses, the majority of which belong to individuals.

- "A run-of-the-mill criminal gang would be unlikely to make use of quite so many previously unknown, unpatched vulnerabilities because of the significant skill, time and resources required to properly uncover and exploit them," it concludes. The first part of ESET's planned three-part white paper into Sednit can be found here [PDF].

## Samsung is Setting Up Note 7 Exchange Booths at Airports Around the World

-  Samsung is Setting Up Note 7 Exchange Booths at Airports Around the World  (theverge.com) 

- An anonymous reader writes: Samsung is setting up Galaxy Note 7 exchange booths in airports around the world, hoping to stop customers taking the dangerous device onto flights at the last minute.

- The first of these new "customer service points" appear to have been introduced in South Korean airports, but Samsung has confirmed the booths are opening in airports across Australia, with reports of the desks appearing in the US as well.

- The booths are located in "high-traffic terminals" before security screening, says Samsung, and allow Note 7 owners to swap their phone for an unspecified exchange device.

- According to a report from ABC7News in San Francisco -- where a Samsung exchange desk has appeared at the city's international airport -- employees for the tech company are on hand to help customers transfer their data onto a new phone.

## Ecuador Acknowledges Limiting Julian Assange's Web Access

- Alexandra Valencia, reporting for Reuters: Ecuador's government acknowledged on Tuesday it had partly restricted internet access for Julian Assange, the founder of anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks who has lived in the South American country's London embassy since mid-2012.

- WikiLeaks said Assange lost connectivity on Sunday, sparking speculation Ecuador might have been pressured by the United States due to the group's publication of hacked material linked to U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

- In a statement, Ecuador's leftist government said WikiLeaks' decision to publish documents impacting the U.S. election campaign was entirely its own responsibility, and the South American country did not cede to pressure from other nations.

- "In that respect, Ecuador, exercising its sovereign right, has temporarily restricted access to part of its communications systems in its UK Embassy," it added in a statement.

- "The Ecuador government respects the principle of non-intervention in other countries' affairs, it does not meddle in election processes underway, nor does it support any candidate specially."

## If elected, Clinton would support an Encryption Commission to help feds

- " The Republican presidential candidate has given hints into his thinking in interviews and statements here and there, but taken together, they don't give a clear picture of what he would do to address the nations domestic surveillance and foreign intelligence concerns. While the Trump team's website has a slew of policy positions and fact sheets on various other topics listed, buried on the battleground states pages (like Ohio and North Carolina) is this two-sentence statement: There are serious threats facing the United States and American strength is the only way to ensure peace.

- so we can try to compel a whatsapp to unencrypt, but that may only have the effect of pushing terrorists onto emergent encrypted platforms. i do think going forward it will be helpful to be able to refer to her having pledged not to mandate a backdoor as president.

- So I don't think he should be brought home without facing the music. Say what? Given Trumps lack of a coherent policy, its not surprising that Silicon Valley has largely come out in favor of Clinton, who has earned endorsements from 150 tech executives and influential actors.

- She has been roundly criticized by her opponent and by top government officials, including FBI Director James Comey, who lambasted her decision but ultimately found that it was not worthy of criminal prosecution.

- Since then, Clinton has apologized for keeping the private server and said she would not do it again. "Clintons position is cautious, incremental, sober and boring: a cybersecurity third term for President Obama, Stewart Baker, the former top lawyer at the National Security Agency, told the Washington Post, in August 2016.

## Audit sees VeraCrypt kill critical password recovery, cipher flaws  The Register

- Security researchers have found eight critical, three medium, and 15 low -severity vulnerabilities in a one month audit of popular encryption platform VeraCrypt. The audit is the latest in a series prompted by the shock abandoning of TrueCrypt in May 2014 due to unspecified security concerns claimed by the hitherto trusted platform's mysterious authors.  

- This appears to stem from a failure to properly erase passwords when changed by users. Further critical errors include the implementation of the GOST 28147-89 symmetric block cipher which the pair say must be abandoned due to implementation errors.

- All compression libraries were considered outdated or "poorly-written". Researchers bankrolled by the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund on 1 August funded by DuckDuckGo and VikingVPN detailed their findings in a 42-page report (PDF). Critical and medium -severity flaws have been fixed in the latest VeraCrypt release version 1.19, along with most low risk vulnerabilities and concerns.

- Those that remain unfixed were left due to the high complexity of patching, but researchers have also proposed workarounds. VeraCrypt has since dumped GOST 28147-89 encryption allowing users to decrypt volumes but not create new instances using the cipher. Boot password flaws were also squashed along with four other bootloader problems.

- "VeraCrypt is much safer after this audit, and the fixes applied to the software mean that the world is safer when using this software," the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund says of the audit. The auditors say the review is useful and beneficial for users, but is too expensive to be conducted for every version of encryption tools.

## Japan to Drop 8% Bitcoin Sales Tax

- Japan is reportedly planning to exempt bitcoin and other virtual currencies from a national sales tax. The country's Financial Services Agency  its top finance regulator  along with the Ministry of Finance are deliberating on a possible exemption, according to regional news service Nikkei.

- Bitcoin purchases in Japan are currently subject to an 8% sales tax. "Discussions between the Finance Ministry and Financial Services Agency are expected to lead to a formal decision after talks by a ruling-coalition tax panel at the end of the year," the agency reported. According to the report, the government is planning to use legislation passed in May that classified bitcoin as a kind of prepaid payment instrument. The service further quoted an unnamed representative from a Japanese bitcoin exchange, who indicated that the move would significantly cut administrative costs. News that the government might be pulling back the sales tax comes months after a lawmaker from Japan's ruling political party, the Liberal Democratic Party, pushed for such an exemption.

- In March, Diet member Tsukasa Akimoto pushed Finance Minister Taro Aso to rescind the tax  a call that Aso reportedly pushed back on at the time. The FSA and the Japanese Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Image via Shutterstock

## Most serious Linux privilege-escalation bug ever is under active exploit

- For another, the flaw is located in a section of the Linux kernel that's a part of virtually every distribution of the open-source OS released for almost a decade.

- " As their names describe, privilege-escalation or privilege-elevation vulnerabilities allow attackers with only limited access to a targeted computer to gain much greater control.

- A SQL injection weakness in a website, for instance, often allows attackers to run malicious code only as an untrusted user.

- Update: In e-mails received about nine hours after this post went live, Oester wrote: Any user can become root in  5 seconds in my testing, very reliably.

- As to who is being targeted, anyone running Linux on a web facing server is vulnerable. For the past few years, I have been capturing all inbound traffic to my webservers for forensic analysis.

## Nuke plant has been hacked, says Atomic Energy Agency director

- The director of the International Atomic Energy Agency has said he's aware of a successful hack of a nuclear power plant.

- And as if that isn't bad enough, he also knows of an attempt to steal enriched uranium. Yukiya Amano is the agency's director and on Monday visited Germany for meetings, where a Reuters correspondent heard him say an attack on a power plant three or four years ago caused some problems and saw the facility take some precautionary measures.  

- The plant did not need to shut down. The wire service also reports Amano as saying he is aware of an attempt to smuggle a small amount of highly enriched uranium about four years ago that could have been used to build a so-called 'dirty bomb'. Amano's remarks are prima facie terrifying, but perhaps even scarier when one considers our 2013 story revealing Canada's nuclear plants will run code specificallly assembled for PDP-11 minicomputers for at least another 30 years.

- Try finding antivirus software for that!

- Or security auditors who truly understand its innards.

## NSA could put undetectable trapdoors in millions of crypto keys

- This efficiency makes keys with a trapdoored prime ideal for the type of campaign former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden exposed in 2013, which aims to decode vast swaths of the encrypted Internet. "The Snowden documents have raised some serious questions about backdoors in public key cryptography standards," Nadia Heninger, one of the University of Pennsylvania researchers who participated in the project, told Ars.

- From then on, the adversary would have possession of the shared secret that two parties used to generate ephemeral keys during a Diffie-Hellman-encrypted conversation. Remember Dual_EC_DRBG? Such a scenario, assuming it happened, wouldn't be the first time the NSA intentionally weakened standards so it could more easily defeat cryptographic protections.

- Almost from the start, the so-called Dual_EC_DRBG was suspected of containing a deliberately designed weakness that allowed the agency to quickly derive the cryptographic keys that relied on the algorithm for crucial randomness.

- In 2013, some six years later, Snowden-leaked documents all but confirmed the suspicions. RSA Security, at the time owned by the publicly traded corporation EMC, responded by warning customers to stop using Dual_EC_DRBG.

- At the time, Dual_EC_DRBG was the default random number generator in RSA's BSAFE and Data Protection Manager programs. Early this year, Juniper Networks also removed the NSA-developed number generator from its NetScreen line of firewalls after researchers determined it was one of two backdoors allowing attackers to surreptitiously decrypt VPN traffic. In contrast to 1,024-bit keys, keys with a trapdoored prime of 2,048 bits take 16 million times longer to crack, or about 6.4  109 core-years, compared with the 400 core-years it took for the researchers to crack their trapdoored 1,024-bit prime.

## SHA3-256 is quantum-proof, should last BEELLIONS of years, say boffins

- 

- While it's reasonable to assume that a world with real quantum computers will ruin traditional asymmetric encryption, perhaps surprisingly hash functions might survive. That's the conclusion of a group of boffins led by Matthew Amy of Canada's University of Waterloo, in a paper at the International Association of Cryptologic Research.  

- The researchers  which included contributions from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research  looked at attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3 using Grover's algorithm (a quantum algorithm to search "black boxes" - Wikipedia). They reckon both SHA-256 and SHA3-256 need around 2166 logical qubit cycles to crack. Perhaps counter-intuitively, the paper says the problem isn't in the quantum computers, but the classical processors needed to manage them. The paper notes: The main difficulty is that the coherence time of physical qubits is finite.

- Noise in the physical system will eventually corrupt the state of any long computation. Preserving the state of a logical qubit is an active process that requires periodic evaluation of an error detection and correction routine. If the quantum correction is handled by ASICs running at a few million hashes per second (and if Vulture South's spreadsheet is right), Grover's algorithm would need about 1032 years to crack SHA-256 or SHA3-256. That's considerably longer than the mere 14 billion years the universe has existed, although less than the estimated 10100 years until the heat death of the universe.

- Even if you didn't care about the circuit footprint and used a billion-hash-per-second Bitcoin-mining ASIC, the calculation still seems to be in the order of 1029 years.

## The psychological reasons behind risky password practices - Help Net Security

-  Despite high-profile, large-scale data breaches dominating the news cycle  and repeated recommendations from experts to use strong passwords  consumers have yet to adjust their own behavior when it comes to password reuse.  A Lab42 survey, which polled consumers across the United States, Germany, France, New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom, highlights the psychology around why consumers develop poor password habits despite understanding the obvious risk, and suggests that there is a level of cognitive dissonance around our online habits. Your personality will determine why  but not how  you get hacked When it comes to online security, personality type does not inform behavior, but it does reveal how consumers rationalize poor password habits.

- The survey findings show that when attempting to create secure passwords, 47 percent of respondents included family names or initials.

- If passwords are being reused across accounts, cybercriminals who hack a lower-prioritized account can easily gain access to something that is more critical, like a savings or credit card account. Developing poor password habits is a universal problem affecting users of any age, gender or personality type, says Joe Siegrist, VP and GM of LastPass.

- Most users admit to understanding the risks but continue to repeat the behavior despite knowing theyre leaving sensitive information vulnerable to potential hackers.

- In order to establish more effective defenses, we need to better understand why individuals act a certain way online and a system that makes it easier for the average user to better manage their password behavior.

## Ethereum Energy Startup Awarded Blockchain Patent

- A Brooklyn blockchain startup has been awarded a patent by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for its work using the tech to facilitate peer-to-peer energy transfers. LO3 is one of several startups seeking to using a blockchain system to reimagine how energy transfer networks function, looking to distributed networks as a means to cut inefficiencies and costs. Founder Lawrence Orsini and TRC Energy Services project manager Julianna Yun Wei are listed as inventors.

- " Earlier this year, LO3, in partnership with startup ConsenSys, spearheaded a project in New York that saw local residents selling excess power via a blockchain prototype that utilized the ethereum network as a distributed mechanism for selling those units of power via smart contracts. The startup is also involved in a separate initiative, called Brooklyn Microgrid, which is aimed at helping neighborhoods manage energy loads more effectively. Image via Shutterstock

## PayPal patches bone-headed two factor authentication bypass

- Update Paypal has patched a boneheaded two factor authentication breach that allowed attackers to switch off the critical account control in minutes by changing a zero to a one. British MWR InfoSecurity consultant Henry Hoggart (@_mobisek) discovered and quietly reported the flaw to the payment giant.  

- Attackers with username and passwords in hand need only mess with post requests changing securityquestion0 to securityquestion1 for two factor authentication to be bypassed. He says he found the flaw while needing to make a PayPal payment in a reception blackspot. "Recently I was in a hotel needing to make a payment, there was no phone signal so I could not receive my two factor authentication token," Hoggart says. "Luckily for me PayPals two factor authentication took less than five minutes to bypass.

- " Security experts across the internet were mocking PayPal over the simplicity of flaw with some calling it "embarrassing" and asking if the company's security technicians were asleep. Two factor authentication is a modern benchmark for any organisation serious about securing user accounts.

- It introduces tough but not insurmountable barriers that require hackers to steal an external token, often over vulnerable SMS, before usernames and passwords can be abused. "... we know all too well that many users either choose weak passwords or reuse the same password on multiple sites," security man Graham Cluley says. "When built properly, two-factor authentication can make it harder for attackers to break into your account in these situations.

-  Updated to add A Paypal spokesperson sent us the following statement: PayPal takes the security of our customers' data, money and account information extremely seriously.

## Qualcomm Buys NXP In Largest Ever Semiconductor Deal

-  Reuters has reported that Qualcomm will purchase NXP for $38 Billion in the largest semiconductor deal ever. This deal was rumored last month in a deal worth about $30 Billion.

- Qualcomms name should be familiar to all Hackaday readers  they have an immense portfolio of mobile processors, automotive chips, and a ton of connectivity solutions for WiFi, Bluetooth, and every other bit of the EM spectrum.

- NXP should also be familiar for their hundreds of ARM devices, automotive devices, and Freescales entire portfolio. The deal for $38 Billion is just a bit larger than the previous largest semiconductor deal, Avagos purchase of Broadcom for $37 Billion. This latest acquisition has followed acquisitions of ARM Holdings by Japans Softbank, On and Fairchild, Avago and Broadcom, NXP and Freescale, Microchip and Atmel, Intel and Altera, and a few dozen were forgetting right now.

- The good news is this immense industry consolidation wont result in a single gigantic chip maker; there will probably be two or three gigantic chip companies in the future.

- If I may dredge up an observation from a Mergers and Acquisition post from this summer, this trend didnt go well for Hughes, Fairchild, Convair, Douglas, McDonnell Douglas, North American, Grumman, Northrop, Northrop Grumman, Bell, Cessna, Schweizer or Sikorsky.

## New MacBook Pros Max Out At 16GB RAM Due To Battery Life Concerns

- The reason why the MacBook Pros continue to max out at 16GB RAM is due to battery life concerns, according to marketing chief Phil Schiller.

- MacRumors reader David emailed Apple to get an explanation:  Question from David: "The lack of a 32GB BTO option for the new MBPs raised some eyebrows and caused some concerns (me included).

- I.e. memory paging on a 16GB system is so fast that 32GB is not a significant improvement?"

- I hope you check out this new generation MacBook Pro, it really is an incredible system."

-  For the 2016 MacBook Pro, Apple was able to reach "all-day battery life," which equates to 10 hours of wireless web use or iTunes movie playback.

## Apple Sucks Now, Heres A ThinkPad Buyers Guide

- Theyve been fantastic developers machines, and the MacBook Pro is the de facto standard laptop issued to all developers, all hackathon attendees, and arguably, anyone who does real work with a computer. This week, Apple unveiled the latest MacBook Pro and provided more evidence Steve Jobs actually knew what he was doing.

- The next model up costs $1800, ditches the Escape key for a dedicated emoji bar, and includes four Thunderbolt 3 ports. In the past, I have defended people who choose MacBooks as their laptop of choice.

- With the X220, youll have a slightly more modern ThinkPad, but still one that can handle basic tasks, development, and pretty much everything that isnt video, gaming, or photo editing.

- That said, our experience in planning so many meetups, attending so many hackathons, and chilling out at so many conferences gives us a unique insight into laptop buying trends.

- Were not going to become the next Uber Consumer Blog wasting your time with product announcements. However, Apples latest MacBook announcement missed the mark and you wont find many people saying otherwise.

## How Google's Project Zero made Apple refactor its kernel

- When Apple shipped its security bug-fixes earlier this week, one patch mostly passed under the radar. Ian Beer of Google Project Zero, who found a deep-down vulnerability in the XNU kernel, first reported it to Apple in February this year, and it took until now to clean it up properly.  

- It took eight months, apparently, because of a basic architectural feature of the kernel: calling target functions directly instead of via the MIG IPC (Mach interface generator inter process communication) layer is fast, but theres no central point where access to a resource can be cut off. In this post, task_t considered harmful, Beer describes (in gloriously geek-out detail) a discovery that needed a large refactor in MacOS 10.12.1 / iOS 10.1 to fix. The too-long-didn't-read version is that the bugs offered at least two exploit types: privilege escalation, and sandbox escape. How come?

- Because when a new program  of the type SUID binary  launches, old tasks and thread ports are invalidated, but the essence of the bug is in this Chromium Project Zero bug report: When a suid binary is executed it's true that the task's old task and thread ports get invalidated, however, the task struct itself stays the same.

- This means that any pointers to that task struct now point to the task struct of an euid 0 process. Back to Beer's more readable post: by creating a dangling task_t, an exploit can do things like writing to one IOKit process's buffer from another process  and, as he demonstrates, that means one process can write to a more privileged process. Since this bug also allows us to gain any entitlements we want as well as root its easy to use it to defeat kernel code signing on OS X and load an unsigned kernel extension.

- See the exploit for CVE-2016-1757 for one way to do this, explained Beer. Every task_t pointer is a potential security bug, Beer added, because theres no locking mechanism to let you assert that the privileges of a task struct havent changed since you got access to it and just because kernel code got access to a task struct at one time doesnt mean it should have access later. Apple went through two rounds of mitigations before this week's fix, because, Beer notes, This isn't an easy bug class to fix ... There are task_t pointers everywhere.

## Pirate Party Gains Seats In Iceland's Election

- It is in joint second place with the Left-Greens -- with 10 seats each

- Iceland's hacker-led, upstart Pirate Party failed to make the nation's powerful Independence Party walk the plank after all. The Pirate Party -- led by a former WikiLeaks collaborator -- rode the populist movement sweeping Europe to make big gains in Saturday's election, but returns on Sunday gave the largest bloc of seats to the center-right Independence Party...

- Pirate Party co-founder Birgitta Jonsdottir, who became involved with WikiLeaks in 2010 after its leader Julian Assange visited Iceland

## Payback? Russia Gets Hacked, Revealing Putin Aide's Secrets

- Ukrainian activists have compromised 2,337 messages in the Microsoft Outlook accounts of two assistants to a top aide of Vladimir Putin.

- An anonymous Slashdot reader quotes NBC News: A Ukrainian group calling itself Cyber Hunta has released more than a gigabyte of emails and other material from the office of one of Vladimir Putin's top aides, Vladislav Surkov, that show Russia's fingerprints all over the separatist movement in Ukraine.

- While the Kremlin has denied the relationship between Moscow and the separatists, the emails show in great detail how Russia controlled virtually every detail of the separatist effort in the Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine, which has torn the country apart and led to a Russian takeover of Crimea...   "This is a serious hack," said Maks Czuperski, head of the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, which has searched through the email dump and placed selected emails online.

- It was only a question of time that some of the anonymous guys like Cyber Hunta would come to strike them back."

-   A senior U.S. intelligence official told NBC News that the U.S. "had no role" in the breach -- but when asked if the material was authentic, replied there was "nothing to indicate otherwise.

## The Plot Thickens As DAO Attacker Trades Stolen Funds for Bitcoin

-  The DAO hacker is one step closer to turning a real-world profit. The saga that started in June with a high-profile hack on ethereum's most notable project, took another turn on Wednesday when nearly $100,000 worth of digital currency associated with the incident was converted into bitcoin. Given the impact of the hack on the ethereum ecosystem (it sparked weeks of debate and led to a schism among the technology's supporters), the whereabouts of the funds have long been a matter of public interest.

- Funds first began moving in August and were reported to be in transit again in September. Now, analysis from Bok Consulting founder Bok Khoo indicates that a portion of the funds have reached at least one major exchange. Khoo, who has been tracking the theft for months, first determined that the hacker split the funds into 2,333 ETC chunks on Wednesday in an attempt to sidestep restrictions imposed by digital currency exchange ShapeShift.

- " Ecosystem impact While the news is certainly a positive for the DAO attacker, the incident isn't likely to be relevant for blockchain development more broadly. Ethereum's developers continue to assert that they support the move to edit the ethereum blockchain to return funds to DAO users. At Money2020 this week, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin argued that he doesn't believe the decision for developers to intervene affects the "immutability" of the ethereum ledger (as suggested by ethereum classic). "Principles have to serve a social purpose," he said. However, Buterin said that he continues to evaluate the decision, and that he now believes there needs to be "more supporting infrastructure" so that developers don't need to edit the blockchain when such an incident occurs. Meanwhile, ethereum classic's supporters continue to believe their users should have confidence in any and all transactions that are valid on the ledger. Ethereum classic supporter Avtar Sehra wrote on Twitter: "The DAO attacker funds may be on the move, but it's not like they can disappear  this is ETC not Accenture's 'editable blockchain.

## Iceland election: Pirate Party triples seats

- But their centre-left coalition fell short of a majority to form a government.The governing Progressive Party lost more than half of its seats in the poll triggered by the resignation of Prime Minister Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson.Its junior partner, the Independence Party, has come top with 21 seats.

-  Current Prime Minister Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson resigned on Sunday. 

- The anti-establishment Pirate Party, which was founded in 2012, had said it could be looking to form a coalition with three left-wing and centrist parties.The Independence Party and the Pirates have ruled out working together, although correspondents say this could change as negotiations take place in the coming days.Pirate Party founder and MP Birgitta Jonsdottir said she was "very satisfied" with the result."Our internal predictions showed 10 to 15%, so this is at the top of the range.

- We knew that we would never get 30%," Ms Jonsdottir told Reuters news agency.The party won support from many in the wake of Iceland's 2008 financial crisis and the Panama Papers' revelations earlier this year.It calls for more political transparency and accountability, free health care, closing tax loopholes and more protection of citizens' data. 

- Opponents, however, say the Pirate Party's lack of political experience could scare off investors and destabilise Iceland's recovering economy.

## Ansible 2.2 Network Updates

- At the time, this was a fairly big departure from the more traditional roots where Ansible has focused on in the systems and application development worlds.

- In addition, the individual network operating system config modules implement specific functionality on a per platform basis. One of the key features added in Ansible 2.2 is the ability for config modules to now provide an argument for saving the current ephemeral configuration to nonvolatile storage for platforms that require it.

- Finally, one of the biggest changes implemented in the config modules is the introduction of using automated rollbacks where available (per platform).

- While there are some deviations based on how information is presented and gleaned from the underlying operating systems, efforts have been made to standardize fact collection.

- Over the course of the last year, we, collectively as an Ansible community, have established a foundation for being able to address integration of configuration automation across IT disciplines.

## All it takes to steal your face is a special pair of glasses

- But new research from Carnegie Mellon University shows that facial recognition software is far from secure. In a paper (pdf) presented at a security conference on Oct. 28, researchers showed they could trick AI facial recognition systems into misidentifying facesmaking someone caught on camera appear to be someone else, or even unrecognizable as human.

- With a special pair of eyeglass frames, the team forced commercial-grade facial recognition software into identifying the wrong person with up to 100% success rates.

- Researchers had the same success tricking software touted by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba for use in their smile-to-pay feature. Modern facial recognition software relies on deep neural networks, a flavor of artificial intelligence that learns patterns from thousands and millions of pieces of information.

- However, this was tested digitallythe researchers edited the glasses onto a picture, so in the real world the success rate could be less. The CMU work builds on previous research by Google, OpenAI, and Pennsylvania State University that has found systematic flaws with the way deep neural networks are trained.

- By exploiting these vulnerabilities with purposefully malicious data called adversarial examples, like the image printed on the glasses in this CMU work, researchers have consistently been able to force AI to make decisions it wouldnt otherwise make. In the lab, this means a 40-year-old white female researcher passing as John Malkovich, but their success could also be achieved by someone trying to break into a building or steal files from a computer.

- And while a patch is on the way for the vulnerability, he encouraged customers to upgrade to Windows 10 for protection from further advanced threats. In an advisory, Myerson wrote: Recently, the activity group that Microsoft Threat Intelligence calls STRONTIUM conducted a low-volume spear-phishing campaign.

- "Along these lines, patches for all versions of Windows are now being tested by many industry participants, and we plan to release them publicly on the next Update Tuesday, Nov 8.

- "Google's decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk.

## New leak may show if you were hacked by the NSA

- Shadow Brokersthe name used by a person or group that created seismic waves in August when it published some of the National Security Agency's most elite hacking toolsis back with a new leak that the group says reveals hundreds of organizations targeted by the NSA over more than a decade. "TheShadowBrokers is having special trick or treat for Amerikanskis tonight," said the Monday morning post, which was signed by the same encryption key used in the August posts.

- " Monday's leak came as former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin III remains in federal custody on charges that he hoarded an astounding 50 terabytes of data in his suburban Maryland home.

- Vitali Kremez, a senior intelligence analyst at security firm Flashpoint, also provides useful analysis here. The dump also includes various other pieces of data.

- Linux and FreeBSD are also shown. "If this data is believed then it may contain a list of computers which were targeted during this time period," the analysis provided by Hacker House, a firm that offers various security services, stated.

- Typically, redirectors are used to surreptitiously direct someone from one domain to another. Other purported NSA tools discussed in Monday's dump have names including DEWDROP, INCISION, JACKLADDER, ORANGUTAN, PATCHICILLIN, RETICULUM, SIDETRACK, AND STOCSURGEON.

## Icelandic women walk off the job 14% early to protest 14% pay-gap

-  On October 25, thousands of Icelandic women went home at 2:38PM, after 86% of their work-days had passed, to protest the fact that they only earn 86% of their male counterparts' wages.

-  They turned out for a mass demonstration that echoed the 1975 protests over pay equity, which saw over 90% of the country's women take to the street.

- And in 2000, Icelands government passed a landmark parental leave legislation that many credit with helping women to return to work, and their former hours, more quickly after childbirth.

-  Pussy Riots video for Straight Outta Vagina frames the poppy, danceable song with visuals calculated to enrage the Kremlin, with LAs Ace Hotel standing in for church where various genderbent dancers receive communion while singing the praises of vaginas.

## How to block the ultrasonic signals you didnt know were tracking you

- And though you probably have no idea that dog whistle marketing is going on, researchers are already offering ways to protect yourself. The technology, called ultrasonic cross-device tracking, embeds high-frequency tones that are inaudible to humans in advertisements, web pages, and even physical locations like retail stores.

- These ultrasound beacons emit their audio sequences with speakers, and almost any device microphonelike those accessed by an app on a smartphone or tabletcan detect the signal and start to put together a picture of what ads youve seen, what sites youve perused, and even where youve been.

- Now that youre sufficiently concerned, the good news is that at the Black Hat Europe security conference on Thursday, a group based at University of California, Santa Barbara will present an Android patch and a Chrome extension that give consumers more control over the transmission and receipt of ultrasonic pitches on their devices. Beyond the abstract creep factor of ultrasonic tracking, the larger worry about the technology is that it requires giving an app the ability to listen to everything around you, says Vasilios Mavroudis, a privacy and security researcher at University College London who worked on the research being presented at Black Hat.

- The researchers plan to post their patch and their extension available for download after their Black Hat presentation. Ultrasonic tracking has been evolving for the last couple of years, and it is relatively easy to deploy since it relies on basic speakers and microphones instead of specialized equipment.

- But the beacons need to complete their transmissions in the time it takes someone to briefly check a website or pass a store, and its difficult to fit an authentication process into those few seconds.

## Microsoft Doubles Down on Ethereum With New Blockchain Product - CoinDesk

- The product has been designed so that groups of companies can deploy a private ethereum network with a single click. Released privately to Github earlier this month, the streamlined set-up process and new features are part of a larger push by Microsoft toward blockchain that has to date focused mostly on its Azure cloud product as well as the enterprise business market. Microsoft Azure's principal blockchain architect, Marley Gray, told CoinDesk: "We're focused on building a sandbox for developers, working with customers and partners to develop and test combinations of technologies, and ultimately, helping collections of customers select the right tools that solve specific business problems.

- " In addition to the one-click deployment, the update includes five new tools the project's manager said are specifically designed to let consortia networks develop more complex smart contracts for any number of self-executing business applications. Microsoft senior program manager Christine Avanessians highlighted one change that lets groups spin up consortia with as few as three nodes run from a single IP address. While the service still enables geographically dispersed nodes via the cloud integration, the changes could make it easier for companies to test the efficiencies potentially created from an alternative set up. Perhaps most importantly though, based on customer feedback on an earlier version, Avanessians said the Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network automatically creates user private keys to satisfy security requirements. Avanessians told CoinDesk: "You no longer need to generate and provide a private key.

- But startups are trying their hand at winning enterprise business as well. Deloitte spin-off Nuco, for example, entered the market earlier this year specifically to offer services for building blockchain consortia. In May, Microsoft Azure's chief technical officer told CoinDesk the company's overall goal for its own version of the service is to help global industries build blockchain consortia. So far, most blockchain consortia have come from the financial sector, but Microsoft believes future industries will follow suit. Already, blockchain consortia are springing up around the world, with efforts in China, Japan and Russia all announced in the last few months. Dollar bills While financial numbers on the burgeoning industry are tough to come by, one indicator of the revenue at stake can be found in Microsofts BaaS sandbox, which boasts products from a wide range of blockchain startups. Monthly fees on the platform start with a base amount per virtual machine as low as about $14 and as high as about $90.

- The price increases based on the number of IP addresses ($2.98 per month) and the number of transactions conducted ($0.0036 per unit). Support options range from a free introductory offer up to $1,000 per month for professional grade support. Initially, the improved Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network is available as part of a free trial to anyone.
