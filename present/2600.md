## Vulnerability in Blackphone Allows Complete Takeover

-   Developed by SGP Technologies, a wholly owned subsidiary of SilentCircle, the Blackphone provides users control over app permissions, such as the bundled Silent Phone and Silent Text services that anonymise and encrypt communications so no one can eavesdrop on voice, video and text calls.

-   As part of reverse engineering exercise to prepare for a Red Naga training session we discovered this socket was left open and accessible on the Blackphone (BP1)   shell@blackphone:/dev/socket $ ls -l at_pal srw-rw-rw- radio    system            2015-07-31 17:51 at_pal   There is almost no mention of this socket anywhere on the internet  except for file_contexts used by SELinux on Android.

- At the same time, we pulled all the files from the device and started grepping for AT style codes.

- And finally, virtually all vulnerabilities require some form of malware in order to be remotely exploited.

- Monitoring processes on a device can provide an important layer of detection and response when apparently legitimate requests to perform system functions originate from anomalous sources.

## CitiBank Trader Created Safe Exchange To Avoid the CIAs Spying In China And USA

- CoinTelegraph: Former CitiBank shares trader is solving a problem, how to avoid the CIAs spying in China and USA to keep privacy and secrets in business.

- With privacy in users hands first, and instantaneous transfer of cryptographic payloads (coins) it reduce the threat layer that people are exposed to.

- DD: Certainly, Safe Exchange is a digital contract marketplace that lets people create a cryptographic version of an underlying thing and be able to transfer it by message or through sale.

- I think of 1 trillion dollars asset ATT - with solutions like bitcoin it introduced that people will run their computer at home and maintain the network.

- People have the right to their privacy and especially when conducting their trade and business unless they choose disclosure like in the case of nonprofits and governments but for everyone else they deserve that level of security.

## Security Losses from Obsolete and Truncated Transcript Hashes

-   Technical Paper: Transcript Collision Attacks: Breaking Authentication in TLS, IKE, and SSH, Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent, Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2016) 

- Introduction  In response to recent high-profile attacks that exploit hash function collisions, software vendors have started to phase out the use of MD5 and SHA1 in third-party digital signature applications such as X.509 certificates.

-  We identify a new class of transcript collision attacks on popular cryptographic protocols such as TLS, IKE, and SSH, that significantly reduce their expected security.

- For example, MD5 signatures have been known to be cryptographically broken since at least 2005, but they continue to be used in TLS today, when collision attacks have become significantly more practical, even on standard desktop workstations.

- Consequently applications that use this version are vulnerable, including those that rely on the default system OpenSSL on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, Debian Wheezy, Android 4.4.2 and 5.0.0, and Akamai GHost servers.

## Trustwave failed to spot casino hackers right under its nose  lawsuit

- IT security biz Trustwave is being sued by a Las Vegas casino operator for allegedly bungling a hacking investigation.

- Trustwave denies any wrongdoing. The outcome of the lawsuit could have staggering consequences for infosec outfits hired to analyze and cleanup computer network intrusions, in terms of potential liabilities and breaches of contract.  

- Allegedly, though, hackers broke into Affinity's systems again while Trustwave was investigating, and this second infiltration was not detected. Affinity  which runs five casinos in Nevada, and six elsewhere in the US  claimed in its lawsuit paperwork [PDF]:  Hiring a firm with the proper data breach response expertise, such as Trustwave held itself out to be, was of paramount importance for Affinity Gaming, because, while Affinity takes seriously its data security obligations, and has implemented commercially reasonable and appropriate measures to protect its and its customers data, Affinity is not an IT security firm and lacks the level of expertise and know-how in the technical aspects of data security that a firm like Trustwave purports to possess.

- On April 16, 2014, in the course of performing such a test, Ernst  Young identified suspicious activity, including ongoing activity from a malware program named Framepkg.exe, which Trustwave had found, but apparently had not contained or sought to remediate, during its investigation in 2013.  Affinity next hired security biz Mandiant, which concluded that "Trustwaves prior work was woefully inadequate," according to the lawsuit's paperwork.

- Mandiant is a rival of Trustwave. "We dispute and disagree with the allegations in the lawsuit and we will defend ourselves vigorously in court," Trustwave told the Financial Times on Friday.

[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/16/trustwave_sued_by_casino/](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/16/trustwave_sued_by_casino/)

## Security firm sued for filing woefully inadequate forensics report

- A Las Vegas-based casino operator has sued security firm Trustwave for conducting an allegedly "woefully inadequate" forensics investigation that missed key details of a network breach and allowed credit card thieves to maintain their foothold during the course of the two-and-a-half-month investigation. In a legal complaint filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Affinity Gaming said it hired Trustwave in October 2013 to investigate and contain a network breach that allowed attackers to obtain customers' credit card data.

- More than a year later after Affinity was hit by a second credit card breach, the casino operator allegedly learned from Trustwave competitor Mandiant that the malware had never been fully removed. According to the December, 2015 complaint: Mandiants forthright and thorough investigation concluded that Trustwaves representations were untrue, and Trustwaves prior work was woefully inadequate.

- Trustwave allegedly failed to detect several pieces of malware infecting network servers or that the breach was ultimately the result of people who were able to access Affinity's virtual private network and install backdoor software. "Mandiants report also concluded that the various recommendations Trustwave had presented to improve Affinity Gamings data security were pointless," the complaint alleged.

- " The complaint provides a rare glimpse inside the confidential world of security incident response and underscores the consequences when investigations don't have the results customers expect.

- As a result of the follow-on breaches, Affinity was required to obtain the second PCI forensics report from Mandiant and to pay additional assessments so banks could reissue credit cards.

## LastPass in 2FA lock down after 'fessing up to phishing attack

- Shmoocon Cloud castle for passwords LastPass has introduced mandatory sign in requirements for all new devices after security researcher Sean Cassidy dropped code allowing criminals to plunder vaults with mirror-perfect phishing attacks. As of today, users who set two factor authentication will need to hop to their registered email accounts to approve the device they are using to sign into LastPass.  

- It was previously a requirement for daredevils not using two factor. The change is a rapid move to quell online anarchy in the wake of research finding most users would likely be hosed in phishing attacks that request users enter their details including two factor authentication credentials into very legitimate-looking alerts. Until hours ago it meant criminals could very quickly spin up pre-fab phishing pages or simply direct users to cross-site scripting -vulnerable legitimate sites . Criminals could make their own phishing pages targeting the new LastPass version 4 "in less than a day", Cassidy says. "I am publishing this [phishing] tool so that companies can pen-test themselves to make an informed decision about this attack and respond appropriately.

- " Attackers could block warning prompts that LastPass would normally throw in the event their vault master password is entered anywhere but the official website. 

- LostPass in Firefox: Spot the difference.  LastPass acknowledged the 'LostPass' attack in December and considered a less significant phishing issue. Cassidy (@sean_a_cassidy) , chief technology wonk of Seattle-based security outfit Praesidio, published code to Github after giving a talk at the ShmooCon conference in Washington. He explains how attackers can create a banner -- or viewport -- to fool users into entering their credentials, and log victims out of their accounts using a known cross-site request forgery flaw open to any website. "Unlike most phishing attacks, users won't be on their guard because this isn't supposed to be a secure website," Cassidy says. "If they have LastPass installed, show the login expired notification and log the user out of LastPass [which] will make it appear to the user that they are truly logged out. "Once the victim clicks on the fake banner, direct them to an attacker-controlled login page that looks identical to the LastPass one.

- " Attackers who get into accounts can add themselves as an emergency contact to ensure persistence, he says. LastPass said email verification will all but neuter the attacks unless email accounts are also compromised. "The verification process significantly reduces the threat of this phishing attack," the company says in a post to which it is directing concerned social media users. "The attacker would need to gain access to the users email account as well, which could also be mitigated by two-factor authentication for their email account."

## FireEye buys iSight Partners for $200M

- 

- Security giant FireEye has bought threat company iSight Partners for US$200 million, marking a notable consolidation in the sector. It brings the threat intel company, notable for its research into sophisticated and nation-state attacks, into the fold of the network security mammoth.  

- FireEye will pay another $75 million in cash and stock should second quarter 2018 sales targets be met under the deal closed 14 January. ISight chief executive officer John Watters said last August that he hoped to win a US$1 billion valuation in a 2016 initial public offering. FireEye says iSIGHT customers will still have access to their iSIGHT products while it will add intelligence subscription models for specific verticals, similar to that offered with Visa.

- The company will immediately feed threat intelligence into its ecosystem refreshing every hour. iSIGHT employs some 350 staff of which more than 250 are in the threat intelligence game, and has invested $100 million over eight years to build its capabilities.

- It is unknown if redundancies or staff changes are planned. FireEye chief executive officer David DeWalt says people are mistaken if they consider threat intelligence a collection of virus definitions in a database. "Forward-looking security organisations - from governments to the private sector - know threat intelligence is the key to establishing a robust security posture tuned for the threats targeting each organisation," DeWalt said in a statement. "As the cyber operations become integrated with physical, geopolitical and competitive conflict, an intelligence-led approach to security will be key in detecting the most sophisticated threats and responding to them quickly and effectively."

## Hackers and Heroes: Rise of the CCC and Hackerspaces

-  From its roots in phone phreaking to the crackdowns and legal precedents that drove hacking mostly underground (or into business), hacker culture in the United States has seen a lot over the last three decades.

- Only BTX was run by the government phone monopoly, and relatively costly. The story goes that a buffer overflow was discovered by CCC founders Wau Holland and Steffen Wernery that would spit out unencoded data, among them passwords in cleartext.

- In the early years of HacDC, we had a great time with high-altitude ballooning, for instance, because it got to connect up our hardware folks with the ham radio people and even the web-development types who cobbled together a nice real-time mapping solution.

- But at the same time, HacDC also put out Project Byzantium, an easy-to-configure ad-hoc wireless mesh networking solution. So as much as I love the way that the US hackerspaces have sprouted up out of over the last decade, and as much as each individual space that Ive visited has been neat and interesting in its own right, I have to say that theres something missing in the USA, and thats a larger organization and purpose.

- You could do worse than start with the the Hacker ethic, which non-coincidentally came up out of the early days of MITs shared computer resources, but is the unifying basis in the German CCC:  Access to computersand anything which might teach you something about the way the world worksshould be unlimited and total.

## Shmoocon 2016: Reverse Engineering Cheap Chinese Radio Firmware

-  Every once in a great while, a piece of radio gear catches the attention of a prolific hardware guru and is reverse engineered.

- Getting around the RDP is the very definition of a jailbreak, and thanks to a few forgetful or lazy Chinese engineers, it is most certainly possible. The STM32 in the radio implements a USB Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU), probably because of some example code from ST.

- Dumping the memory from the standard DFU protocol just repeated the same binary string, but with a little bit of coaxing and investigating the terrible Windows-only official client application, [Travis] was able to find non-standard DFU commands, write a custom DFU client, and read and write the codeplug, an SPI Flash chip that stores radio settings, frequencies, and talk groups. Further efforts to dump all the firmware on the radio were a success, and with that began the actual reverse engineering of the radio.

- This OS is very well documented, with slightly more effort new functions and patches can be written. In Digital Mobile Radio, audio is sent through either a public talk group or a private contact.

- [Travis] is looking for people who can add support for P25, D-Star, System Fusion, a proper scanner, or the ability to send and receive DMR frames over USB.

## MITMf  Man-In-The-Middle Attack Framework

- MITMf is a Man-In-The-Middle Attack Framework which aims to to provide a one-stop-shop for Man-In-The-Middle and network attacks while updating and improving existing attacks and techniques.  Originally built to address the significant shortcomings of other tools (e.g Ettercap, Mallory), its been almost completely re-written from scratch to provide a modular and easily extendible framework that anyone can use to implement their own MITM attack. Features  The framework contains a built-in SMB, HTTP and DNS server that can be controlled and used by the various plugins, it also contains a modified version of the SSLStrip proxy that allows for HTTP modification and a partial HSTS bypass. As of version 0.9.8, MITMf supports active packet filtering and manipulation (basically what etterfilters did, only better), allowing users to modify any type of traffic or protocol. The configuration file can be edited on-the-fly while MITMf is running, the changes will be passed down through the framework: this allows you to tweak settings of plugins and servers while performing an attack. MITMf will capture FTP, IRC, POP, IMAP, Telnet, SMTP, SNMP (community strings), NTLMv1/v2 (all supported protocols like HTTP, SMB, LDAP etc.)

- and Kerberos credentials by using Net-Creds, which is run on startup. Responder integration allows for LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoning and WPAD rogue server support.  Available Plugins  HTA Drive-By : Injects a fake update notification and prompts clients to download an HTA application SMBTrap : Exploits the SMB Trap vulnerability on connected clients ScreenShotter : Uses HTML5 Canvas to render an accurate screenshot of a clients browser Responder : LLMNR, NBT-NS, WPAD and MDNS poisoner SSLstrip+ : Partially bypass HSTS Spoof : Redirect traffic using ARP, ICMP, DHCP or DNS spoofing BeEFAutorun : Autoruns BeEF modules based on a clients OS or browser type AppCachePoison : Performs HTML5 App-Cache poisoning attacks Ferret-NG : Transperently hijacks client sessions BrowserProfiler : Attempts to enumerate all browser plugins of connected clients FilePwn : Backdoor executables sent over HTTP using the Backdoor Factory and BDFProxy Inject : Inject arbitrary content into HTML content BrowserSniper : Performs drive-by attacks on clients with out-of-date browser plugins JSkeylogger : Injects a Javascript keylogger into a clients webpages Replace : Replace arbitrary content in HTML content SMBAuth : Evoke SMB challenge-response authentication attempts Upsidedownternet : Flips images 180 degrees  You can download MITMf here: mitmf-v0.9.8.zip Or read more here.

## Microsoft silenty adds Amazon root certificates to its CTL

- This conveniently occurs just in time for Amazon's Certificate Services go-live.

- But what should have been a fairly ordinary update is raising a few red flags.

-  Amazon is reported to have some close ties to spy agencies. The new roots have not been announced by Microsoft.

- Their Program Participants page is oddly silent about the changes.

- Additionally, it's interesting that Starfield (another root acquired by Amazon last year) does not appear in there either.

## Server Security OSSEC Integrates Slack and PagerDuty

-  We leverage OSSEC extensively to help monitor and protect our servers.

- If you are not familiar with OSSEC, it is an open source Intrusion Detection System (HIDS); it has a powerful correlation and analysis engine that integrates log analysis, file integrity monitoring, centralized policy enforcement, rootkit detection, real-time alerting, and active response. It provides complete coverage if you are looking for an endpoint (server) security solution. If you have not used OSSEC before, I recommend reading my guide to get started: http://dcid.me/texts/my-ossec-setup-manual.html Note that it requires root access to your servers and is meant for network and server administrators with Linux skills. Integrating OSSEC with Slack and PagerDuty One of the new features that we open sourced and pushed to OSSEC is an integrator daemon that we have been using internally to connect OSSEC to external APIs and alerting tools.

- The first two APIs we officially added were for Slack and PagerDuty. To get started, you have to download OSSEC from our fork, either from the development branch or from the our stable branch: After you install (or update) OSSEC, you need to enable the integrator daemon with the following command: # /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control enable integrator If the right version of OSSEC is installed, no errors will be generated and you are ready to configure it. Integrating with Slack Slack is taking the world by storm and many companies are using it for internal communication.

- Most people are always connected to it, making it more practical to use for real-time alerts than to depend solely on email. Additionally, Slack integration is very easy to configure.

- First, you have to go to Slack and enable a new integration under Settings  Custom Integrations  Incoming Webhooks.  You then choose a channel and a new hook will be created in the format of: https://hooks.slack.com/services/RANDOMSTRING/RANDOMSTRING.

- But if your password gets stolen, you can change it to a new one; what happens when your fingerprint gets copied?Thats no longer an abstract fear: a speaker at the Chaos Communication Congress, an annual meeting of hackers in Germany, demonstrated his method for faking fingerprints using only a few high-definition photographs of his target, German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen.Jan Krissler, known in hacker circles as Starbug, used commercial software called VeriFinger and several close-range photos of von der Leyen, including one gleaned from a press release issued by her own office and another he took himself from three meters away, to reverse-engineer the fingerprint. Jan Krissler, also known as Starbug in hacker circles, considers his password safer than his fingerprints

- Using a smudge on the screen of an iPhone, he printed a dummy finger using wood glue and sprayable graphene, which successfully unlocked a phone registered to someone elses thumb.For that hack, he had to have physical access to the phone he stole the fingerprint from, in order to get a high-resolution scan of the print.

- His latest demonstration suggests that it may be possible to unlock a phone using a fingerprint stolen without ever touching a person or their property  although actually getting hold of the phone is still needed for the last stage, of actually unlocking it.The increasing number of successful attacks against biometric identification has led to some security researchers advising that people change the way they think about security measures such as fingerprints and photo ID.

- Rather than treating them as a replacement for passwords, they should instead be used as a second factor of authentication, or even as something similar to a username: a publicly known piece of information which must be linked to a password before a user can log in.As the ACLUs Jay Stanley told The Washington Post, Biometrics are not secrets...

- Ideally, theyre unique to each individual, but thats not the same thing as being a secret.And Starbug agrees, telling Zeit in 2013 that I consider my password safer than my fingerprint... My password is in my head, and if Im careful when typing, I remain the only one who knows it.By arrangement with the GuardianPublished in Dawn, January 1st, 2015

## The Twelve Days of Crisis  A Retrospective on Linodes Holiday DDoS Attacks

- Over the twelve days between December 25th and January 5th, Linode saw more than a hundred denial-of-service attacks against every major part of our infrastructure, some severely disrupting service for hundreds of thousands of Linode customers.

- Layer 7 (400 Bad Request) attacks toward our public-facing websites

- Volumetric attacks toward our websites, authoritative nameservers, and other public services

- Volumetric attacks toward Linode network infrastructure

- Volumetric attacks toward our colocation providers network infrastructure

- hese attacks almost never affect the wider Linode network because of a tool we use to protect ourselves called remote-triggered blackholing

- blackholing is a blunt but crucial weapon in our arsenal

- In hindsight, we believe the longer outages could have been avoided if we had not been relying on our colocation partners for IP transit.

- Lesson three: let customers know whats happening

## An XSS on Facebook via PNGs  Wonky Content Types

- I started searching for ideas and came across this great blog post: Encoding Web Shells in PNG IDAT chunks.

- The post describes encoding data into the IDAT chunk, which ensures itll stay there even after the modifications Facebooks image uploader makes.

- The author kindly provides a proof-of-concept image, which worked perfectly (the PHP shell obviously wont execute, but it demonstrates that the data survived uploading).

- Now, I could have submitted the bug there and then - weve got proof that images can be served with a content type of text/html, and angle brackets arent encoded (which means we can certainly inject HTML).

- As mentioned in post, the first step is to craft a string, that when compressed using DEFLATE, produces the desired output.

## VirusTotal adds support for analyzing EFI firmware files

- These executables are extracted and submitted individually to VirusTotal, such that the user can eventually see a report for each one of them and perhaps get a notion of whether there is something fishy in their BIOS image.

- They are two different BIOS updates for Lenovo S21e laptop systems, the second one removes what was identified as factory-installed malware, taking a closer look at both reports you will notice that the first image contains a NovoSecEngine2 Windows executable in charge of deploying further artifacts onto the target system.

- Obviously, this has its limitations, the system could be compromised in such a manner that the dumpers are deceived, you should understand that the ultimate ground truth is physically attaching to the chip and electronically dumping the flash memory.

- If you are on a Mac, DarwinDumper will allow you to easily strip sensitive information by checking the "Make dumps private" option.

- Premium users of VirusTotal Intelligence and VirusTotal Private Mass API will soon be able to read a follow-up article in Intelligence's blog in order to understand how all of this information is now indexed and searchable, allowing you to track down advanced actors making use of BIOS badness in order to persist in their targets' systems.         We would like to specially thank Teddy Reed, developer of the UEFI firmware python parser, he has been instrumental in helping us overcome our ignorance about BIOS, UEFI, and its ecosystem.

## WiFi Alliance Introduces 802.11ah

- For the last decade or so, wireless networking has been entirely about short range, high speed communications.

- This week the WiFi alliance introduced IEEE 802.11ah into the WiFi spec

- Its called WiFi HaLow (pronounced like angels headwear

- unlike other versions of 802.11, WiFi HaLow uses low frequencies for low bandwidth but a much larger range.

- WiFi HaLow uses the 900 MHz ISM band to communicate, divided into 26 channels. The bandwidth is low  a mere 100 kbps, but the range is huge: one kilometer, or about four times the approximate range of 802.11n.

## The Dark Arts: Meet the LulzSec Hackers

-  Its difficult to say if [Aaron Barr], then CEO of software security company HBGary Federal, was in his right mind when he targeted the notorious hacking group known as Anonymous.

- They replaced the HBGary Federal homepage with this declaration  with a link to a torrent file containing some 50,000 emails resting ominously at the bottom.

- The hacked HBGary homepage linked above was [Topiarys] work. Lest we leave you with the impression that [Topiary] was not a hacker, he learned a great deal of technical skills during his involvement with Anonymous and later Lulzsec.

- [Pwnsauce], another Lulzsec member whom we will not cover due to lack of information, believed he was at least 30 years old. It was [Tflow] who first shed light on [Aaron Barrs] plans to dox the Anonymous leaders.

- It was [Tflow] who wrote an advanced piece of code that allowed the citizens of Tunisia to get past their governments ISP restrictions during the Arab Spring and post on social media.

## Israels electric grid hit by severe hack attack

- Israel's Electricity Authority experienced a serious hack attack that officials are still working to repel, the country's energy minister said Tuesday. "The virus was already identified and the right software was already prepared to neutralize it," Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz told attendees of a computer security conference in Tel Aviv, according to this article published Tuesday by The Times of Israel.

- Steinitz said it was one of the biggest computer-based attacks Israel's power authority has experienced and that it was responded to by members of his ministry and the country's National Cyber Bureau.

- A representative for Israel's Electricity Authority said some of its computer systems had been shut down for two days in response to the attack.

- Researchers still aren't sure if the malware known as BlackEnergy was the direct cause of the blackout, but they have confirmed the malicious package infected at least three of the regional power authorities that were involved in the outage.

- Researchers have since said the attack was extremely well-coordinated. Post corrected throughout to reflect the hack reportedly hit Israel's Electricity Authority.

## Debian NTP Servers Harvesting and Scanning Private IP Space for Vulnerabilities

- This suggests the possibility of a firewall log scraper, scapy script, or another low level means of IP harvesting, and also suggests that the ntp application itself on these time servers was probably not customized in any way.   New: On a whim I tried sending an empty packet to port 321 on an affected server (2604:a880:0400:00d0:0000:0000:0009:b00d) and lo and behold, it triggered a scan.

- Chances are there is a Scapy script running or a firewall log scraper, which is collecting the IP Addresses of incoming connections and then passing that to the port scanner which resides elsewhere.

- This part is a bit technical and I'll provide samples below, but in general I increased the rate at which random IPv6 addresses expired and thus were re-generated and assigned.

- It then transforms attributes from the primary search and executes a second query to uncover which outbound packets most likely triggered the scan with great accuracy.

-    Until we know the true intentions of those behind this operation we can assume at very least that the data can and will be reported on, and at worst exploited and injected with malware.

-  New Mersenne Prime Discovered, Largest Known Prime Number: 2^74,207,281 - 1  (mersenne.org) 

- Dave Knott writes: The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) has discovered a new largest known prime number, 2^74,207,281-1, having 22,338,618 digits.

- The same GIMPS software recently uncovered a flaw in Intel's latest Skylake CPUs, and its global network of CPUs peaking at 450 trillion calculations per second remains the longest continuously-running "grassroots supercomputing" project in Internet history.

- The prime is almost 5 million digits larger than the previous record prime number, in a special class of extremely rare prime numbers known as Mersenne primes.

- It is only the 49th known Mersenne prime ever discovered, each increasingly difficult to find.

## Internet of Things security is so bad, theres a search engine for sleeping kids

- Shodan, a search engine for the Internet of Things (IoT), recently launched a new section that lets users easily browse vulnerable webcams. The feed includes images of marijuana plantations, back rooms of banks, children, kitchens, living rooms, garages, front gardens, back gardens, ski slopes, swimming pools, colleges and schools, laboratories, and cash register cameras in retail stores, according to Dan Tentler, a security researcher who has spent several years investigating webcam security. "It's all over the place," he told Ars Technica UK.

- "As we expand that connectivity, when we get into systems that affect public safety and human lifemedical devices, the automotive space, critical infrastructurethe consequences of failure are higher than something as shocking as a Shodan webcam peering into the baby's crib.

- We will include analysis and comparative ratings, on the robustness and security in software, for IoT devices as well as more traditional operating systems, applications and services. Mudge told Ars that "The procedures and methodologies will be made public in 2016.

- The Internet is a minefield of accidents and adversaries, and reducing opportunistic malware infection, like preventing Conficker.B infection of police body cams, is low-hanging fruit. But unlike the electrical appliances Underwriters Laboratories has traditionally tested for safety, or even Euro NCAP's safety ratings that have encouraged car makers to manufacture safer vehicles, both regulation and cybersecurity product ratings seem powerless to stop determined attackers. When Mudge announced his plan to form CITL back in June, security researcher Rob Graham went so far as to call the plan a dumb idea: Its not the same quality problem UL is about accidental failures in electronics.

- Stopping attacks is something nobody has solved in any field. In other words, the UL model of accidents is totally unrelated to the cyber problem of attacks. Graham affirmed his critique in a Twitter direct message to Ars.

## Sean Penn's Opsec

- For the record, that did not work out very well for former CIA director David Petraeus, who used draft messages to communicate with his mistress and got busted when her IP address was targeted in an online harassment investigation.

- Elsewhere in the article, Penn says Guzman corresponded with Mexican actress Kate del Castillo via BBMs (Blackberry messages).

- And Mexican officials have told the media that they were monitoring del Castillo for months, following a meeting she had last summer with El Chapo's lawyers, before she had reached out to Penn.

- Law enforcement even reportedly got photos of Penn's arrival at the airport in Mexico.

- In the most impressive operational, if not personal, security on display, Sean Penn says that when he traveled to Mexico, he left all of his electronics in Los Angeles, knowing that El Chapo's crew would force him to leave them behind.

## A Versatile NFC Card Emulator, and more... on @Kickstarter httpst.coSffntxQyy3

- ChameleonMini

- Have you ever wondered how contactless card systems, e.g., used for door openers and micro payments, work and whether they provide protection against digital fraud?

- Do you want to develop your own NFC tag or contactless card, including your own state machine and security algorithms, or even your own physical specification for an RFID system?

- These and many more applications were the reason for the "birth" of ChameleonMini: a versatile NFC emulator, log tool, and (after this kickstarter project) a basic RFID reader.

## Project Zero Raising the Dead

-  Its a bit late for Halloween but the ability to resurrect the dead (processes that is) is an interesting type of security issue when dealing with multi-user Windows systems such as Terminal Servers.

- For example the following code will spawn the command prompt on the current physical desktop, useful to test Local System elevation of privilege vulnerabilities:

- When a new AppContainer process is started the creator also adds a few new directories for supporting named resources for a specific Package SID (which represents the identity of the LowBox token).

- This of course isnt a security issue in normal circumstances as youll only ever create a process with the original callers privilege, but in this case its a problem because the thread token refers to a different Session ID.

- Fortunately this is pretty easy to solve, the lifetime of these directories are maintained by reference counting and we already have a way of keeping kernel objects alive through referencing them in a LowBox token.

## Oracle deprecates the Java browser plugin, prepares for its demise

- The much-maligned Java browser plugin, source of so many security flaws over the years, is to be killed off by Oracle.

- A future release will remove it entirely. Of course, Oracle's move is arguably a day late and a dollar short.

- Microsoft's new Edge browser also lacks any support for plugins.

- Taken together, it doesn't really matter much what Oracle does: even if the company continued developing and supporting its plugin, the browser vendors themselves were making it an irrelevance.

- Only Internet Explorer 11, itself a legacy browser that's receiving only security fixes, is set to offer any continued plugin support. Nonetheless, the deprecation will inevitably upset large corporations and governments who have ignored the writing that is so clearly on the wall and continued to insist that their employees use Java applets hosted within the browser.

## High-severity bug in OpenSSL allows attackers to decrypt HTTPS traffic

- high-severity vulnerability that made it possible for attackers to obtain the key that decrypts communications secured in HTTPS and other transport layer security channels.

- only when a variety of conditions are met.

- First, it's present only in OpenSSL version 1.0.2. Applications that rely on it must use groups based on the digital signature algorithm to generate ephemeral keys based on the Diffie Hellman key exchange. By default, servers that do this will reuse the same private Diffie-Hellman exponent for the life of the server process, and that makes them vulnerable to the key-recovery attack.

## Intel's SGX security extensions: Secure until you look at the detail

- A pair of cryptography researchers have published a graduate thesis that accuses Intel of ruining its Software Guard Extensions (SGX) with bad implementation decisions.

- in 2013, SGX added CPU features that let programmers create locked containers of code and data, with hardware enforcing access to both the code and data inside the container.

- The problem section is highlighted by us: 
provisioning keys are passed over the internet

- The SGX patents disclose in no uncertain terms that the Launch Enclave was introduced to ensure that each enclaves author has a business relationship with Intel, and implements a software licensing system

## Default settings in Apache may decloak Tor hidden services

- Websites that rely on the Tor anonymity service to cloak their server address may be leaking their geographic location and other sensitive information thanks to a setting that's turned on by default in many releases of Apache, the world's most widely used Web server. The information leak has long been known to careful administrators who take the time to read Tor documentation, but that hasn't prevented some Tor hidden services from falling victim to it.

- Details include the number of requests per second sent to the server, the most recent HTTP requests received, CPU usage, and in some cases the approximate longitude of the server. It would appear some hidden services still haven't figured out that many Apache installations display the data by default.

- In a blog post published over the weekend, an anonymous poster wrote: I've discovered several such exposures over the last six months, reporting them wherever a contact was provided.

- Toward the end of 2015, I found a popular .onion search engine that had failed to disable the status module.

- Forget 0days, traffic analysis, and crypto attacks; it's simple mistakes like this that bite the hardest. Finding vulnerable servers is as easy as appending /server-status to the base onion address of the hidden service.

## Google plugs Android vulns

- Five "critical," four "high" severity and one merely "moderate" bug make up the menu of Android security patches, which are now available for Nexus devices and will flow through to myriad other devices when it rains up instead of down. The critical bugs relate to Broadcom and Qualcomm WiFi drivers, Android's Mediaserver, Qualcomm's performance module, and the Android debugger daemon.  

- CVE-2016-0801 and CVE-2016-0802, the Broadcom WiFi driver vulns, that allow remote code execution in the context of the kernel, so long as attacker and victim are associated with the same network.

- Once again, crafted messages can crash the server, leaving the target open to remote code execution.

- The same applies to the escalation of privilege bug in the buggered Debuggerd daemon: exploitation could leave you with a brick that has to be re-flashed.   There's a Minikin library bug (CVE-2016-0808) that could send the user into perpetual reboot hell; privilege escalation bugs in the Android WiFi component (CVE-2016-0809) and (another) in Mediaserver (CVE-2016-0810). The libmediaplayerservice cops a patch for an information disclosure vulnerability, CVE-2016-0811.

- This bug could "permit a bypass of security measures," the Android security team says  without much more detail  but the result could be an attacker getting "Signature or signatureOrSystem permissions" that are usually blocked from third-party apps. Finally, the Setup Wizard has a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-0812 and CVE-2016-0813) letting an attacker reset a target device, if they get their hands on it. "Builds LMY49G or later and Android M with Security Patch Level of February 1, 2016 or later address these issues," the advisory says. Partners were told about the vulnerabilities on January 4, and "source code patches for these issues will be released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository over the next 48 hours.

## Chip chomped as dev's debug backdoor found in Android phones

- Budget smartphones from Lenovo, Huawei, and other largely Chinese brands contain an accidental backdoor that grants intruders root access. The confirmed affected smartphones run Chinese company MediaTek's MT6582 chipset and are exposed to unauthorised root access thanks to a debugging feature left over from development.  

- The Register has inquired with the company regarding which other handsets may be affected.

- MediaTek has chips in popular HTC, Sony, and other higher-end models. MediaTek told Gadgets360 the flaws affect phones running Android 4.4 KitKat. "We are aware of this issue and it has been reviewed by MediaTek's security team," the company says. "It was mainly found in devices running Android 4.4 KitKat, due to a debug feature created for telecommunication interoperability testing in China.

- " Android KitKit is still the most popular version despite being first released in 2013 and superseded by the much-improved 5.0 Lollipop and 6.0 Marshmallow releases. Some 36 percent of all Android devices connecting to Google Play as of last month run KitKat.  So Mediatek broke basic security features to have this backdoor work.

- pic.twitter.com/pEjtMNpo9v  Justin Case (@jcase) January 13, 2016    The flaws mean attackers can create applications that when installed on stock phones allow evildoers to gain total control of devices. Malicious applications often require users to manually root their devices to gain that level of access. This creates a huge opportunity for attackers since those affected users running Android 4.4 are reasonably unlikely or unable, thanks to slack telcos and manufacturers, to apply patches. Anyone connecting the cheap Chinese phones to the less-than-rigourously-curated third party app stores popular in China is at a significantly elevated risk of having phones compromised.

## Microsoft Edge's Private Browsing Mode Isn't Actually Private

- JustAnotherOldGuy writes: The forensic examination of most web browsers has proven that they don't have a provision for storing the details of privately browsed web sessions.

- Previous investigations of the browser have resulted in revealing that websites visited in private mode are also stored in the browser's WebCache file.

- The Container_n table stores web history, and a field named 'Flag' with a value of '8' shows that website was visited in private mode.

- An investigator can easily spot the difference and use this evidence against a person.

- The not-so-private browsing featured by Edge makes its very purpose seem to fail, and you can't help but ask how such a fundamental aspect of private browsing could be so fantastically borked.

## Using Intel SGX Enclaves in NFC-enabled TPM-based Local Attestation

- Local attestation here means: authenticating the computer that the user possesses a valid hardware token and authenticating to the user that the computer is executing the intended code, and that said code has not been tampered with. The idea is to use some NFC-enabled smart wearable device, something trivially hideable on (or inside1) ones person in order to authenticate to the TPM, which then validates that the next stage of code to be executed, e.g.

- The output then is presented as a QRcode on the screen, which the user scans into the external device (a smart phone, in this case) which also runs TOTP to check that the TPM verification was successful. Smart phones being security nightmares, its nice in my opinion to avoid them altogether.

- Alternatively, one could also imagine some smart2 jewelry3 such as a necklace or bracelet (cufflinks could also be pretty badass) with an embedded NFC-capable smartcard.

- Unfortunately, smartcard means youre likely running in a JVM... which  my livid hatred for the Java programming language aside  hasnt exactly had the best track record in terms of security.

- via Joannas Anti-Evil Maid system, however only post boot and unsure if this would be capatible with using some the extra protections against malicious SMM code, like verifying the RAMstage upon wake from S3, which Coreboot can provide).
