## Security Audit: Scrapyd

- 1. Project name and egg storage issues

A malicious attacker could specify through project setting in scrapy.cfg the directory where to upload the egg file. It could be any directory (escaping from eggs_dir setting) where the user running scrapyd has write permissions.

- . Stored Cross Site Scripting at /

- 6. Stored Cross Site Scripting at /jobs

- . Job id and spider name causing directory traversal

Creating a malicious spider name:

class ExampleSpider(scrapy.Spider):  
    name = "../../../../../tmp/spider"

## ElasticZombie Botnet - Exploiting Elasticsearch Vulnerabilities

- This blog post analyzes what happens if you run a vulnerable service that is connected to the internet resulting in your server becoming a compliant member of a botnet.

- Over a period of 3-months we collected more than 30 different bots, giving us enough interesting stuff to play with and analyze.

## Adobe is telling people to stop using Flash

-  Adobe is finally ready to say goodbye to Flash.

- Though Flash initially had great success as a tool for creating web games and animations, it has a number of downsides that have stood out more and more each year.

- Flash pages and players can be slow to load and a big drain on laptop batteries.

- Adobe says it will be working with Microsoft and Google to maintain Flashs compatibility and security inside of web browsers.

- Adobe says that it expects to see Flash use continue, for now, in web gaming and premium video, because HTML5 or other standards have yet to fully mature to meet those areas needs.

## 600,000 cable routers found to have a backdoor within a backdoor

- Brazilian researcher discovers double security threat in Arris cable modems which allows an attacker to rewrite the firmware without the owner's knowledge.  I'm pretty sure bad guys had been exploiting flaws on these devices for some time (just search for ARRIS DNS on Twitter, for example), he warned. A broader view on firmware is not only beneficial, but necessary to discover new vulnerabilities and backdoors, correlating different device families and showing how vulnerabilities reappear across different products. Rodrigues said that the cable modem maker was slow to give feedback on the flaws he reported and it was only posting to CERT/CC that helped bring the issue to its attention. In a statement released to the media, Arris said that it was aware of the recently reported password vulnerability. The risk related to this vulnerability is low, and we are unaware of any exploit related to it.

- " A spokeswoman for Arris told SCMagazineUK.com that the issue doesn't affect modems in the UK. Gavin Reid, VP of threat intelligence at Lancope, told SC that backdoors in software are always a bad idea. They are especially bad when the software or device is connected directly to the internet, and even worse when the device itself is what you use to connect to the internet.

- " "An attacker could use this 'feature' to create themselves their own account on the router and then monitor all the traffic that flows through it including email and websites visited.

- The Arris router backdoor would allow the worst of all possible activities: monitoring or rerouting someone's internet communications.

## Critical 'Port Fail' Vulnerability Reveals Real IP Addresses of VPN Users

- A newly discovered flaw affecting all VPN protocols and operating systems has the capability to reveal the real IP-addresses of users' computers, including BitTorrent users, with relative ease.

- The vulnerability, dubbed Port Fail by VPN provider Perfect Privacy (PP) who discovered the issue, is a simple port forwarding trick and affects those services that:

Allow port forwarding
Have no protection against this specific attack

- successful IP address leak attack requires an attacker to be on the same VPN network as the victim and to know the victim's VPN exit IP address,

## Google can remotely bypass the passcode of 74% of all Android devices

- Older versions of Android can be remotely reset by Google if the company is issued with a court order, but only if they're locked using a pattern.

- Devices running Android 5.0 and newer cannot be remotely reset as they use full disk encryption.

- The report found any device using an older version of the operating system is vulnerable to remote reset and according to the Android Developer Dashboard, this is 74.1 per cent of Android devices currently being used.

- He said: 'Google has no ability to facilitate unlocking any device that has been protected with a PIN, Password, or fingerprint.

## ISIS website is hacked and replaced with an advert for Viagra

- An ISIS propaganda website on the dark web has been hacked and replaced with an advert for a service selling prozac and viagra tablets which told extremists to 'calm down.

- ' The site for the terror group appeared on the Tor browser of the dark web last week in a bid to get extremists to join up. However, less than a week later, the site had been hacked and visitors to the page were greeted with a message for the medication. Scroll down for video Before it was hacked, people visiting the ISIS website on the dark web were greeted with messages in Arabic But after the Ghost Security Group infiltrated the site, it was replaced with an advert for medication at an online pharmacy It read: 'Too much ISIS.

- Please gaze upon this lovely ad so we can upgrade our infrastructure to give you ISIS content you all so desperately crave.

- ' According to the IBT, the website was taken down by Ghost Sec, a group of hackers loosely affiliated to fellow hacking group Anonymous. It is believed to be the first time that a hacking group have taken down a website on the dark web. The dark web is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. Hacking group Anonymous, known for their signature Guy Fawkes masks, pictured, has promised to hunt down militant jihadists online following the terrorist attacks in Paris last week which left 130 people dead Meanwhile, fellow hacking group Anonymous has promised to hunt down militant jihadists online following the terrorist attacks in Paris last week which left 130 people dead. Anonymous' declaration of war came in a video posted on the group's French YouTube page shortly after the Paris attacks, where they warned the terror group to 'expect us', vowing to hunt down those responsible online and expose them. Wearing the group's signature Guy Fawkes mask, a spokesman says in French: 'Anonymous from all over the world will hunt you down. 'You should know that we will find you and we will not let you go.

- Expect massive cyber attacks.

## ISIS parks its cash in Bitcoin, experts say | Fox News

- One account contained $3 million worth of bitcoin, a GhostSec member told Michael S. Smith II, a co-founder of Kronos Advisory, a national security advisory firm. Ghost Security Group wants to make an impact in counterterrorism, Smith said, adding that the GhostSec member reached out to him because government officials were not paying close attention to the allegations. Related: Has Anonymous's war against ISIS been doing more harm than good? Smith said U.S. counterterrorism officials are concerned that ISIS is acquiring gold and using numerous financial tools, including bitcoin, to tap into markets.

- Bitcoin accounts are set up with virtual money, but the digital funds can be cashed in for real money or goods. Related: #BrusselsLockdown request for social media blackout prompts flood of cat pictures A Ghost Security Group member said ISIS virtual currency amounts to between 1 percent and 3 percent of its total income  between $4.7 million and $15.6 million.

- The 9/11 Commission determined that it cost between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and carry out the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Ghost Security Group hackers insist the alleged ISIS bitcoin account was not linked to the Paris attacks, but they say it shows that terror networks have found a way to transfer assets without easy detection. Related: Sony's PlayStation 4 could be terrorists' communication tool, experts warn The bitcoin universe is decentralized by design, according to Juniper Research, a firm that identifies online market trends.

- Theyre transferred seamlessly via nameless digital wallets. Cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright, a senior fellow at the Center for Digital Government, a national research and advisory institute on information technology policies, says terrorists are increasingly utilizing 21st century technology to transfer assets and finance operations Terrorists need anonymity, Wright said.

- Networks have looked for new ways to do it, and it appears theyve found it in bitcoin. Government officials have become increasingly concerned about these unregulated financial systems, and the U.S. is starting to apply money laundering regulations to cyber currencies.

- Originally posted by demonic-occurence666  1.2 billion web credentials hacked

- The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has filed documents that show 1.2 billion web credentials were stolen by a Russian gang.According to Reuters, the FBI investigation was based on an announcement from a security company Hold Security that it believed the Russian gang, called CyberVor, stole 1.2 billion credentials and as many as half a billion email addresses.The FBI found posts in Russian hacking forums that a mr.grey either operated or had access to stolen data.This mister grey had offered to make available account details for Facebook and Twitter users.Hold Security revealed earlier this year that 420,000 websites were hacked, but this investigation is different.US prosecutors have charged three men for alleged cyber crime offences for hacking into a number of websites, including JP Morgan Chase.

## Hackers knock out ISIS's Dark Net propaganda site

- The free software is used by millions of people around the world,and its funded in large part by the U.S. government.The Islamic State thought theyd found a safe haven.

- Instead, hackers have turned their site into a shooting gallery.Ghost Security, a hacktivist collective fighting ISISs vast online presence, targeted Isdarat soon after it first appeared in its new location.

- The Isdarat franchise has been a powerful propaganda tool for ISIS but also a constant target of attacks, hence the move to perceived safety of the Dark Net.But that perception doesnt match reality.

- As recently as earlier this month, some of the Dark Nets most popular websitesblack markets selling illegal wares like drugs and stolen datareported massive denial-of-service attacks that put sophisticated storefronts out of operation for extended periods.Hidden websites operating in the Tor network, which are not accessible from a normal Web browser like Chrome or Firefox, offer a lot of extra protectionsbut theyre not bulletproof.Isdarats troubles mirror wider challenges to ISISs online presence.Messaging network Telegram is now actively censoring the Islamist militantswhile American social networks like Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook remain hostile terrain.Despite its losses online, ISIS remains a prolific presence across the Internet.As part of a coordinated post-Paris media campaign, ISIS supporters are producing multiple videos, infographics, and audio recordings daily that are then broadcast out to the world through networks like Twitter and Telegraph, even as both networks attempt to squash ISIS accounts as rapidly as they pop up.Photo via Christiaan Colen/Flickr(CC by 2.0) | Remix by Max Fleishman

## Tor use skyrockets in Bangladesh after government bans social networks

- Now, users can stay entirely within the Tor network while visiting Facebook.The government deployed police and soldiers to quell unrest following the executions on Sunday.The trials for the opposition politiciansmost of whom were members of the countrys largest Islamist partywere criticized by international human rights groups,like Human Rights Watch, for potentially falling short of global standards.

- The government denied that charge as it proceeded with the executions despite widespread protests.Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, the one executed politician who was not a member of the main Islamist party, was a leader in the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the countrys leading opposition party.The Bangladeshi government argued that the Internet bans were necessary to counter the threat posed by groups like the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

- Bangladesh has faced routine political violence in recent years as well as threats of expansion from ISIS.Eight other opposition politicians are awaiting execution following convictions for crimes committed during the 1971 civil war.Tarana Halim, the governments telecommunications minister, said that security was the governments main priority.We are sorry for the inconvenience of the users, even I am suffering for it, but we need to understand the situation, Halim said in a statementlast week.The government has blocked Facebook and online messaging services WhatsApp and Viber until further notice on security grounds, Halim said.

## Superfish 2.0: Dangerous Certificate on Dell Laptops breaks encrypted HTTPS Connections - Hanno's blog

- I've provided an online check, affected users should delete the certificate. It seems that Dell hasn't learned anything from the Superfish-scandal earlier this year: Laptops from the company come with a preinstalled root certificate that will be accepted by browsers.

- Therefore attackers can use Man in the Middle attacks against Dell users to show them manipulated HTTPS webpages or read their encrypted data. The certificate, which is installed in the system's certificate store under the name "eDellRoot", gets installed by a software called Dell Foundation Services.

- This is a compromise in the implementation that allows the operation of so-called TLS interception proxies. I was made aware of this issue a while ago by Kristof Mattei.

- In that case Dell wouldn't have installed the private key on the system. Affected are only users that use browsers or other applications that use the system's certificate store.

- Similar vulnerabilities were found in other software products, for example in Privdog and in the ad blocker Adguard. This article is mostly a translation of a German article I wrote for Golem.de. Image source and license: Wistula / Wikimedia Commons, Creative Commons by 3.0 Update (2015-11-24): Second Dell root certificate DSDTestProvider I just found out that there is a second root certificate installed with some Dell software that causes exactly the same issue.

## 'Spying' on Islamic State instead of hacking them - BBC News

- In the wake of the Paris attacks, the vigilante hacker group Anonymous has declared war on so-called Islamic State using the internet and claims to have shut thousands of Twitter accounts used by IS operatives.

- But the director of Ghost Security Group said volunteers live in the US, Europe, and the Middle East, and include linguists and people familiar with intelligence gathering techniques.Instead of trying to shut down accounts and attack jihadi websites with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks - basically flooding a website with traffic to take it offline - Ghost Security Group members operate more like spies than hackers.

- They monitor suspected IS Twitter accounts and infiltrate militant message boards to find information, which they say they then pass along to law enforcement.We would much prefer to stop attacks than shut down websites, the executive director said.

- It stops them from recruiting young kids that have no place to go or people that are sick in the head, an Anonymous operative told BBC Radio 4s Profile.

- Were trying to identify any social media accounts that may have been involved in communicating about those attacks, he said, adding that when it comes to future plots we definitely hope to uncover them before they happen.Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: A brief history of online trolling by Western and Russian diplomats

## Using Markov chains as a keyed obfuscation method

- a project that has been sitting in my private git repository for a long while, and after I was recently reminded of it, Ive decided to write it up and do an initial release. The premise of the project is to use Markov chains in order to obfuscate binary information to appear similar to written language.

## Even the LastPass Will be Stolen Deal with It!

- so I though it was worth writing a post with all the details of our talk. Motivation During one of Albertos red team pentests, he gained access to several machines and found that all of them had files with references to LastPass.

- 10% of our time is for research so we made that our small project. We found how creds where stored locally and wrote a Metasploit plugin so he could use it to extract vault contents from all the compromised machines.

- Thanks to the module, he was able to obtain SSH keys to critical servers and the pentest was a success. I blogged about it in the past and it became very popular on reddit. We got a lot of feedback, questions, comments and suggestions.

- We had the same thought when we stumbled upon this functionality and we wanted to understand how it worked. The process In order to recover/decrypt your vault if you happened to forget the master password, youd need to visit the Recover Account site, provide your email and initiate the recovery.

- The best part is that now you know how to decrypt them and everything you need is right there. The problem here is that people are posting their prefs.js in forums looking for help on broken Firefox configurations, removing spyware, toolbars, etc.

## A Timeline of Terrorism

- The recent terrorist attacks in Paris have unfortunately once again brought terrorism to the front of many people's minds.

- Surprisingly though, terrorism had actually been decreasing from a peak in the late 80's and early 90's before this recent increase. What day of the year is most dangerous? Another interesting question to ask that is a bit hard to eyeball from the heatmap above by itself, is if there are particular days that are more likely to have terrorist attacks than others.

- Seeing as how we saw a drastic increase in the number and deadliness of attacks over the same timespan though it is clear that the groups that are active presently are increasingly more active and deadly than previous terrorist groups. Summary This initial analysis has confirmed that it is not just our perception that terrorism has been increasing over time4, and that there has been a real spike in terrorist activity in the last five years.

- Furthermore we've seen that:  Well known holidays such as Christmas seem to influence overall terrorist activity Terrorists are targeting ordinary citizens over military or government targets While the number of attacks have grown, the number of groups has not kept pace - meaning that the current crop of terrorist groups is more active than their historical counterparts  Further work could break down the types of attacks on each day (for example, is only a certain type of attack less likely on Christmas Day?)

- In particular the data shows South Asia has almost as many terrorist attacks as the Middle East and North Africa, a surprising result considering the focus of most news coverage in the US. Have more ideas or suggestions about how to use this data?

## Xposed framework now supports Android 6.0 Marshmallow - customize away!

- I find that its best for those who do not want a full-blown change of experience, but would prefer to tweak a few things here and there. All the user would need to install Xposed is a custom recovery and a rooted phone (of course).

- Especially dm-verity would definitely conflict with the modifications of the system partition. Access to preferences files might be blocked by SELinux, and Xposed is currently not able to work around that.

- (*) Some modules might be affected by this, nevertheless I strongly recommend to keep SELinux enabled and enforcing to keep your device as safe as possible. I could not test all Xposed APIs.

- The system is booting without any error messages from Xposed, but some functions that the framework makes available might still need to be adjusted for Marshmallow. Obviously, modules themselves might need to be updated as well due to changes in AOSP.

- If you absolutely cannot live without module X, dont update to Marshmallow yet. Some issues might arise from JIT (disabled by default, even in AOSP) and the optimizing compiler (which rewrites apps code to be more efficient, due to which some calls might simply be skipped).

## Next Big Future: Google planning a watershed quantum computing announcement for December 8

- According to Steve Jurvetson, venture capitalist and board member at pioneer quantum computing company D-WAVE, Google has what may be a watershed quantum computing announcement scheduled for early next month.

- This comes as D-WAVE, which notably also holds the Mountain View company as a customer, has just sold a 1000+ Qubit 2X quantum computer to national security research institution Los Alamos. Jurvetson says to stay tuned for more information coming on December 8th.

- This is the first weve heard of a December 8th date for a Google announcement, and considering its purported potential to be a turning point in computing, this could perhaps mean an actual event is in the cards. On Flickr, Steve Jurvetson mentioned that Los Alamos just purchased a D-Wave 2X with over 1000 qubits.

- And stay tuned for what may be a watershed announcement from Google on Dec 8.

## Beware of ads that use inaudible sound to link your phone, TV, tablet, and PC

- Flickr user: Lulu visionPrivacy advocates are warning federal authorities of a new threat that uses inaudible, high-frequency sounds to surreptitiously track a persons online behavior across a range of devices, including phones, TVs, tablets, and computers. The ultrasonic pitches are embedded into TV commercials or are played when a user encounters an ad displayed in a computer browser.

- Cross-device tracking allows marketers to combine these streams by linking them to the same individual, enhancing the granularity of what they know about that person. The officials said that companies with names including SilverPush, Drawbridge, and Flurry are working on ways to pair a given user to specific devices.

- The technology, which is typically not disclosed and cant be opted out of, makes it possible for marketers to assemble a shockingly detailed snapshot of the person being tracked. For example, a company could see that a user searched for sexually transmitted disease (STD) symptoms on her personal computer, looked up directions to a Planned Parenthood on her phone, visits a pharmacy, then returned to her apartment, the letter stated.

- While previously the various components of this journey would be scattered among several services, cross-device tracking allows companies to infer that the user received treatment for an STD.

- No one has ever proven badBIOS exists, but the use of the high-frequency sounds to track users underscores the viability of the concept. Now that SilverPush and others are using the technology, its probably inevitable that it will remain in use in some form.

## EMV Protocol Fuzzer - mwrlabs

- Since EMV is based on the ISO 7816 standard, which secures inter-operation between smartcards and associated terminals, this research also applies to other implementations where smartcards are present such as in subscriber identity modules (SIMs) and DTV decoders. Although the standard defining EMV is in principal secure, vulnerabilities can easily be introduced into the terminal-smartcard authentication procedure by the hardware and software specific implementation of the actual EMV-enabled device.

- Recent work by [3] indicated the ease, at that time, with which vulnerabilities could be found in existing POS devices by using a programmable smartcard, without the need for sophisticated card-emulating or man-in-the-middle attack hardware.

- This case lends itself particularly well to an automated electronic solution, such as an EMV fuzzing device, which would be able to test a target terminal for potential vulnerabilities in a fast, controlled and reproducible manner.

- After the correct vulnerability disclosure procedure has been followed with affected parties, the remaining results will be published. The communication stream between a Point-of-sale (POS) terminal and a VISA smart card (ICC) is captured.

## Researcher's public browsing history demos anti-privacy law

- This guy is making his browser history public to show you the effects of the UKs anti-privacy bill

- Security researcher Brett Lempereur has nothing to hide in his browsing activity. Or maybe he does. Regardless, anyone in the world can see which sites hes visiting in real-time on this page.

- ICREACHAround is named in reference to ICREACH, a search engine built by the US National Security Agency to allow nearly two dozen government agencies to sift through 850 billion records about citizens phone calls, emails, cellphone locations, and chats.

## LA's New Streetlamps Will Keep Cell Service Running After an Earthquake

- Cities beefing up their smart infrastructure have tapped the ubiquitous streetlamp to track traffic data and measure pollution.

- The location of the poleswhich are closer to the streets and sidewalks where people are actually using their phones than central cell towersgives the network the advantage of being more equally dispersed across the region.

- While better day-to-day cell service is a great feature, the real benefit here in LA is that the system wont be as likely to be knocked out by, I dunno, say, a major earthquake.

- This increased reliability for the wireless network is especially important in the event of emergencies  so that smartphones stay online when they are needed most, says Peter Marx, Chief Technology Office for the City of Los Angeles.

- The rest of the citys streetlamps are being upgraded to the CityTouch system, which allows their LED lights to be controlled and managed wirelessly.

## Let's Encrypt Entering Public Beta

- Invitations are no longer needed in order to get free certificates from Lets Encrypt. Its time for the Web to take a big step forward in terms of security and privacy.

- Lets Encrypt was built to enable that by making it as easy as possible to get and manage certificates. Wed like to thank everyone who participated in the Limited Beta.

- This allowed us to gain valuable insight into how our systems perform, and to be confident about moving to Public Beta. Wed also like to thank all of our sponsors for their support.

- Were happy to have announced earlier today that Facebook is our newest Gold sponsor. We have more work to do before were comfortable dropping the beta label entirely, particularly on the client experience.

- Automation is a cornerstone of our strategy, and we need to make sure that the client works smoothly and reliably on a wide range of platforms.
