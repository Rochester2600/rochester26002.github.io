Join us this Friday for our first attempt at Infosec Interview Assault.

Here are the rules:

-  Players bring in their interview questions and take turns presenting
   them to the group
-  The Presenter stands up and delivers the question while the rest of
   the group answers
-  When done, the Presenter chooses how to delegate 5 Hacker and 5 Maker
   points.
-  Hacker points (integers) are for technically correct responses and
   can be distributed to between 0 and i 5 people.
-  Maker points (integers) are for terribly wrong answers, answers that
   make the Presenter laugh, or any other willy-nilly reasons to give
   them out.
-  If someone disagrees with the Presenter's decision, they have 15
   seconds to explain why after which time no one cares and moves on.

Meetings begin at 7pm and are held at Interlock Rochester
