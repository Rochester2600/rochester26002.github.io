Sick of the heat and the terrible fireball in the sky? Come to 2600
where we are all air-conditioned and work with the lights out. This
month's meeting will be dedicated to Winter Homes. Those dwellings in
Alaska and Antarctica made with ice and snow; igloos, ice caves, snow
forts, and other Snow Dens.
