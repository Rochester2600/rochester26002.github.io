Join us on Friday 10/4 to learn what sound the fox makes. We will be
hearing from people that have researched the fox, and documented his
native calls. You can learn what sound a fox makes, his dance moves, as
well as learn how to make direct contact with a fox if need by. Also,
just a heads up, an elephant will be joining our meeting.
