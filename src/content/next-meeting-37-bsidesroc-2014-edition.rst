Our next meeting will be the last meeting before `BSidesROC
2014 <http://www.bsidesroc.com>`__. We will pretend that everything is
under control and ignore our responsibilities while we have a normal
2600 meeting. We probably will talk about a few BSidesROC things too.

Presentations this month include:

-  Alex: GPS'ing and Pythoning for RFing and Profiting
-  Jason: Latest fun with XML injection
-  AntiTree: The results of boredom in South Korea
-  AntiTree: To be decided..
-  JustBill: IPv6, NAT, and the answers to to worlds questions
