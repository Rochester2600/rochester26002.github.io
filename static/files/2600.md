## New Mac malware pinned on same Russian group blamed for election hacks | Ar

-                   EnlargeSumitcommunicationcyber    APT28, the Russian hacking group tied to last year's interference in the 2016 presidential election, has long been known for its advanced arsenal of tools for penetrating Windows, iOS, Android, and Linux devices

- Now, researchers have uncovered an equally sophisticated malware package the group used to compromise Macs.Like its counterparts for other platforms, the Mac version of Xagent is a modular backdoor that can be customized to meet the objectives of a given intrusion, researchers from antivirus provider Bitdefender reported in a blog post published Tuesday

- Capabilities include logging passwords, snapping pictures of screen displays, and stealing iOS backups stored on the compromised Mac.The discovery builds on the already considerable number of tools attributed to APT28, which other researchers call Sofacy, Sednit, Fancy Bear, and Pawn Storm

- According to researchers at CrowdStrike and other security firms, APT28 has been operating since at least 2007 and is closely tied to the Russian government

- An analysis Bitdefender published last year determined APT28 members spoke Russian, worked mostly during Russian business hours, and pursued targets located in Ukraine, Spain, Russia, Romania, the US, and Canada."Our past analysis of samples known to be linked to APT28 group shows a number of similarities between the Sofacy/APT28/Sednit Xagent component for Windows/Linux and the Mac OS binary that currently forms the object of our investigation," the Bitdefender researchers wrote in Tuesday's report

- "For once, there is the presence of similar modules, such as FileSystem, KeyLogger, and RemoteShell, as well as a similar network module called HttpChanel."Another similarity is a file path found in the Xagent binary that indicates it was created by the same developer who wrote Komplex, which is a first-stage trojan that Sofacy uses to infect targeted machines

- It was discovered in September by researchers from Palo Alto Networks

- Bitdefender researchers suspect the Mac version of Xagent is being planted by Komplex.In Tuesday's analysis, Bitdefender researchers wrote:Once successfully installed, the backdoor checks if a debugger is attached to the process

## Inside Confide, the chat app 'secretly used by Trump aides': OpenPGP, OpenS

-                                 Rumors that President Donald Trump's aides are using an encrypted messaging app called Confide has landed the software firmly in the spotlight  and under the security microscope.                The Washington Post on Monday mentioned that Confide, built by a startup in New York City, is used by some White House staffers to gossip in private

- The app was billed by the newspaper as "a secret chat app  that erases messages as soon as they're read." The aides, fearful of being accused of leaking to the press, turned to Confide in an attempt to cover their tracks and stay off the radar.                                                                                                        This is not the first time Confide has appeared in the national news conversation

- In 2014, the app was pitched to big biz in the wake of the Sony Pictures network intrusion as a safe means to communicate without being bothered by hackers

- What was missing from Confide's pitch, however, was much in the way of details about how the application delivered on its hefty promise of secure auto-destructing end-to-end encrypted messaging.                Given that foreign spies, as well as Uncle Sam's own snoops, will now definitely be all over this thing like a sore rash, The Register asked Confide for more info: how does the encryption work, what is done to thwart eavesdroppers, and so on.                And we were told the software, available for iOS and Android, basically uses the OpenPGP standard to perform public-private cryptography, uses AES for ephemeral per-message encryption, and exchanges public keys between users via TLS connections with certificate pinning.                To us, this sounds like the public keys travel through Confide's servers via HTTPS with certificate pinning to ensure the software really is talking to its backend systems: if so, it means the app maker can, or be forced to, eavesdrop on conversations by substituting users' keys mid-exchange

- It does mean, though, that it's tricky for others listening in on networks to intercept and successfully crack messages, in theory.                "Confide uses public/private key cryptography with ECDH for key agreement and per-message AES keys to encrypt the message payloads," Confide cofounder and president Jon Brod told El Reg on Tuesday evening.                "In addition, we use recommended best practices to ensure the security of network connections, such as using TLS 1.2 with certificate pinning to prevent against man-in-the-middle attacks."                Using OpenPGP and TLS cert pinning is not a bad start, although we weren't told the key lengths

- The app's methods are better than the questionable home-brew crypto used in some other chat applications

- The software appears to use OpenSSL 1.0.2j, which was last patched for security bugs in September 2016 and isn't FIPS 140-2 validated

- That should rule it out of government use right off the bat, we're told.                "The encryption appears to operate like most other end-to-end encrypted apps, where public and private keys are generated," said computer forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski, who studied the Confide app earlier today.                "In the case of Confide, an ephemeral key seems to be in play to encrypt messages themselves with a symmetric cipher

## Ancient Wisdom Reveals 6 Rituals That Will Make You Happy - Barking Up The Wrong Tree

- You couldnt be more wrong... This part of Stoic philosophy was adapted by famed psychologist Albert Ellis to form Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  which is now the dominant method for helping people overcome problems ranging from depression to anxiety to anger. Most of the bad feelings you have are caused by irrational beliefs. Next time youre feeling negative emotions, dont focus on the event that you think caused them.

- And going back to the first point, it might be a good idea to ask yourself what your belief is thats causing all this worry... Yeah, its probably irrational. (To learn more lifehacks from a variety of ancient thinkers, click here.

- And Seneca, one of the big cheeses of Stoicism, got the point across with this beautiful quote that I love: We like to say that we dont get to choose our parents, that they were given by chance  yet, we can truly choose whose children we wish to be. When I spoke to Anders Ericsson, the professor who came up with the 10,000 hours theory of expertise, he said the first step in being better at anything (and that includes life) is to find a mentor.

- Marcus Aurelius said, Today, the people that you face will be... and then he proceeds to list basically every negative trait you could possibly encounter in the course of a day.

- Lets round it up and get the final tip that science agrees is one of the most powerful happiness boosters...   Sum Up Heres how ancient wisdom from the Stoics can help you be happier:  Events Dont Upset You.

## How to retire in your 30s: save most of your money and rethink your core values

-                                                       This is how you can spend your golden years...and the few decades before that.                    Shutterstock                  Seven in 10 Americans are disengaged from their jobs, according to Gallup

- That's more than two-thirds of us who are unfulfilled by our work, just dragging our sorry selves to and from the office every day.One community has an attractive answer: just quit.A burgeoning online community advocates early retirement

- And they're not talking about people quitting in their 50s or early 60s

- They mean retiring before age 40  perhaps even in their 20s.Over the past few months, I've interviewed seven people who have managed to leave the working world before age 40

- That seems like a crazy idea to most people, but these extreme retirees insist it's something everyone should consider

- What they all understand  and what they wish other people understood  is that achieving financial freedom isn't just about budgeting or clipping coupons; it's about reconsidering your core values.                      Cut down on the big three, then investThe basic framework of early retirement is pretty simple: cut way down on your spending, then invest your savings

- High savings rates can lead to surprisingly fast retirements

- For example, if you save half your income, you'll be ready to retire in around 17 years.And the best place to start on cutting costs isn't with coupons or thrift stores; it's with the big purchases

## A top Putin critic on how to oppose Trump: "making him look like a loser is crucial"

- Garry Kasparov Playing the calm voice of reason isnt my strong suit despite my chess background, but its important to focus on what matters most so you dont lose track in all the noise and chaos that Trump creates so effortlessly.

- As the motto of Soviet dissidents went: Do what you must, and so be it. Alexander Bisley The biggest election-related scandal since Watergate occurred last year, and it has largely disappeared from the political-media landscape of Washington, David Corn wrote this week at Mother Jones.

- This is also the pattern for weakly reported news stories in general, and why the media has to be twice as careful verifying things with regard to Trump instead of jumping at shadows to get a scoop and discrediting themselves in the eyes of the public.

- Even if you are cynical, there is no denying this image is a big element of American soft power in the world, as a nation to be envied and imitated despite its flaws. Alexander Bisley  Trumps claims of 3 to 5 million illegal election ballots cast with zero evidence.

- The European Union may fall apart, and the far right may continue to make advances across Europe. Alexander Bisley Worst case domestically? Garry Kasparov Trump finds excuses to take emergency powers, crack down on the free press and political opposition, the real dictatorship playbook.

## My Management Lessons from Three Failed Startups, Google, Apple, Dropbox, and Twitter

- Kim Scott had one thing to do that day

- She was going to price her product

- It was the year 2000, she was the founder and CEO of Juice Software, and she had blocked off her whole morning to make this decision.The moment she stepped off the elevator, she was met by co-worker after co-worker who needed and wanted to talk to her  one about a health concern, another about his kid excelling at school, another about a disintegrating marriage

- She comforted, celebrated with, and listened to each one in turn

- She didnt, however, price the product.For a minute I thought, this is where the assholes really have the advantage, says Scott

- But thats not right either

- Good managers give a damn.This is just one piece of advice Scott discovered during the last 20 years, and has carried with her through leadership roles at some of the biggest and influential tech companies in the world

- Most recently, she advised Dropbox and Twitter

## What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness

- What keeps us happy and healthy as we go through life? If you think it's fame and money, you're not alone  but, according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, you're mistaken

- As the director of a 75-year-old study on adult development, Waldinger has unprecedented access to data on true happiness and satisfaction

- In this talk, he shares three important lessons learned from the study as well as some practical, old-as-the-hills wisdom on how to build a fulfilling, long life.

## History tells us what may happen next with Brexit & Trump

- Taking one telling of events as gospel doesnt wash in the comparative analytical method of research that forms the core of British academia.

- Well summed up here: By targeting frail people of all ages, and killing them by the hundreds of thousands within an extremely short period of time, the Black Death might have represented a strong force of natural selection and removed the weakest individuals on a very broad scale within Europe, ...In addition, the Black Death significantly changed the social structure of some European regions.

- During the Centenary of the Battle of the Somme I was struck that it was a direct outcome of the assassination of an Austrian Arch Duke in Bosnia. I very much doubt anyone at the time thought the killing of a European royal would lead to the death of 17 million people.My point is that this is a cycle.

- You can blame society, politicians, the media, for America getting to the point that its ready for Trump, but the bigger historical picture is that history generally plays out the same way each time someone like him becomes the boss.On a wider stage, zoom out some more, Russia is a dictatorship with a charismatic leader using fear and passion to establish a cult around himself.

- NATO is slow to respond: Trump does not want America to be involved, and a large part of Europe is indifferent or blocking any action.

## Stop Spending So Much Time In Your Head - Darius Foroux

- I bet you spend A LOT of time in your head. You know, thinking, worrying, stressing, freaking out  call it whatever you want.

- Charles Sanders Peirce, who was a Harvard professor, is considered as the father of Pragmatism. But it was William James, a trained physician turned philosopher, who really defined the philosophy. About thoughts, worry, and stress, William James says: The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another. Pragmatism believes that the mind is a tool.

- People who dont master their mind, dont believe its possible. They say: I cant help but thinking these things. Well, you can with enough practice.

- Guilt, anger, suffering. I just have one question for you: Whats the practical use of your thoughts? Yes?

- 99% of them that is. Which thoughts are useful?  Thinking about how you can solve problems.

## The Condensed Guide to Running Meetings

- I asked Axtell and Francesca Gino, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of Sidetracked: Why Our Decisions Get Derailed, and How We Can Stick to the Plan whether much of the conventional wisdom holds true. 1.

- The research finds that the more time people spend using multiple forms of media simultaneously, the least likely they are to perform well on a standardized test of multitasking abilities, explains Gino. The second reason to ban devices is that they distract others.

- Gino recently conducted a simple survey that assessed whether people thought reaching for a phone, posting a status on Facebook, or writing a tweet during a meeting was distracting or socially inappropriate.

- This may be due to cultural reasons, or language barriers, or general disposition. The people who hold back often have the best perspective on the conversation and definitely need to be drawn out. Having everyone contribute isnt just good for the end result of your meeting but for the participants themselves as well.

- Having a plan gives us the opportunity to clarify our intentions and think through the forces that could make it difficult for us to accomplish our goals, she says. There is a lot of data out there that shows how much time were all wasting in meetings.

## Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence

- WASHINGTON  Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials.American law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three of the officials said.

- And it is not unusual for American businessmen to come in contact with foreign intelligence officials, sometimes unwittingly, in countries like Russia and Ukraine, where the spy services are deeply embedded in society.

- officials believe that the former British intelligence officer who compiled the dossier, Christopher Steele, has a credible track record, and he briefed investigators last year about how he obtained the information.

- Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the news about Mr. Flynn underscored how many questions still remain unanswered to the American people more than three months after Election Day, including who was aware of what, and when.Mr.

- A version of this article appears in print on February 15, 2017, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump Aides Had Contact With Russian Intelligence.

## You probably know to ask yourself, What do I want? Heres a way better question

- Everybody wants what feels good

- Everyone wants to live a carefree, happy and easy life, to fall in love and have amazing sex and relationships, to look perfect and make money and be popular and well-respected and admired and a total baller to the point that people part like the Red Sea when you walk into the room.Everyone would like thatits easy to like that.If I ask you, What do you want out of life? and you say something like, I want to be happy and have a great family and a job I like, its so ubiquitous that it doesnt even mean anything.A more interesting question, a question that perhaps youve never considered before, is what pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for? Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out.Everybody wants to have an amazing job and financial independencebut not everyone wants to suffer through 60-hour work weeks, long commutes, obnoxious paperwork, to navigate arbitrary corporate hierarchies and the blase confines of an infinite cubicle hell

- People want to be rich without the risk, without the sacrifice, without the delayed gratification necessary to accumulate wealth.Everybody wants to have great sex and an awesome relationshipbut not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings and the emotional psychodrama to get there

- And so they settle

- They settle and wonder What if? for years and years and until the question morphs from What if? into Was that it? And when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail they say, What was that for? if not for their lowered standards and expectations 20 years prior, then what for?Because happiness requires struggle

- The positive is the side effect of handling the negative

- You can only avoid negative experiences for so long before they come roaring back to life.At the core of all human behavior, our needs are more or less similar

- Positive experience is easy to handle

## Google's Not-so-secret New OS

- Much about it is still unknown, but according to the documentations Google has provided on its website, it's clear that the Fuchsia is the actual name of the operating system, and the kernel is called Magenta.

- Google is unsurprisingly bringing up Andromeda on a number of platforms, including the humble Intel NUC.

- ARM, x86, and MIPS bring-up is exactly what you would expect for an Android successor, and it also seems clear that this platform will run on Intel laptops.

- But Google can't push two UI APIs as equal app frameworks over the long term: Mojo is clearly the future.

- Mojo was originally created to "extract a common platform out of Chrome's renderer and plugin processes that can support multiple types of sandboxed content.

## Voice Calls May Be Coming To the Amazon Echo and Google Home

- 89237333story Voice Calls May Be Coming To the Amazon Echo and Google Home  (theverge.com)   Amazon and Google are interested in adding the ability to make and receive phone calls to their popular home speaker devices -- Echo and Home, reports WSJ, adding that telecom regulations and privacy are some of the things both the companies are tackling

- If the companies are able to sort out the issues, the feature could make way to the home speaker devices as soon as this year, the paper reported

- From The Verge: There's also the fact that you would only make calls over speakerphone, which could limit the usefulness of the feature for some users

- Theoretically, it would be easier for Google to get a phone service up and running on the Home, given that it's been operating Google Voice for seven years and launched Project Fi back in 2015, while Amazon has to start from scratch to get its phone service up and running

- According to the Journal, Amazon is considering a number of different options, including syncing to the user's existing phone number, call forwarding, or the Echo getting its own phone number.

- From a report on NBC: Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told Congress on Tuesday the measure was one of several being considered to vet refugees and visa applicants from seven Muslim-majority countries

- "We want to get on their social media, with passwords: What do you do, what do you say?" he told the House Homeland Security Committee

- "If they don't want to cooperate then you don't come in."

## GitHub Commits Reveal The Top 'Weekend Programming' Languages

- An anonymous reader writes: Google "developer advocate" Felipe Hoffa has determined the top "weekend programming languages," those which see the biggest spike in commit activity on the weekends.

- "Clearly 2016 was a year dedicated to play with functional languages, up and coming paradigms, and scripting 3d worlds," he writes, revealing that the top weekend programming languages are:  Rust, Glsl, D, Haskell, Common Lisp, Kicad, Emacs Lisp, Lua, Scheme, Julia, Elm, Eagle, Racket, Dart, Nsis, Clojure, Kotlin, Elixir, F#, Ocaml   Earlier this week another data scientist calculated ended up with an entirely different list by counting the frequency of each language's tag in StackOverflow questions.

- But Hoffa's analysis was performed using Google's BigQuery web service, and he's also compiled a list of 2016's least popular weekend languages -- the ones people seem to prefer using at the office rather than in their own free time.

- In the last year Perl has become more popular than Java, PHP, and ASP as a weekend programming language.

- And Rust "used to be a weekday language," Hoffa writes, but it soon also grew more popular for Saturdays and Sunday.

## Internet Backbone Provider Cogent Blocks Pirate Bay and Other 'Pirate' Site

- 89128743story Internet Backbone Provider Cogent Blocks Pirate Bay and Other 'Pirate' Sites  (torrentfreak.com)   Several Pirate Bay users from ISPs all over the world have been unable to access their favorite torrent site for more than a week

- Their requests are being stopped in the Internet backbone network of Cogent Communications, which has blackholed the CloudFlare IP-address of The Pirate Bay and many other torrent and streaming sites, reports TorrentFreak

- From the article: When the average Internet user types in a domain name, a request is sent through a series of networks before it finally reaches the server of the website

- This also applies to The Pirate Bay and other pirate sites such as Primewire, Movie4k, TorrentProject and TorrentButler

- However, for more than a week now the US-based backbone provider Cogent has stopped passing on traffic to these sites

- The sites in question all use CloudFlare, which assigned them the public IP-addresses 104.31.18.30 and 104.31.19.30

- While this can be reached just fine by most people, users attempting to pass requests through Cogent's network are unable to access them.

## Microsoft Allowed To Sue US Government Over Email Surveillance

-  Microsoft Allowed To Sue US Government Over Email Surveillance  (bloomberg.com) 

- A judge has ruled that Microsoft is allowed to sue the U.S. government over a policy that prevents the tech company from telling its users when their emails are being intercepted.

- From a report on Bloomberg: The judge said Microsoft has at least made a plausible argument that federal law muzzles its right to speak about government investigations, while not ruling on the merits of the case.

- "The public debate has intensified as people increasingly store their information in the cloud and on devices with significant storage capacity," U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle said in Thursday's ruling.

- "Government surveillance aided by service providers creates unique considerations because of the vast amount of data service providers have about their customers.

## Bipartisan Bill Seeks Warrants For Police Use of 'Stingray' Cell Trackers

- 89240675story Bipartisan Bill Seeks Warrants For Police Use of 'Stingray' Cell Trackers  (usatoday.com)   Tulsa_Time quotes a report from USA Today: A bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers introduced legislation Wednesday requiring police agencies to get a search warrant before they can deploy powerful cellphone surveillance technology known as "stingrays" that sweep up information about the movements of innocent Americans while tracking suspected criminals

- "Owning a smartphone or fitness tracker shouldn't give the government a blank check to track your movements," said Sen

- Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee who introduced the bill with Reps

- Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and John Conyers, D-Mich

- "Law enforcement should be able to use GPS data, but they need to get a warrant

- This bill sets out clear rules to make sure our laws keep up with the times." The legislation introduced Wednesday, called the Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance (GPS) Act, would require a warrant for all domestic law enforcement agencies to track the location and movements of individual Americans through GPS technology without their knowledge

- It also aims to combat high-tech stalking by creating criminal penalties for secretly using an electronic device to track someone's movements.

## Goldman Sachs Automated Trading Replaces 600 Traders With 200 Engineers

- Goldman Sach's New York headquarters has replaced 600 of its traders with 200 computer engineers over the last two decades or so, thanks to automated trading programs.

- "Marty Chavez, the company's deputy chief financial officer and former chief information officer, explained all this to attendees at a symposium on computer's impact on economic activity held by Harvard's Institute for Applied Computational Science last month," reports MIT Technology Review.

- From their report:  The experience of its New York traders is just one early example of a transformation of Goldman Sachs, and increasingly other Wall Street firms, that began with the rise in computerized trading, but has accelerated over the past five years, moving into more fields of finance that humans once dominated.

- Chavez, who will become chief financial officer in April, says areas of trading like currencies and even parts of business lines like investment banking are moving in the same automated direction that equities have already traveled.

- Goldman Sachs has already begun to automate currency trading, and has found consistently that four traders can be replaced by one computer engineer, Chavez said at the Harvard conference.

## Google Releases TensorFlow 1.0 With New Machine Learning Tools

- An anonymous reader shares a VentureBeat report: At Google's inaugural TensorFlow Dev Summit in Mountain View, California, today, Google announced the release of version 1.0 of its TensorFlow open source framework for deep learning, a trendy type of artificial intelligence.

- Google says the release is now production-ready by way of its application programing interface (API).

- Now there are more traditional machine learning tools, including K-means and support vector machines (SVMs), TensorFlow's engineering director, Rajat Monga, said at the conference.

- And there's an integration with the Python-based Keras library, which was originally meant to ease the use of the Theano deep learning framework.

- And there are now "canned estimators," or models, Monga said, including simple neural networks to start using quickly.

- The company also found a number of access points using outdated WEP encryption

- So much for security pros... At least two people stayed connected to a rogue network for more than a day, according to the article, and Pownie Express is reminding these security pros that connecting to a rogue network means "the attacker has full control of all information going into and out of the device, and can deploy various tools to modify or monitor the victim's communication."

## Congressman Calls For Probe Into Trump's Unsecured Android Phone

- 89289081story Congressman Calls For Probe Into Trump's Unsecured Android Phone  (cnet.com)   An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNET: President Donald Trump regularly makes news because of his tweets

- Now a congressman is making news because of the device the president reportedly uses to tweet

- On Friday, Congressman Ted Lieu, a Democrat from Los Angeles, wrote a letter to the House Oversight Committee requesting an investigation into Trump's cybersecurity practices

- In particular, he calls out Trump's apparent decision to keep using his personal Android phone instead of a secured phone the Secret Service issued him for his inauguration

- The letter is also signed by 14 other members of Congress and calls for a public hearing to discuss the issues

- "The device President Trump insists on using -- most likely the Samsung Galaxy S3 -- has particularly well documented vulnerabilities," the letter says

- "The use of an unsecured phone risks the president of the United States being monitored by foreign or domestic adversaries, many of whom would be happy to hijack the president's prized Twitter account causing disastrous consequences for global security

- Cybersecurity experts universally agree that an ordinary Android smartphone, which the president is reportedly using despite repeated warnings from the Secret Service, can be easily hacked."

- A New Zealand judge just ruled they can all be extradited to the U.S

- An anonymous reader quotes Reuters:The Auckland High Court upheld the decision by a lower court in 2015 on 13 counts, including allegations of conspiracy to commit racketeering, copyright infringement, money laundering and wire fraud, although it described that decision as "flawed" in several areas

- Dotcom's lawyer Ron Mansfield said in a statement the decision was "extremely disappointing" and that Dotcom would appeal to New Zealand's Court of Appeal. U.S

- authorities say Dotcom and three co-accused Megaupload executives cost film studios and record companies more than $500 million and generated more than $175 million by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material

- High Court judge Murray Gilbert said that there was no crime for copyright in New Zealand law that would justify extradition but that the Megaupload-founder could be sent to the United States to face allegations of fraud. "I'm no longer getting extradited for copyright," Dotcom commented on Twitter

## 99.6 Percent of New Smartphones Run Android or iOS

- According to the report, Android and iOS accounted for 99.6 percent of all smartphone sales in the fourth quarter of 2016.

- For comparison, this figure was 96.8 percent in the second quarter of 2015.

- The once-great firm sold just over 200,000 units, amounting to 0.0 percent market share.

- It's worth noting that although, in retrospect, this state of affairs seems inescapable, for years analysts were predicting otherwise.

- Three years ago, Gartner said that Microsoft's mobile OS would overtake iOS for market share in 2017, while BlackBerry would still be hanging around as sizable (if small) player.

Well, that question has an official answer today, as the Mozilla Thunderbird packages appear to have landed in the Debian repositories as a replacement for Icedove, the rebranded version that Debian Project was forced to use for more than ten years due to trademark issues

-  "Thunderbird is back in Debian! We also renamed other related packages to use official names, e.g

- iceowl-extension - lightning

- For now, we need testers to catch existing issues and things we haven't seen until now," said Christoph Goehre in the mailing list announcement

- You can find out how to migrate your Icedove profiles to Thunderbird via Softpedia's report.

## USB Killer now lets you fry most Lightning and USB-C devices for $55

- Remember the USB Killer stick that indiscriminately and immediately fries about 95 percent of devices?

- And you can also buy an adaptor pack, which lets you kill test devices with USB-C, Micro USB, and Lightning ports.

- " Since we last reported on the USB Killer, it seems the Hong Kong-based company has also secured FCC approval in addition to the European CE mark.

- A spokesperson for USB Killer told Ars that the Lightning adaptor "bypasses the authentication check," without providing any more details.

- " It isn't clear which iOS devices are actually vulnerable to the USB Killer, though we know it fries the port on the iPhone 7, which then gets stuck during boot-up.

## Google claims massive Stagefright Android bug had 'sod all effect'

-                                 RSA USA Despite shrill wailings by computer security experts over vulnerabilities in Android, Google claims very, very few of people have ever suffered at the hands of its bugs.                Speaking at the RSA security conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Adrian Ludwig, director of Android security, said the Stagefright hole  which prompted the Chocolate Factory to start emitting low-level security patches on a monthly basis  did put 95 per cent of Android devices at risk of attack

- However, there have been no confirmed cases of infections via the bug, Ludwig claimed.                                                                                                        It was a similar story for the MasterKey vulnerability that was spotted in 2013, he said

- In that case, 99 per cent of Android devices were vulnerable, but exploits abusing the security blunder peaked at less than eight infections per million users, it was claimed

- And there were no exploits for the hole before details of the flaw were made public.                He also cited the 2014 FakeID flaw, disclosed at Black Hat that year

- This affected 82 per cent of Android users but exploits peaked at one infection per million users after the details were released, and none before that, we're told.                Ludwig said he was sure of his figures, due to malware-detection routines, dubbed Verify Apps, in Google Play services, which is installed on more than 1.4 billion Android handhelds

- Verify Apps reports back to Google when a software nasty is spotted on the device, allowing the web giant to tot up infection tallies.                So, basically, Ludwig's claims and figures cover devices with Google Play services installed  Chinese and Amazon Android-based gadgets don't include this software and thus aren't part of the Googler's numbers.                It also fitted a pattern he had noticed, that there isn't really any complex malware out there in the wild infecting Android devices

- Software nasties tend to be sleazy apps, installed by punters, that do unpleasant things in the background, rather than malicious code that silently infects devices via webpages, text messages, and so on.                Most of the abuse we get isnt interesting from a security perspective, he said

- We see spamming ads for fake antivirus stuff but its really basic social engineering

## New ASLR-busting JavaScript is about to make drive-by exploits much nastier

- By randomizing the computer memory locations where application code and data are loaded, ASLR makes it hard for attackers to execute malicious payloads when exploiting buffer overflows and similar vulnerabilities.

- Whereas heap spraying and other forms of ASLR bypass can often be mitigated by software tweaks, there isn't much that can stop or lessen the effects of the JavaScript, which targets a CPU's MMU, or memory management unit.

- Instead, our attack builds on hardware behavior that is central to efficient code execution: the fast translation of virtual to physical addresses in the MMU by means of page tables.

- The paper was written by Ben Gras, Keveh Razavi, Erik Bosman, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida of the VUsec systems security group at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

- They have published this resource page with additional information about the technique. Given how crucial caching is to the performance of modern CPUs, the researchers say architectural fixes are likely to be too costly to be feasible.

## As Microsoft touts Windows Insider for biz, let's take a look at W10's brok

-                                 For months now, the Windows 10 Anniversary Update has broken two-factor logins using certain smart cards  and Microsoft has refused to discuss it.                According to Reg readers writing in, and W10 users on support forums, folks who have Yubikey two-factor authentication gadgets have been hitting frustrating error messages when trying to log in with the latest flavor of Windows 10

- Ideally, you plug your key into the USB port and type in your password, and together they authenticate you

- For some, that stopped working.                                                                                                        In forum posts dating back all the way to September 2016, fed-up Microsoft customers have complained that when logging in locally to their machines with the smart cards, they get "Error 7" messages

- The cards still work on earlier editions of Windows, and users running bleeding-edge Windows Insider builds say their cards now work.                Other users report speaking with Yubikey support staffers on this issue, only to be told the problem was on Microsoft's end  and that there was no timetable for it to be fixed.                Despite this issue having been reported on for several months now, Redmond is keeping quiet

- We asked the operating system giant for comment, and in return we got silence: no explanation, no workaround, no nothing

- The lights are on, the barriers are down, but no train is coming.                "There is a bug in the windows 10 Anniversary Update that prevents the use of Yubikey smart cards for local login," one cheesed-off Reg reader, a director-level tech pro in the UK, told us.                "This showstopper of a bug must be known to Microsoft, as they have fixed it in the Insider preview fast-ring release

- They will not publicly acknowledge it, and there is no suggestion that they will patch it either."                We pinged Yubikey-maker Yubico earlier in the day about this login issue

- A couple of hours later, just as we were going to press, a spokesperson for the security hardware biz got in touch to say a hotfix is available to address the problem

## House members: EPA officials may be using Signal to spread their goals cov

-   Enlarge / Chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee Lamar Smith, R-Texas, seen here in 2013.Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call  

- Two Republican members of Congress sent a formal letter Tuesday to the Environmental Protection Agencys Office of the Inspector General, expressing concern that approximately a dozen career EPA officials are using the encrypted messaging app Signal to covertly plan strategy and may be running afoul of the Freedom of Information Act.  The open source app has gained renewed interest in the wake of the election of President Donald Trump.

- However, unlike other messaging apps, Signals maker, Open Whisper Systems, makes a point of not keeping any data, encrypted or otherwise, about its users.

- (WhatsApp also does not retain chat history but allows for backups using third-party services, like iCloud, which allows for message history to be restored when users set up a new device.

- This request is under review by the Inspector General and his senior leadership team.

## Crypto-curious? Wickr's opened its kimono for code review

-                                 Ephemeral messaging application Wickr has opened up the core crypto software of its Wickr Professional app so others can review it.                The repository is at GitHub.                                                                                                        At this stage, the company is not offering the code for re-use

- It's published under a purpose-written review license only, although the company says an open-source release under the GNU licence is on the cards.                So what's in the box, so to speak?                To avoid single-library dependencies, the company says it's organised Wickr Professional to expose its security primitives in an organised and generic way.                In other words, while the app uses OpenSSL 1.0.2, other libraries could be supported

- Supported OpenSSL primitives include AES 256 (GCM and CTR); SHA from 256 to 512; various elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman flavours; SCRYPT and BCRYPT; HMAC (keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code) and HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF).                As described in this white paper, the protocol provides:                End to End Encryption  Messages and encryption keys are available only within Wickr applications and are not disclosed to network attackers or Wickr server operators;Perfect Forward Secrecy  Old message content is not compromised if the long-term key of a user or device is compromised

- Backward secrecy is also provided against passive adversaries; andProtection of Metadata - Node identity information stored in message headers is hidden from attackers who lack message context and source information.                As well as the crypto module, the other key pieces of the application's architecture are the protocol itself (the low-level implementation that encodes and decodes encrypted messages); and Context.                Context provides, as Wickr explains, a high level interface for managing an endpoint that can send and receive encrypted message packets  which is how client front-ends integrate with the crypto library.                The protocol is also extensible, so in the future it could support non-text file content like file transfers, audio, and video.                Announcing the publication of the software, CEO Joel Wallenstrom adds that Wickr has added Austrian crypto-boffin Joel Alwen (of that country's Institute of Science and Technology) to its team

- Alwen first came to El Reg's attention more than a decade ago, when worked with an Electronic Frontiers Foundation team to decode the dot-patterns that identified laser printers for spooks.                Wallenstrom says both the crypto source code and the white paper have already had an independent review: I want to thank Whitfield Diffie, Paul Kocher, Dan Kaminsky, Adam Shostack, Scott Stender, and Jesse Burns for their insightful feedback and invaluable advice.                Wickr's not the first secure messaging app to allow this kind of review: rival Signal released its code in November 2016

-

## Trumps apparent security faux-pas-palooza triggers call for House investig

- Representative Ted Lieu, a congressman from Los Angeles County, California, led fourteen other House Democrats on Friday in urging the House Government Oversight Committee to investigate "troubling reports" of President Donald Trump's apparently poor security practices and the potential danger to national security posed by themincluding his continued use of an unsecured Android device to post to Twitter, discussion of sensitive information (including nuclear strategy) in the restaurant at his Mar-A-Lago resort, and leaving classified material unlocked while visitors were in the Oval Office.

- In a letter to Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz and ranking Democratic member Elijah Cummings, the fifteen representatives wrote: Referring to the complex problem of cybersecurity, President Trump recently said in an interview, "Im not sure you have the kind of security that you need."

- Cybersecurity experts universally agree that an ordinary Android smartphone, which the President is reportedly using despite repeated warnings from the Secret Service, can be easily hacked. Lieu and the other signatories of the letter expressed concern that Trump's Android device, "most likely the Samsung Galaxy S3," is particularly vulnerable to attack, and that someone could alter the information the President viewed on itwhich could "have a huge impact on his beliefs and actions."

- They also feared that someone could gain control of his Twitter account, "causing disastrous consequences for global stability," or use it as a listening device to pick up sensitive conversations. Also cited by the letter were photos from a recent White House visit by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich that showed a key still in the lock of a bag for classified material on Trump's desk.

- The photo was called out by Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico in this Twitter post:  Never leave a key in a classified lockbag in the presence of non-cleared people.

## Secure Trump website defaced by hacker claiming to be from Iraq

-   Enlarge / Oops.  

- Someone calling themselves "Pro_Mast3r" managed to deface a server associated with President Donald Trump's presidential campaign fundraising on Sunday, The server, secure2.donaldjtrump.com, is behind Cloudflare's content management and security platform, and does not appear to be directly linked from the Trump Pence campaign's home page.

- But it does appear to be an actual Trump campaign serverits certificate is legitimate, but a reference to an image on another site is insecure, prompting a warning on Chrome and Firefox that the connection is not secure. The page, now displaying an image of a man in a fedora, displays the following text: Hacked By Pro_Mast3r ~ Attacker Gov Nothing Is Impossible Peace From Iraq The source code contains a link to  javascript on a now-nonexistent Google Code account, masterendi, previously associated with the hacking of at least three other websites.

- As Italian IT journalist Paolo Attivissimo pointed out, an archive of the script shows it to be a snow animation script, not malware. Ars reached out to both Cloudflare and the Trump-Pence campaign team for comment.

- As more information becomes available, we'll update this report. [Update 4:00 pm Eastern Time] The server is now offline.

## The USB Killer: Now Faster, Better, More Anonymous

-  A few years ago, [Dark Purple] built the USB equivalent of an RJ45 connector wired into mains power.

- Plug this device into your computer and -220V is dumped directly into the USB signal wires.

- Theres also an anonymous version that looks like every other USB thumb drive sourced from Hong Kong.

- This is your warning: never, ever plug an unknown USB thumb drive into your computer. While a product announcement really isnt news, it is extremely interesting to take a look at how something that should not exist is being marketed.

- As with all electronic destructive devices, its on your Amazon recommended products list alongside tactical kilts, fingerless gloves, beard oil, and black hoodies.

## Using SDR to Take Control of Your Home Security System

-         [Dan Englender] was working on implementing a home automation and security system, and while his house was teeming with sensors, they used a proprietary protocol which was not supported by the open source system he was trying to implement

- The problem with home automation and security systems is the lack of standardization  or rather, the large number of (often incompatible) standards used to ensure consumers get tied in to one specific system

- He has shared the result of his efforts at getting the two to talk to each other via his project decode345.The result enabled him to receive signals from Honeywells 5800 series of wireless products and interface them with OpenHAB  a vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software

- OpenHAB offers bindings that allow a wide variety of systems and hardware to be integrated

- Unfortunately for [Dan], this exhaustive list does not yet include support for the (not very popular) 345MHz protocol used by the Honeywell 5800 system, hence his project.The hardware used is plain vanilla  a cheap SDR dongle connected to a Raspberry Pi 3

- His code, available on Github, along with OpenHAB, are lightweight enough to run comfortably on the Pi 3

- The software side is a bit involved, and his blog post walks you through the code as well as the process he used to accomplish this

- The Python- and C-based decoder captures the sensor signals

## FCC chief wants smartphones hidden FM radios turned on

- It seems odd that every day we hear about a new smartphone app that lets you do something innovative, yet these modern-day mobile miracles dont enable a key function offered by a 1982 Sony Walkman, Pai said this morning, during a speech at a North American Broadcasters Association event, according to prepared remarks. Pai has for years been advocating for smartphone manufacturers to enable these radios.

- In his speech this morning, he even says you could make a case for activating chips on public safety grounds alone, since radio could enable phones to receive emergency alerts even when wireless networks are down.

- He believes the FCC doesnt have the power to issue such a mandate and says its best for the market to sort things out. This is no doubt frustrating to radio stations and consumers.

- Even Pai points out what a benefit this would be, saying most consumers would love to access some of their favorite content over-the-air, while using one-sixth of the battery life and less data. And therein also lies the problem.

- You can view that list here. With Pai ruling out FCC action, the fate of smartphones FM radios remains in manufacturers hands.

## Police Body Cams Have Real-Time Facial Recognition

- The police body camera industry is the latest to jump on the artificial intelligence bandwagon, bringing new powers and privacy concerns to a controversial technology bolstered by the need to hold police accountable after numerous high-profile killings of unarmed black citizens

- Now, that tech is about to get smarter.Last week, Taser, the stun gun company that has recently become an industry leader in body-mounted cameras, announced the creation of its own in-house artificial intelligence division

- The new unit will utilize the companys acquisition of two AI-focused firms: Dextro, a New York-based computer vision startup, and Misfit, another computer vision company previously owned by the watch manufacturer Fossil

- Taser says the newly formed division will develop AI-powered tech specifically aimed at law enforcement, using automation and machine learning algorithms to let cops search for people and objects in video footage captured by on-body camera systems.Moreover, the move suggests that body-worn cameras, which are already being used by police departments in many major cities, could soon become powerful surveillance tools capable of identifying different objects, events, and people encountered by officers on the street  both retroactively and in real time.The idea is to use machine learning algorithms to streamline the process of combing through and redacting hours of video footage captured by police body cameras

- Dextro has trained algorithms to scan video footage for different types of objects, like guns or toilets, as well as recognize events, like a foot chase or traffic stop

- The result of all this tagging and classifying is that police will be able use keywords to search through video footage just like theyd search for news articles on Google, allowing them to quickly redact footage and zoom in on the relevant elements

- Taser predicts that in a years time, their automation technology will reduce the total amount of time needed to redact faces from one hour of video footage from eight to 1.5 hours.A Dextro demonstration shows real-time classification of people and objects in videoTaserSearchable video will also have major implications for civilian privacy, especially since there are no federal laws preventing police from trawling through databases to track people en masse.Taser has previously expressed interest in adding face recognition capabilities to its body camera systems

- A Department of Justice study published last year also found that at least nine different body camera manufacturers either currently support face recognition in their products or have the ability to add it later

## Your personal Facebook Live videos can legally end up on TV

- Think again. One father who live-streamed his partners labour on Facebook last May, has found out the hard way: he saw the birth of his son replayed on Good Morning America and numerous other media outlets. This week, he lost a high-profile court battle against the broadcasters. If you dont want this to happen to you, dont make the same mistakes. Personal equals private? Its one thing wanting to share a life-changing moment with friends and family.

- But most would understand why Kali Kanongataa didnt want his childs birth aired for all to see. That hasnt however, stopped a US judge throwing out Kanongataas copyright infringement case against the likes of the ABC, Yahoo, and Rodale, the company that publishes Womens Health. Apparently, the father-to-be realised his film was streaming publicly on social media about 30 minutes into recording, but decided to leave it that way. About 120,000 people worldwide tuned in. Media outlets broadcasting the clips have defended doing so on the terms of fair use. What does this mean to you? Legally, fair use means that when pictures or videos are the focus of a major news story, selected footage can be used. And, given that its believed to have been the first time Facebook Live had been used to broadcast a birth, ABC deemed the affair a socially significant phenomenon. This weeks ruling can therefore be taken to mean that if you use social media in a newsworthy way, it could be seized and shared, however personal the content. Weve already witnessed proposals, operations and torture on social media.

- But consider the number of firsts that have yet to take place on Facebook, or on other video sharing platforms like Instagram or Snapchat. Has someone recorded their grannys final moments as they pass away yet?

- Has anyone received the all-clear from cancer on Facebook Live? The only real way to stop these from going viral is not to stream them in the first place.

- Kitty previously worked as an online journalist for GQ.

## Zerocoin implementation bug

- A typographical error on a single additional character in code allowed an attacker to create Zerocoin spend transactions without a corresponding mint.

- We urge all pools and exchanges to update once the release is out. From what we can see, the attacker (or attackers) is very sophisticated and from our investigations, he (or she) did many things to camouflage his tracks through the generation of lots of exchange accounts and carefully spread out deposits and withdrawals over several weeks.

- In other words, the damage has already been mostly absorbed by the markets. To clarify a few things:  The exploit happened due to the bug in the code and not from any weakness in the cryptography. The bug  from the typo error allowed the attacker to reuse his existing valid proofs to generate additional Zerocoin spend transactions. The anonymity of Zerocoin has not been compromised. We knew we were being attacked when we saw that the total mint transactions did not match up with the total spend transactions.

- Trading will resume once pools and exchanges have had time to update their code.

- A new release will be pushed out pretty soon. Prior to this announcement we had disclosed the hack to the exchanges for them to assist in our investigations.

## Zuckerberg thinks he's cyber-Jesus

Because last night it looks like the Zuck stayed up late with a couple of university freshmen and solved the world's problems, making sure they wrote it down so they didn't wake up in the morning and forget it.                                                                                                        Behold a 6,000-word manifesto from the CEO and cofounder of Facebook that he probably shouldn't have handed in but, you know, when you're utterly filthy rich, every problem looks solvable...                "On our journey to connect the world, we often discuss products we're building and updates on our business

- Today I want to focus on the most important question of all: are we building the world we all want?"                So it begins

- And the insights just keep tumbling out from there:                History is the story of how we've learned to come together in ever greater numbers  from tribes to cities to nations

- At each step, we built social infrastructure like communities, media and governments to empower us to achieve things we couldn't on our own.                At this point every history teacher in history is preparing their red Biro pen because, you know, most history actually comprises people working together to prevent themselves from dying

- But let's go with "empowering" themselves for now.                "Today we are close to taking our next step." That's today

- It's happening right now and, let's be honest, most of it is happening on Facebook

- All those pictures and updates  that is where the real work of humanity is occurring right now.                Of course Zuckerberg isn't an ego-maniac

- He knows that an electronic message board is a fun and useful thing but isn't really going to solve the world's ills; issues that have tormented mankind for millennia

Exfiltration experts from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev's Cyber Security Research Center have added to previous techniques like fan modulation, GSM transmissions, or listening to the RF from USB2 transmissions, have now created malware to control hard drive LEDs.                                                                                                        The team led by veteran exfiltrator Mordechai Guri flashes the LED at atound 5,800 on/off cycles per second as a data channel, good enough for 4 Kbps of transmission.                That performance also depends on what you use as the receiver: it might be a Digital SLR or high-end security camera (15 bps), a GoPro-level camera (up to 120 bps), a Webcam or Google Glass Explorer (also 15 bps), or a smartphone camera (up to 60 bps).                If you can lay hands on a good photodiode sensor  they're not expensive, the Thorlabs PDA100A they used can be had on eBay for less than US$100  you'll get around 4 Kbps.                In the video below, the researchers fitted the detector to a drone, flew it to a window through which the infected disk was visible and started sucking data.                  Youtube Video                Since PCs lack any generic API to control the hard disk LED, the malware from Guri's team takes the direct approach: a small chunk of code to perform reads and writes to the disk, along with a protocol to tell the receiver what it's looking for.                Here's the prize  the algorithm that flashes the HDD lamp.                1: procedure transmitBits(bits, T0, ReadSize)2: sync(); //drop cache3: hddDev = open(/dev/sda)4: offset = 05: offsetIncrement = BLOCK_SIZE;6: seek(hddDev, offset);7: for(b in bits)8: if (b='0') then9: sleep (T0);10: if (b='1') then11: seek(hddDev, offset);12: read(hddDev, ReadSize);13: offset += offsetIncrement14: end for15: return;                                Bootnote: There's a little bit of life imitating art here, as in Neal Stephenson's Crytponomicon, the sysadmin protagonist decrypts data on his laptop and outputs the result as morse code flashed on his laptop's LEDs.

## At deaths door for years, widely used SHA1 function is now dead

- Git, the world's most widely used system for managing software development among multiple people, relies on it for data integrity.

- By forging the digital signature used to cryptographically prove the authenticity of Microsoft servers, Flame was able to spread from one infected computer to another inside targeted networks. Now, researchers have demonstrated a similar type of real-world attack against SHA1, which ironically was widely adopted after the insecurity of MD5 became well known.

- The first phase of the attack was run on a heterogeneous CPU cluster that was hosted by Google and spread over eight physical locations.

- That's within the $75,000 to $120,000 range CWI's Stevens projected in late 2015. Consistent with Google's security disclosure policy, the source code for performing the collision attack will be published in 90 days.

- That means Git and unknown number of other widely used services that rely on SHA1 have three months to wean themselves and their users off the insecure function.

## Health Apps Could Be Doing More Harm Than Good, Warn Scientists

- 89361031story Health Apps Could Be Doing More Harm Than Good, Warn Scientists  (theguardian.com)   According to several scientists, fitness apps might be doing more harm than good because they don't work but force people to focus on ambitious goals that they will never reach

- Some are so appalled by these apps that they have called it "snake oil salesmen of the 1860s." From a report on The Guardian: Greg Hager, professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, said that in the absence of trials or scientific grounding it was impossible to say whether apps were having the intended effect

- "I am sure that these apps are causing problems," he told the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Boston

- [...] Hager claimed the 10,000 steps target dated back to a 1960s Japanese study that showed there were health benefits for men who burned at least 2,000 calories per week through exercise -- roughly equivalent to 10,000 steps each day

- An early pedometer was known as the manpo-kei, which means "10,000-step meter" in Japanese

- "But is that the right number for any of you in this room?" Hager asked

- "Who knows

- It's just a number that's now built into the apps." "We have an incredible number of apps in the wild basically being downloaded by people who may or may not understand what they are actually telling them or what the context for that is," he said

## AMD Launches Ryzen, Claims To Beat Intel's Core i7 Offering At Half the Pri

- Reader MojoKid writes: AMD CEO, Dr. Lisu Su took to the stage at AMD's Ryzen tech day yesterday and opened the event with official speeds, feeds, pricing, and benchmark scores for the company's upcoming Ryzen series processors.

- AMD's goal with Ryzen, which is based on its Zen microarchitecture, was a 40% IPC (instructions per clock) uplift.

- As it turns out, AMD was actually able to increase IPC by approximately 52% with the final shipping product, sometimes more depending on workload type.

- Dr. Su also showed the first die shot of an 8-core Ryzen processor, disclosing that it consists of approximately 4.8 billion transistors.

- AMD took the opportunity to demo the Ryzen 7 1800X and it was approximately 9% faster than the Core i7-6900K running Cinebench R15's multi-threaded test, at about half the cost.

## iPhone Owners in US Spent $40 Each on Apps in 2016

- Zoey Chong, writing for CNET: iPhone users in the US are spending more and more on apps and in-app purchases.

- Spending climbed to an average of $40 per person last year, according to research released Monday by Sensor Tower.

- Gaming continued to lead the way, accounting for more than 80 percent of Apple App Store revenue in the US.

- Spending in that category increased from $25 on average per person in 2015 to $27 last year.

- This may not be the biggest surprise, given that 2016 witnessed the rise of Pokemon Go, which crossed $1 billion in revenue worldwide last month.

## Computer Glasses Claim To Protect Eyesight Are Selling Like Hotcakes, But T

- 89360681story Computer Glasses Claim To Protect Eyesight Are Selling Like Hotcakes, But They Probably Aren't Useful  (businessinsider.in)   People are increasingly concerned that bright light -- especially "blue light" from computer screens -- is causing harm, making it a potentially dangerous public health issue

- Eyewear and screen protector companies have been selling products they say can protect people from these harms

- But are they really making any difference? From a report: We do know that blue light at night can interfere with sleep, causing a host of negative effects

- But the evidence that the amount of light screen expose us to during the day is harmful is not really there

- Furthermore, many experts think these products are unnecessary and could perhaps do more harm than good

- [...] The research that companies selling blue-blocking products cite falls into three categories: animal studies, in vitro studies of retinal cells exposed to light, and studies of people exposed to outdoor light

- [...] "I think it's largely hype, not science," says Dr

- Richard Rosen, Director of Retina Services at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai and Ophthalmology Research Director at Icahn School of Medicine

## Project Zero Finds A Graphic Zero Day

-         After finding the infamous Heartbleed vulnerability along with a variety of other zero days, Google decided to form a full-time team dedicated to finding similar vulnerabilities

- That team, dubbed Project Zero, just released a new vulnerability, and this ones particularly graphic, consisting of a group of flaws in the Windows Nvidia Driver.Most of the vulnerabilities found were due to poor programming techniques

- From writing to user provided pointers blindly, to incorrect bounds checking, most vulnerabilities were due to simple mistakes that were quickly fixed by Nvidia

- As the author put it, Nvidias drivers contained a lot of code which probably shouldnt be in the kernel, and most of the bugs discovered were very basic mistakes.When even our mice arent safe it may seem that a secure system is unattainable

- However, there is light at the end of the tunnel

- While the bugs found showed that Nvidia has a lot of work to do, their response to Google was quick and positive. Most bugs were fixed well under the deadline, and google reports that Nvidia has been finding some bugs on their own

- It also appears that Nvidia is working on re-architecturing their kernel drivers for security

- This isnt the first time weve heard from Googles Project Zero, and in all honesty, it probably wont be last.

## Hackers who took control of PC microphones siphon >600 GB from 70 targets

-                   EnlargeDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency    Researchers have uncovered an advanced malware-based operation that siphoned more than 600 gigabytes from about 70 targets in a broad range of industries, including critical infrastructure, news media, and scientific research.The operation uses malware to capture audio recordings of conversations, screen shots, documents, and passwords, according to a blog post published last week by security firm CyberX

- Targets are initially infected using malicious Microsoft Word documents sent in phishing e-mails

- Once compromised, infected machines upload the pilfered audio and data to Dropbox, where it's retrieved by the attackers

- The researchers have dubbed the campaign Operation BugDrop because of its use of PC microphones to bug targets and send the audio and other data to Dropbox."Operation BugDrop is a well-organized operation that employs sophisticated malware and appears to be backed by an organization with substantial resources," the CyberX researchers wrote

- "In particular, the operation requires a massive back-end infrastructure to store, decrypt, and analyze several GB per day of unstructured data that is being captured from its targets

- A large team of human analysts is also required to manually sort through captured data and process it manually and/or with Big Data-like analytics."Examples of targets infected in the campaign include:A company that designs remote monitoring systems for oil and gas pipelinesAn international organization that monitors human rights, counter-terrorism, and computer attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructureAn engineering company that designs electrical substations, gas distribution pipelines, and water supply plantsA scientific research instituteEditors of Ukrainian newspapersMost of the 70 organizations known to have been infected in Operation BugDrop are located in Ukraine, a country that in December suffered a hacker-caused power outage

- It came almost exactly a year after a 2015 attack on Ukraine's power grid that caused 225,000 residents to lose electricity

- In both cases, the power facilities had been hacked weeks or months before the outages so that attackers could gather passwords for targeted servers and workstations and create custom malware for them

## Firefox certificate cache leaks user information

-                                 Firefox's intermediate certificate cache can be tricked into leaking to a deliberately mis-configured server, creating yet-another chance to fingerprint users (including those who think they're protected by Private Browsing).                The data leak identified by security researcher Alexander Klink could also let a malicious attacker identify browsers operating in a sandbox (for malware analysis) or not.                                                                                                        When starting a TLS session (for HTTPS), a correctly-configured server, he explains, sends a visiting browser both the intermediate CA (which Firefox caches) and its server CA, while a misconfigured server will only send the server CA

- In the latter case, the site will only load if the user already has the intermediate cached.                That's the genesis of Klink's realisation that if a user's browser behaves differently depending on server config, there might be some way to use that behaviour to infer which intermediate certificates are in their cache  and use that knowledge to create a user fingerprint.                Filed as bug #1334485 by Klink, the bug would let a third party Website send a request, and Firefox will leak the intermediate CAs from its cache

- Having run a proof-of-concept, Klink says it even catches CAs from browsers operating in Private Browsing mode, because that mode doesn't isolate the cache.                Since certificate information is necessarily public, it needed only some time combing Root CA Extract data to build a list of certificate chains, and Project Sonar data to identify misconfigured sites.                As well as fingerprinting users, Klink says, there's a certain amount of mostly geographical data leakage about users' browsing habits.                The issue has raised a lively discussion at the Mozilla list about the severity of the problem and whether it's fixable

- Gervase Markham notes that a useful attack would be non-trivial, while noting however that the authors of the Tor browser might consider disabling caching in their software

-

## 'Hey, Homeland Security. Don't you dare demand Twitter, Facebook passwords

- Over 50 human rights and civil liberties groups, nearly 100 law professors and security experts, and lawmakers have launched a campaign against digital searches at the US border. An open letter condemns recent comments by Homeland Security secretary John Kelly in which he proposed requiring selected non-citizens entering the US to provide the passwords to their social media accounts.  

- The letter has been signed by, among others, the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Democracy  Technology, Consumer Technology Association, Electronic Frontier Foundation and Internet Society, as well as a wide range of law professors, internet engineers and security experts, including Bruce Schneier. "Demanding passwords or other account credentials without cause will fail to increase the security of US citizens and is a direct assault on fundamental rights," the letter argues. It warns that the approach would not only invade people's privacy  including those of US citizens  but also discourage travel to the United States as well as set a dangerous precedent that would likely see other countries institute similar entry requirements for US citizens. "The first rule of online security is simple: Do not share your passwords," the letter concludes.

- " At the same time as the letter was published, others have published posts outlining the dangers of providing passwords and what consumers can do to avoid most of them. New law The issue has also attracted the attention of Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), who sent a letter to Secretary Kelly saying he was "alarmed" by reports of Americans being detained by border agents and being pressured into handing over their smartphone PINs. "These reports are deeply troubling," Wyden noted, "particularly in light of your recent comments suggesting that CBP [US Customs and Border Protection] might begin demanding social media passwords from visitors to the United States.

- There are well-established legal rules governing how law enforcement agencies may obtain data from social media companies and email providers"  rules that require warrants or court orders. He then asks five questions of Kelly, digging into the legal authority that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) feels it possesses to demand passwords, and asks for stats on how often it has happened. Wyden also writes that he will introduce legislation designed to "guarantee that the Fourth Amendment is respected at the border by requiring law enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant before searching devices, and prohibiting the practice of forcing travelers to reveal their online account passwords.

- Meanwhile, people, including British Muslims, are being turned away from America seemingly for no real reason. President Trump is reportedly planning to issue a revised executive order this week that is designed to withstand legal challenge and will continue to cover the seven Muslim-majority countries in the original travel ban order, but only block those arriving without a visa or who have never entered the country previously.

## Hacks all the time. Engineers recently found Yahoo systems remained comprom

- Some five months after Yahoo disclosed a security breach that exposed sensitive data for 500 million accounts, some of its systems remained compromised, according to a report published Tuesday.

- The report said that in light of the hacks, Verizon would knock $350 million off the price it would pay to acquire Yahoo's Internet business. "A recent meeting between technical staff of the two companies revealed that some of Yahoos systems were compromised and might be difficult to integrate with Verizons AOL unit," The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people.

- It wasn't clear precisely when the meeting occurred. In a release issued jointly by Yahoo and Verizon, the companies said neither the breaches nor any losses arising from them will be taken into account in determining whether a "Business Material Adverse Effect" has occurred or whether certain closing conditions have been satisfied.

- In addition to the $350 million price cut, the companies agreed to split the costs of responding to the breaches. Tuesday's report comes a week after Yahoo sent a new round of notifications  warning users that their accounts may have been breached as recently as last year.

- The much more recent compromises were carried out by forging the browser cookies Yahoo servers set after a user logs in to an account.

## US judge halts mass fingerprint harvesting by cops to unlock iPhones

- Analysis An Illinois judge has rejected a warrant sought by the US government to force everyone in a given location to apply his or her fingerprints to any Apple electronic device investigators happen to find there, a ruling contrary to a similar warrant request granted last year by a judge in California. Under current law, the government already has the right, given sufficient evidence, to compel a specific individual to unlock an electronic device protected by a fingerprint reader like Apple's Touch ID sensor.  

- The warrant also lacks information about who is believed to be involved in criminal conduct and the specific Apple device involved. Essentially, prosecutors want to go into a vaguely described location  perhaps a home or an office  and make every inside, regardless of who they are, provide their fingerprints to unlock their Apple handhelds so investigators can rifle through the devices for evidence.

- But where the information is unknown or incriminating, the Fifth Amendment weighs more heavily. 'With a touch of a finger, a suspect is testifying' And in this case, Weisman asserts the government is asking for too much, with too little evidence to support its demand.

- However, Weisman is careful to note that the Fourth and Fifth Amendment obstacles to granting the government's warrant request may be overcome with more specific information. EFF Staff Attorney Andrew Crocker in a phone interview with The Register said: "This is exactly what we hope courts will do, which is when faced with a situation like this to consider the implications of granting a request and to reject the ones that are too broad.

- " The warrant application's reliance on dated boilerplate  it cites BlackBerry devices as common digital assistants  is problematic, the judge wrote, because it means recent technological developments, like wireless internet service, are not addressed.

- A lot of modern distributions enable this option bydefault.The bug was found with syzkaller [2].### Bug detailsIn the current DCCP implementation an skb for a DCCP_PKT_REQUESTpacket is forcibly freed via __kfree_skb in dccp_rcv_state_process ifdccp_v6_conn_request successfully returns [3].However, if IPV6_RECVPKTINFO is set on a socket, the address of theskb is saved to ireq-pktopts and the ref count for skb is incrementedin dccp_v6_conn_request [4], so skb is still in use

- Nevertheless, itstill gets freed in dccp_rcv_state_process.The fix is to call consume_skb, which accounts for skb-users,instead of doing goto discard and therefore calling __kfree_skb.To exploit this double-free, it can be turned into a use-after-free://  The first free:kfree(dccp_skb)// Another object allocated on the same place as dccp_skb:some_object = kmalloc()// The second free, effectively frees some_objectkfree(dccp_skb)As this point we have a use-after-free on some_object

- An attacker cancontrol what object that would be and overwrite it's content witharbitrary data by using some of the kernel heap spraying techniques.If the overwritten object has any triggerable function pointers, anattacker gets to execute arbitrary code within the kernel.I'll publish an exploit in a few days, giving people time to update.New Ubuntu kernels are out so please update as soon as possible.### Timeline2017-02-15: Bug reported to security () kernel org2017-02-16: Patch submitted to netdev2017-02-17: Patch committed to mainline kernel2017-02-18: Notification sent to linux-distros2017-02-22: Public announcement### Links[1] http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-6074[2] https://github.com/google/syzkaller[3] http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/dccp/input.c?v=4.9#L606[4] http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/dccp/ipv6.c?v=4.9#L351[5] https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=5edabca9d4cff7f1f2b68f0bac55ef99d9798ba4  By Date         By Thread  Current thread:Linux kernel: CVE-2017-6074: DCCP double-free vulnerability (local root) Andrey Konovalov (Feb 22)Re: Linux kernel: CVE-2017-6074: DCCP double-free vulnerability (local root) Andrey Konovalov (Feb 26)

## The implications of the end of net neutrality

- Sergey Denisenko serves as chief executive officer for the native performance network MGID, where he oversees the growth and strategic direction of the company.

- Not only that, but the company says its ultimate vision is to allow consumers to pay once and view everywhere. The effects of the end of net neutrality go well beyond the average internet users day-to-day experience.

- If the $85 billion deal goes through, ATT could potentially give special treatment to its newly acquired properties and zero-rate an unprecedented about of television content. Naturally, proponents of net neutrality are concerned about this and the pressure it would put on other companies to pay to also be zero-rated and have the chance to remain competitive.

- During his presidential campaign, Trump promised to block the deal, which might seem odd at first glance given his opposition to net neutrality, but many believe that was simply because of his frustrations with Time Warner-owned CNNs coverage of the election.

- This means any organization without deep enough pockets to pay an ISPs ransom will load much slower than those with ties to ISPs. Todays consumer expects websites to function at optimal speeds, and services to stream data without interruption, so those that dont are going to have a very hard time maintaining  let alone trying to grow  their audiences.

## CEO of Company Behind Tor Browser Exploit: "I Wanted to Help Take a Person Down" - Motherboard

- In November of last year, a law enforcement agency deployed a Tor Browser exploit on a dark web child abuse site

- the company which developed and sold the exploit was Exodus Intelligence

- Logan Brown, the company's president and CEO, has elaborated on why Exodus provided the exploit

- "I wanted to help take a person down,"

- This particular exploit took advantage of a vulnerability in Mozilla's Firefox browser

- "Six hours after we supplied it to them, they threw it, they got their guy, but it was reckless, it got monitored, and released."

## Researchers find severe flaw in WordPress plugin with 1 million installs

- More than 1 million websites running the WordPress content management system may be vulnerable to hacks that allow visitors to snatch password data and secret keys out of databases, at least under certain conditions. The vulnerability stems from a "severe" SQL injection bug in NextGEN Gallery, a WordPress plugin with more than 1 million installations.

- Until the flaw was recently fixed, NextGEN Gallery allowed input from untrusted visitors to be included in WordPress-prepared SQL queries.

- Under certain conditions, attackers can exploit the weakness to pipe powerful commands to a Web server's backend database. "This is quite a critical issue," Slavco Mihajloski, a researcher with Web security firm Sucuri, wrote in a blog post published Monday.

- Untrusted visitors could achieve this against sites that use the NextGEN Basic TagCloud gallery feature by making slight modifications to the gallery URL. "With this knowledge, an unauthenticated attacker could add extra sprintf/printf directives to the SQL query and use $wpdb-prepare's behavior to add attacker controlled code to the executed query," Monday's blog post explained. For the attack to work, a website would have to be set up to allow users to submit posts to be reviewed.

- An attacker could create an account on the site and submit a post that contains malformed NextGEN Gallery shortcodes. Mihajloski also described a scenario under which privileged authenticated users could perform the attack. Sucuri has assigned a severity rating of 9 out of a possible 10 points to the vulnerability, which was fixed in version 2.1.79 of the plugin.

## Google launches Meet, an enterprise-friendly version of Hangouts

- Google has quietly launched a new video conferencing application called Meet by Google Hangouts, which is designed for HD video meetings

- The web and mobile application appears to be the latest addition to Googles lineup of business products known as G Suite, though product page on the G Suite website listed in the apps description page on the App Store is not yet live.The URL meet.google.com, however, is somewhat up-and-running

- The site resembles the landing page for Hangouts, but without the options to place a phone call or start a text chat

- Instead, Meets page lets you enter a meeting code to join a meeting, as well as see those meetings you have scheduled

- There does not appear to be a way to schedule a new call from the site as of yet.Based on the screenshots and the App Stores detail page, it appears Meet is meant to serve as a business-friendly alternative to Hangouts, the companys consumer-focused messaging, voice and video chat application.Like Hangouts, Meet also offers group video calls, not just video chat, but in an expanded capacity.Where Hangouts is limited to 10 people, Meet says it supports high-def video meetings with up to 30 participants.                            screen696x696-9                                                        screen696x696-8                                                        screen696x696-7                                                        screen696x696-6                                                                                It also includes other features aimed at making it easy to access these calls while on the go, including dial-in numbers for those who are traveling, links you can join with just a click, and integration with Gmail and Calendar for G Suite users.The apps main screen displays a list of your scheduled meetings, along with other details like time, location, subject, attendees, and more

- You can click a green join button to attend a meeting from your phone, which launches the video chat interface

- Buttons let you mute your call or switch off video.Meanwhile, in large conferences, theres a main window at the top where you can watch whos talking, followed by a longer list of participants screens, names, and emails below.Dial-in numbers are available only to G Suite Enterprise Edition customers, but thats the only limitation noted so far.Google has not yet officially announced Meet, and the mobile app is only live on the iTunes App Store for the time being

- Launched yesterday, it has just started ranking in the U.S., at #1,177 in the Business category, according to data from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower

## A majority of millennials now reject capitalism, poll shows

-    (Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post; iStock; Emojipedia)  In an apparent rejection of the basic principles of the U.S

- economy, a new poll shows that most young people do not support capitalism. The Harvard University survey, which polled young adults between ages 18 and 29, found that 51 percent of respondents do not support capitalism

- Just 42 percent said they support it. It isn't clear that the young people in the poll would prefer some alternative system, though

- Just 33 percent said they supported socialism

- The survey had a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points. The results of the survey are difficult to interpret, pollsters noted

- Capitalism can mean different things to different people, and the newest generation of voters is frustrated with the status quo, broadly speaking. All the same, that a majority of respondents in Harvard University's survey of young adults said they do not support capitalism suggests that today's youngest voters are more focused on the flaws of free markets. "The word 'capitalism' doesn't mean what it used to," said Zach Lustbader, a senior at Harvard involved in conducting the poll, which was published Monday

- For those who grew up during the Cold War, capitalism meant freedom from the Soviet Union and other totalitarian regimes

- For those who grew up more recently, capitalism has meant a financial crisis from which the global economy still hasn't completely recovered.  A subsequent survey that included people of all ages found that somewhat older Americans also are skeptical of capitalism

## How Classical Cryptography Will Survive Quantum Computers - Facts So Romantic - Nautilus

- Some are looking at ways to fight quantum with quantumbut there is another (and cheaper) option.

- Quantum computation is based on the superposition principle of quantum physics

- Unfortunately for RSA, not all one-way functions are created equal. The factoring problem falls into a category known as hidden subgroup problems.

- That would be a big shake-up for public-key cryptography, but cryptographers arent just giving up. Some are looking at ways to fight quantum with quantumbut there is another (and cheaper) option

- esearch is also being done into what is often called post-quantum cryptography, although a more precise name might be quantum-resistant cryptography

- These problems include solving systems of multivariable polynomials, finding the shortest distance from a point to an n-dimensional skewed grid of other points, and finding the closest bit string to a set of other bit strings.

- lattice-based cryptography

## Audi Engineer Exposes Cheat Order

-  In an interesting turn of events last week in a German court, evidence has materialized that engineers were ordered to cheat emissions testing when developing automotive parts. Last Tuesday, Ulrich Wei brought forward a document that alleges Audi Board of Director members were involved in ordering a cheat for diesel emissions.

- Wei was the head of engine development for Audi, suspended in November of 2015 but continued to draw more than half a million dollars in salary before being fired after prior to last weeks court testimony. Volkswagen Group is the parent company of Audi and this all seems to have happened while the VW diesel emissions testing scandal weve covered since 2015 was beginning to come to light.

- Wei testified that he was asked to design a method of getting around strict emissions standards in Hong Kong even though Audi knew their diesel engines werent capable of doing so legitimately. According to Wei, he asked for a signed order.

- When he received that order he instructed his team to resist following it.

- We have not seen a copy of the letter, but the German tabloid newspaper Bild reports that the letter claims approval by four Audi board members and was signed by the head of powertrain development at the company. Hackaday was unable to locate any other sources reporting on the letter other than the Bild article we have linked to (also the source used in the Forbes article above).

## Mozilla Acquires Pocket and Its More Than 10 Million Users

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from Recode: Mozilla, the company behind the Firefox web browser, is buying Pocket, the read-it-later service, for an undisclosed amount.

- Founder Nate Weiner will continue to run Pocket, along with his team of about 25 people.

- Pocket, previously known as Read It Later, lets users bookmark articles, videos and other content to read or view later on the web or a mobile device.

- It's great for things like saving offline copies of web articles to read on plane rides or subway commutes, especially where internet access is sparse.

- Pocket, which was founded in 2007, has more than 10 million monthly active users, according to a rep. That's not bad, but suggests it's still a fairly niche service, especially as big firms like Facebook and Apple build simple "reading list" features into their platforms.

## 94% of Microsoft Vulnerabilities Can Be Mitigated By Turning Off Admin Righ

- 89463787story 94% of Microsoft Vulnerabilities Can Be Mitigated By Turning Off Admin Rights  (computerworld.com)   An anonymous reader quotes Computerworld: If you want to shut out the overwhelming majority of vulnerabilities in Microsoft products, turn off admin rights on the PC

- That's the conclusion from global endpoint security firm Avecto, which has issued its annual Microsoft Vulnerabilities report

- It found that there were 530 Microsoft vulnerabilities reported in 2016, and of these critical vulnerabilities, 94% were found to be mitigated by removing admin rights, up from 85% reported last year

- This is especially true with the browser, for those who still use Microsoft's browsers

- 100% of vulnerabilities impacting both Internet Explorer and Edge could be mitigated by removing admin rights, Avecto reported..

- Windows 10 was found to have the highest proportion of vulnerabilities of any OS (395), 46% more than Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 (265 each)

- Avecto found that 93% of Windows 10 vulnerabilities could be mitigated by removing admin rights

-  Of course, the stats are based on vulnerabilities announced in Microsoft Security Bulletins, but there's an overwhelming pattern

## ESET antivirus cracks opens Apple Macs to remote root execution via man-in-

- We couldn't possibly suggest you attack the latest vulnerability in ESET's antivirus software, because it's too basic to offer any challenge at all. As outlined in this advisory today, all you need to get root-level remote code execution on a Mac is to intercept the ESET antivirus package's connection to its backend servers, put yourself in as a man-in-the-middle, and exploit an XML library hole.  

- Or, to use the technically correct language of Google Security Team's Jason Geffner and Jan Bee: Vulnerable versions of ESET Endpoint Antivirus 6 are statically linked with an outdated XML parsing library and do not perform proper server authentication, allowing for remote unauthenticated attackers to perform arbitrary code execution as root on vulnerable clients. Lovely. The esets_daemon uses an old version of POCO's XML parser library that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow bug, aka CVE-2016-0718, they explain.

- Among other things, that library handles license activation with a request to https://edf.eset.com/edf: whatever data is sent back from that server can exploit the XML parser bug to potentially gain arbitrary code execution as root  the user assumed by ESET's antivirus. The man-in-the-middle diddle is possible because the daemon doesn't check ESET's licensing server certificate, allowing a malicious machine masquerading as the ESET licensing server to give the client a self-signed HTTPS cert.

- Now the attacker controls the connection, they can send malformed content to to the Mac to hijack the XML parser and execute code as root. "When ESET Endpoint Antivirus tries to activate its license, esets_daemon sends a request to https://edf.eset.com/edf," the Googlers explain. "The esets_daemon service does not validate the web server's certificate, so a man-in-the-middle can intercept the request and respond using a self-signed HTTPS certificate.

- The esets_daemon service parses the response as an XML document, thereby allowing the attacker to supply malformed content and exploit CVE-2016-0718 to achieve arbitrary code execution as root.

- According to TechCrunch, reporting from the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona today, Google's SVP of hardware Rick Osterloh has announced the second version of the Pixel laptop will be the last of its kind

- As TechCrunch notes, Google is trimming down the Pixel line to just the smartphones and the Pixel C tablet for now

- Although there may be other devices carrying the name in the future, Osterloh said it was unlikely that its own laptops would be one of them.

## Google Chrome 56's crypto tweak 'borked thousands of computers' using Blue

- Chromium's bug tracker indicates that Symantec's Blue Coat 6.5 security software can't handle TLS 1.3. Six days ago, an IT administrator with Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland reported that following the update to Chrome version 56, almost a third of the 50,000 Chromebooks he manages became "stuck in a state of flickering between a login screen and a 'Network not available' screen."

- The admin said Blue Coat 6.5 doesn't appear to support TLS 1.3. Attempts to reach the administrator via phone and email were unsuccessful and Montgomery County Public Schools' CTO Sherwin Collette did not respond to a request for comment. According to Google engineer David Benjamin, the issue is that Blue Coat implements TLS 1.3 incorrectly.

- Another Google employee posting to the list wrote that a customer using iBoss's security software also encountered problems following the Chrome update. However, an iBoss spokesperson told The Register that the company was aware of only one report and believes the problem in that instance is related to a customer configuration issue rather than the implementation of its software. Benjamin mentions "a list of buggy products."

- But Google did not respond to a request for further details. The Chromium team considered a rollback, but appears to have decided against it because TLS, when properly implemented, should be backwards compatible.

-  Updated to add Google has told The Register it has paused its TLS 1.3 deployment, and is working with various vendors to address issues that have emerged.

## Git fscked by SHA-1 collision? Not so fast, says Linus Torvalds

-                                 About that SHA-1 collision: Linus Torvalds has taken to Google+ to emphasise that in Git, its main role is error detection, so the sky isn't falling.                The weak hashing algorithm is used, among other things, to provide a digital signature for software, documents like PDFs, and encryption certificates

- The mathematical operation should produce a unique 40-character summary for any given input data, but CWI and Google's work showed it is reasonably possible now to produce SHA-1 collisions  for example, two different PDFs gave the same SHA-1 hash.                                                                                                        In the Git software repository system  authored by Torvalds  the SHA-1 hash of a repo's tree can be used to check you are fetching the code you think you're fetching.                An attacker could, using CWI and Google's findings, insert a backdoor in a program's source code in such a way that its repo's hash value collides with the hash value of a legit copy of the source  the hash value is the same for both despite the code being different

- Thus, a victim fetching the poisoned source would believe it's an untampered-with safe repo, because its hash matches the official legit tree, and ends up building and running a backdoored version.                Not so fast, Torvalds writes

- Here's what he said:                First off, the sky isn't falling

- There's a big difference between using a cryptographic hash for things like security signing, and using one for generating a 'content identifier' for a content-addressable system like git.                While the algorithm does have a security role even in Git, error correction is more important, Torvalds says, because trust should be a function of the community.                If you fetch a Linux kernel from Linus's repo, it's because that's where you expect the authoritative kernel to be: the hash is there so if someone tampered with the source, the signature won't match, and you know something's wrong

- Torvalds sees SHA-1 hashes of repos more as a checksum than proof the data you fetched is the data in the official repo, though.                In contrast, in a project like git, the hash isn't used for 'trust'

- I don't pull on people's trees because they have a hash of a4d442663580

- Our trust is in people, and then we end up having lots of technology measures in place to secure the actual data," he said.                Think of [SHA-1] like 'parity on steroids': it's not able to correct for errors, but it's really really good at detecting corrupt data. Torvalds continued:                Secondly, the nature of this particular SHA1 attack means that it's actually pretty easy to mitigate against, and there's already been two sets of patches posted for that mitigation.                The reason mitigation is pretty easy, he explained, is that to generate a collision, the attacker has to control both the good object and the bad object  and an attack is detectable on both sides of the collision.                For Git, this makes attacks hard to hide, unlike in the PDF-based proof of concept: The PDF format acted as the 'black box', and what you see is the printout which has only a very indirect relationship to the PDF encoding.                In other words, it's easy to stash within the PDF file magic data required to keep the SHA-1 value of the document the same after it has been tampered with

## $1,210: Bitcoin Price Hits New All-Time High

## $10 Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless

-     Today is Raspberry Pis fifth birthday: its five years since we launched the original Raspberry Pi, selling a hundred thousand units in the first day, and setting us on the road to a lifetime total (so far) of over twelve million units

- To celebrate, were announcing a new product: meet Raspberry Pi Zero W, a new variant of Raspberry Pi Zero with wireless LAN and Bluetooth, priced at only $10.Multum in parvoSo whats the story?In November 2015, we launched Raspberry Pi Zero, the diminutive $5 entry-level Raspberry Pi

- This represented a fivefold reduction in cost over the original Model A: it was cheap enough that we could even stick it on the front cover of The MagPi, risking civil insurrection in newsagents throughout the land.MagPi issue 40: causing trouble for WHSmith (credit: Adam Nicholls)Over the ensuing fifteen months, Zero grew a camera connector and found its way into everything from miniature arcade cabinets to electric skateboards

- Many of these use cases need wireless connectivity

- The homebrew People in Space indicator in the lobby at Pi Towers is a typical example, with an official wireless dongle hanging off the single USB port: users often end up adding a USB hub to allow them to connect a keyboard, a mouse and a network adapter, and this hub can easily cost more than the Zero itself.People in SPAAAAAACEZero W fixes this problem by integrating more functionality into the core product

- It uses the same Cypress CYW43438 wireless chip as Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to provide 802.11n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity.Pi Zero Announcement VideoMusic: Orqestruh by SAFAKASH  https://soundcloud.com/safakashTo recap, heres the full feature list for Zero W:1GHz, single-core CPU512MB RAMMini-HDMI portMicro-USB On-The-Go portMicro-USB powerHAT-compatible 40-pin headerComposite video and reset headersCSI camera connector802.11n wireless LANBluetooth 4.0We imagine youll find all sorts of uses for Zero W

- It makes a better general-purpose computer because youre less likely to need a hub: if youre using Bluetooth peripherals you might well end up with nothing at all plugged into the USB port

- And of course its a great platform for experimenting with IoT applications.Official caseTo accompany Raspberry Pi Zero W, weve been working with our friends at Kinneir Dufort and T-Zero to create an official injection-moulded case

## Google reports high-severity bug in Edge/IE, no patch available

-                   EnlargeCcetsnakebite    A member of Google's Project Zero security research team has disclosed a high-severity vulnerability in Microsoft's Edge and Internet Explorer browsers that reportedly allows attackers to execute malicious code in some instances.The vulnerability stems from what's known as a type-confusion bug in Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge, Project Zero researcher Ivan Fratric said in a report that he sent to Microsoft on November 25 and publicly disclosed on Monday

- The disclosure is in line with Google's policy of publishing vulnerability details 90 days after being privately reported

- A proof-of-concept exploit Fratric developed points to data stored in memory that he said "can be controlled by an attacker (with some limitations)." Asked by a commenter how easy it would be to bypass security measures designed to prevent code execution, Fratric wrote: "I will not make any further comments on exploitability, at least not until the bug is fixed

- The report has too much info on that as it is (I really didn't expect this one to miss the deadline)."Meanwhile, the National Vulnerability Database entry for the bug, which is indexed as CVE-2017-0037, warned that it "allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequence and crafted JavaScript code that operates on a [table-header] element." Microsoft representatives didn't have a comment at the time this post went live

- This post will be updated if they provide one later.Monday's disclosure is the second time in a week that Project Zero researchers have disclosed an unpatched security vulnerability in a Microsoft product

- Last Monday, Project Zero researcher Mateusz Jurczyk published details of a flaw in Windows that exposes potentially sensitive data stored in computer memory

- The two disclosures come after Microsoft canceled February's regularly scheduled batch of patches  for reasons officials have yet to explain

- Microsoft officials said they planned to resume the normal Patch Tuesday release cycle in March.Under Project Zero policy, researchers disclose vulnerability details 90 days after they are privately reported whether the flaw has been patched

Back to list          Status:    New        Owner:    ----              Type-Enhancement         Priority-Medium                              Reported by  , Nov 14, 2015  Since Android Marshmallow, "Direct Share" feature is added, enabling user to share to specific contact/app with 1 tap

- However, there's no option to disable the feature or edit which contacts we want to pin

- Based on observation, the contacts were added randomly(?), and they can't be removed afterward, even if the user never considers to share to them.1

- I'm thinking of a possibility to turn off direct share per-app on their app info

- Since this feature doesn't seem to require permission, I'm not sure adding it inside "Permissions" is a good idea

- Instead, perhaps adding a new "Sharings" option is more acceptable

- Inside, there's a Toggle for "Direct Sharing" to disable/enable.2

- For editing the contacts, put the option inside the same "Sharings" option

## Cloudbleed: Big web brands leaked crypto keys, personal secrets thanks to C

- Due to a programming blunder, for several months Cloudflare's systems slipped random chunks of server memory into some webpages, under certain circumstances.

- Think of it as sitting down at a restaurant, supposedly at a clean table, and in addition to being handed a menu, you're also handed the contents of the previous diner's wallet or purse. This leak was triggered when webpages had a particular combination of unbalanced HTML tags, which confused Cloudflare's proxy servers and caused them to spit out data belonging to other people  even if that data was protected by HTTPS.

- He found large chunks of data including session tokens and API keys, cookies and passwords in cached pages crawled by the Google search engine.

- These secrets can be used to log into services as someone else. "The examples we're finding are so bad, I cancelled some weekend plans to go into the office on Sunday to help build some tools to clean up," he said today in an advisory explaining the issue. "I've informed Cloudflare what I'm working on.

- If you use one of the affected websites, now would be a good time to log out or otherwise invalidate your session tokens, get new API keys if necessary, and log back in.  Updated to add on March 1 Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has blogged some more about the impact of Cloudbleed, attempting to down play the seriousness of the blunder in terms of the amount of sensitive information leaked.

## Bitcoin Price Sets New All-Time High

- Today's price high represents an increase of more than 4% since the start of the day's trading. At press time, the average price of bitcoin is $1,170.72, BPI data shows. A number of factors have buoyed prices  and positive trader sentiment  in recent weeks. Perhaps most notably, traders have taken a largely bullish tack on the prospects that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the first-ever bitcoin ETF.

- The SEC has a deadline of 11th March to make their final decision, which has already been subject to delays. The surge past the all-time high also follows a period of uncertainty and change within the global bitcoin market. January's defining markets storyline was the growing involvement of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, in the domestic bitcoin exchange space.

-  Feb 28, 2017 at 22:40 | Charles Bovaird $1,210: Bitcoin Price Hits New All-Time High Amid Sustained Support Bitcoin prices have traded above $1,000 for two weeks, providing evidence that the cryptocurrency has established support at this level.

-  Feb 25, 2017 at 14:58 | Pete Rizzo After New Highs, Bitcoin Price Faces Uncertain Path Ahead Bitcoin prices encountered some notable volatility after hitting an all-time high in the previous session.

-  Feb 23, 2017 at 09:23 | Daniel Palmer Bitcoin Price Surges to Within $30 of All-Time High The price of bitcoin has surged overnight, climbing to within $30 of its 2013 record high.

## CloudBleed and Coinbase

- CloudBleed and CoinbaseLast night, Coinbase became aware of a security bug with CloudFlare, a service Coinbase uses for Denial of Service protection

- This bug, now commonly known as CloudBleed, led to the leak of data from services that use CloudFlare in very specific and relatively rare circumstances

- We strongly believe that the foundation of trust is transparency, so we want to share a more in-depth analysis of how this event impacts Coinbase and our customers.Thus far, CloudFlare has identified about 150 CloudFlare customers, including Coinbase, affected by the bug

- To date, CloudFlare and Coinbase have identified only one single instance of a leaked Coinbase session cookie, which we immediately invalidated

- At this time, we are aware of no further impact

- The Coinbase security team will continue to work closely with CloudFlare to determine what, if any, other data may have been exposed by this event

- We have no reason to believe that any Coinbase customers personal data or account has been compromised

- Coinbases overall security architecture is designed to minimize the presence of any long term authentication credentials (for risks just like this)

## Google Has Demonstrated a Successful Practical Attack Against SHA-1

- 89408889story Google Has Demonstrated a Successful Practical Attack Against SHA-1  (googleblog.com)   Reader Artem Tashkinov writes: Ten years after of SHA-1 was first introduced, Google has announced the first practical technique for generating an SHA-1 collision

- It required two years of research between the CWI Institute in Amsterdam and Google

- As a proof of the attack, Google has released two PDF files that have identical SHA-1 hashes but different content

- The amount of computations required to carry out the attack is staggering: nine quintillion (9,223,372,036,854,775,808) SHA1 computations in total which took 6,500 years of CPU computation to complete the attack first phase and 110 years of GPU computation to complete the second phase. Google says that people should migrate to newer hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and SHA-3, however it's worth noting that there are currently no ways of finding a collision for both MD5 and SHA-1 hashes simultaneously which means that we still can use old proven hardware accelerated hash functions to be on the safe side.

## 'First ever' SHA-1 hash collision calculated. All it took were five clever

-                                 Google researchers and academics have today demonstrated it is possible  following years of number crunching  to produce two different documents that have the same SHA-1 hash signature.                This proves what we've long suspected: that SHA-1 is weak and can't be trusted

- This is bad news because the SHA-1 hashing algorithm is used across the internet, from Git repositories to file deduplication systems to HTTPS certificates used to protect online banking and other websites

- SHA-1 signatures are used to prove that blobs of data  which could be software source code, emails, PDFs, website certificates, etc  have not been tampered with by miscreants, or altered in any other way.                                                                                                        Now researchers at CWI Amsterdam and bods at Google have managed to alter a PDF without changing its SHA-1 hash value

- That makes it a lot easier to pass off the meddled-with version as the legit copy

- You could alter the contents of, say, a contract, and make its hash match that of the original

- Now you can trick someone into thinking the tampered copy is the original

- The hashes are completely the same.                SHA-1 is supposed to be deprecated but too many applications still support it, including the widely used source-code management tool Git

- It is possible to create two Git repositories with the same head commit SHA-1 hash and yet the contents of the two repos differ: one could have a backdoor stealthily added, for example, and you wouldn't know this from the hash

## SHAttered  SHA-1 is broken

-         A team from Google and CWI Amsterdam just announced it: they produced the first SHA-1 hash collision

- The attack required over 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 SHA-1 computations, the equivalent processing power as 6,500 years of single-CPU computations and 110 years of single-GPU computations

- While this may seem overwhelming, this is a practical attack if you are, lets say, a state-sponsored attacker

- Or if you control a large enough botnet

- Or if you are just able to spend some serious money on cloud computing

- Its doable

- Make no mistake, this is not a brute-force attack, that would take around 12,000,000 single-GPU years to complete.SHA-1 is a 160bit standard cryptographic hash function that is used for digital signatures and file integrity verification in a wide range of applications, such as digital certificates, PGP/GPG signatures, software updates, backup systems and so forth

- It was, a long time ago, proposed as a safe alternative to MD5, known to be faulty since 1996

## DNA tests show Subway sandwiches could contain just 50% chicken

-                                                                        Subway's oven-roasted chicken sandwich patty contained about 50 per cent chicken DNA, according to Marketplace's tests

- (CBC)                              Marketplace had chicken from 5 major fast food restaurants tested If you're one of many Canadians who opt for chicken sandwiches at your favourite fast food restaurant, you may find the results of a CBC Marketplace investigation into what's in the meat a little hard to swallow. A DNA analysis of the poultry in several popular grilled chicken sandwiches and wraps found at least one fast food restaurant isn't serving up nearly as much of the key ingredient as people may think. In the case of two popular Subway sandwiches, the chicken was found to contain only about half chicken DNA.   MARKETPLACE  The chicken challenge: testing your fast food  QUIZ: Ice cream or frozen dessert? What are you eating?  Will Mahood, a loyal customer who considered Subway chicken sandwiches a lunchtime staple, was alarmed by the findings

- To Mahood, messages from fast food companies can make it sound like "you're taking it straight from a farm and it's just a fresh piece of meat." DNA researcher Matt Harnden at Trent University's Wildlife Forensic DNA Laboratory tested the poultry in six popular chicken sandwiches

-    Healthy fast food? McDonald's kale salad has more calories than a Big Mac  Why Canada's fast food industry is moving to cage-free eggs  An unadulterated piece of chicken from the store should come in at 100 per cent chicken DNA

- Seasoning, marinating or processing meat would bring that number down, so fast food samples seasoned for taste wouldn't be expected to hit that 100 per cent target. The Peterborough, Ont.-based team tested the meat in:         McDonald's Country Chicken - Grilled     Wendy's Grilled Chicken Sandwich     AW Chicken Grill Deluxe     Tim Hortons Chipotle Chicken Grilled Wrap     Subway Oven Roasted Chicken Sandwich     Subway Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki (chicken strips)  NOTE: The tests were on the meat samples alone, without sauces or condiments.              In the first round of tests, the lab tested two samples of five of the meat products, and one sample of the Subway strips

- From each of those samples, the researchers isolated three smaller samples and tested each of those. They were all DNA tested and the score was then averaged for each sandwich

- Most of the scores were "very close" to 100 per cent chicken DNA, Harnden says

-           AW Chicken Grill Deluxe averaged 89.4 per cent chicken DNA      McDonald's Country Chicken - Grilled averaged 84.9 per cent chicken DNA     Tim Hortons Chipotle Chicken Grilled Wrap averaged 86.5 per cent chicken DNA     Wendy's Grilled Chicken Sandwich averaged 88.5 per cent chicken DNA           Subway's results were such an outlier that the team decided to test them again, biopsying five new oven roasted chicken pieces, and five new orders of chicken strips. Those results were averaged: the oven roasted chicken scored 53.6 per cent chicken DNA, and the chicken strips were found to have just 42.8 per cent chicken DNA. The majority of the remaining DNA? Soy.                                                                                                             The Chicken Challenge22:33             "That's misrepresentation," Irena Valenta, a Toronto resident who participated in a Marketplace taste test, said after seeing the test results. Subway said in a statement that it disagrees with the test results

## A Fake Dark Web Hitman Site is Linked to a Real Murder - Motherboard

- Stephen Allwine is allegedly a killer. According to a criminal complaint, Stephen is suspected of shooting his wife, Amy Allwine, in the head with a nine millimeter pistol in their Cottage Grove, Minnesota, home last year.

- But one key part of the story that led prosecutors to charge Stephen was his alleged, and failed, attempt to hire a hitman on the so-called dark web to murder Amy. That site, called Besa Mafia and ostensibly run by Albanian gangsters, was an elaborate scam, and in May a hacker posted the site's customer details and messages online, as Motherboard previously reported.

- He wanted Amy Allwine dead, and wanted to make it look like a car accident. That would cost $6,000, Besa Mafia replied.

- The drug, according to the criminal complaint, "is known to erase a person's memory, rendering them incapable of exercising their free will.

- Amy received more threats from an anonymous email account over the next few weeks, encouraging her to commit suicide.

- The next month, Stephen bought the handgun that would be used to kill Amy. Throughout the day she died, Amy had complained of feeling faint, and had searched the internet for "Vertigo-Wikipedia."

- A medical test conducted on Amy's body found her blood contained over forty five times higher the concentration of scopolamine than would be after a normal, therapeutic dose.

- Stephen is charged with second degree murder, was briefly released after posting a conditional bail of $500,000, but was arrested again after he tried to contact his and Amy's nine year old son, and track him with a GPS smartwatch. Stephen is banned from contacting him or Amy's parents, and faces a maximum of forty years in prison.

## Video calls for Signal now in public beta

-   Today's Signal release for Android and iOS includes beta support for video calls.This represents an entirely new calling infrastructure for Signal, and should increase voice call quality as well.We think it's a big improvement, but we're rolling it out in stages to collect feedback from people with differentdevices, networks, and regions in order to ensure there are no surprises when it's enabled for everyone by default.To help us test on Android and iOS, toggle Signal Settings - Advanced - Video calling beta.Only calls between Signal users who have both enabled the video calling beta will use the new calling system.CallKitEnabling the new calling features on iOS will also allow you to take advantage of CallKit in iOS 10.This allows incoming Signal calls to be answered with one touch, directly from the lock screen

- Keep in mind,this only takes effect when both parties are using the new calling system.CallKit offers a native calling experience to VoIP apps like Signal

- As well as being able to answer calls directly fromyour lock screen, youll also see Signal calls in the systems "Recent Calls" list

- This is because iOS treats CallKit callslike any other call, however that also means some information will be synced to iCloud if enabled

- This information includeswho you called and how long you talked.If you decide thats not for you, you can opt-out of the CallKit features at any time inSettings  Advanced  Use CallKit, while continuing to use the rest of the new calling system.Technical detailsBackgroundSignal used to be two different applications, one for texting and one for real-time voice calls

- Until now, thecode for text and voice has remained relatively separate, even after both pieces were merged into one application.At a high level, most VoIP applications consist of two parts: signaling and streaming

- There is a "signaling"pathway that sets up a call and negotiates some media streams, and then a "streaming" pathway that actually transmitsthe audio, video, or data once the call has "begun."Traditionally, the signaling pathway in VoIP applications used protocols likeSIP, while the streaming pathway usedRTP orSRTP.We originally developed voice calling in the early days of mobile devices, when everyone was stillfiguring out that world, and when projects like webrtc didn't yet exist

- We immediately realizedthat protocols like SIP, which traditionally required holding open long-lived connnections in order to receive incomingcalls, were not going to be compatible with the mobile environment.Instead we built our own simple REST-based signaling protocol (seems hard to believe now, but not using SIP wascontroversial at the time!), and used push notifications instead of long-lived connections to notify the client ofincoming calls

## Now sites can fingerprint you online even when you use multiple browsers

-                   Enlarge / System architecture of a cross-browser tracking system.Cao et al.    Researchers have recently developed the first reliable technique for websites to track visitors even when they use two or more different browsers

- This shatters a key defense against sites that identify visitors based on the digital fingerprint their browsers leave behind.State-of-the-art fingerprinting techniques are highly effective at identifying users when they use browsers with default or commonly used settings

- For instance, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's privacy tool, known as Panopticlick, found that only one in about 77,691 browsers had the same characteristics as the one commonly used by this reporter

- Such fingerprints are the result of specific settings and customizations found in a specific browser installation, including the list of plugins, the selected time zone, whether a "do not track" option is turned on, and whether an adblocker is being used.Until now, however, the tracking has been limited to a single browser

- This constraint made it infeasible to tie, say, the fingerprint left behind by a Firefox browser to the fingerprint from a Chrome or Edge installation running on the same machine

- The new techniqueoutlined in a research paper titled (Cross-)Browser Fingerprinting via OS and Hardware Level Featuresnot only works across multiple browsers, it's also more accurate than previous single-browser fingerprinting.Fingerprinting isn't automatically bad and, in some cases, offers potential benefits to end users

- Banks, for instance, can use it to know that a person logging into an online account isn't using the computer that has been used on every previous visit

- Based on that observation, the bank could check with the account holder by phone to make sure the login was legitimate

## Former NSA contractor may have stolen 75% of TAOs elite hacking tools

-             On Monday, The Washington Post reported one of the most stunning breaches of security ever

- A former NSA contractor, the paper said, stole more than 50 terabytes of highly sensitive data

- According to one source, that includes more than 75 percent of the hacking tools belonging to the Tailored Access Operations

- TAO is an elite hacking unit that develops and deploys some of the world's most sophisticated software exploits.Attorneys representing Harold T

- Martin III have previously portrayed the former NSA contractor as a patriot who took NSA materials home so that he could become better at his job

- Meanwhile, investigators who have combed through his home in Glen Burnie, Maryland, remain concerned that he passed the weaponized hacking tools to enemies

- The theft came to light during the investigation of a series of NSA-developed exploits that were mysteriously published online by a group calling itself Shadow Brokers.Investigators have floated several theories

- One holds that Martin directly provided the tools to the person or group responsible for the leak

## F5's Big-IP leaks little chunks of memory, even SSL session IDs

- There's a new branded bug in town, but thankfully it only hurts kit made by F5 Networks.

- Ticketbleed (so named for a similarity to the notorious 2014 Heartbleed) is specific to F5's Big-IP appliances and can strike when virtual servers running on those boxes are configured with a Client SSL profile that has the non-default Session Tickets option.

- Such servers can be tricked into leaking 31 bytes at a time of memory. As F5 explains in the post announcing its patch, A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability to obtain Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) session IDs from other sessions. It is possible that other data from uninitialized memory may be returned as well.
